## 原始摘要

Advances in experimental techniques allow the collection of high-resolution
spatio-temporal data that track individual motile entities over time. These
tracking data motivate the use of mathematical models to characterise the
motion observed. In this paper, we aim to describe the solutions of
velocity-jump models for single-agent motion in one spatial dimension,
characterised by successive Markovian transitions within a finite network of n
states, each with a specified velocity and a fixed rate of switching to every
other state. In particular, we focus on obtaining the solutions of the model
subject to noisy, discrete-time, observations, with no direct access to the
agent state. The lack of direct observation of the hidden state makes the
problem of finding the exact distributions generally intractable. Therefore, we
derive a series of approximations for the data distributions. We verify the
accuracy of these approximations by comparing them to the empirical
distributions generated through simulations of four example model structures.
These comparisons confirm that the approximations are accurate given
sufficiently infrequent state switching relative to the imaging frequency. The
approximate distributions computed can be used to obtain fast forwards
predictions, to give guidelines on experimental design, and as likelihoods for
inference and model selection.
