## 原始摘要

Advances in experimental techniques allow the collection of high-resolution
spatio-temporal data that track individual motile entities over time. These
tracking data motivate the use of mathematical models to characterise the
motion observed. In this paper, we aim to describe the solutions of
velocity-jump models for single-agent motion in one spatial dimension,
characterised by successive Markovian transitions within a finite network of n
states, each with a specified velocity and a fixed rate of switching to every
other state. In particular, we focus on obtaining the solutions of the model
subject to noisy, discrete-time, observations, with no direct access to the
agent state. The lack of direct observation of the hidden state makes the
problem of finding the exact distributions generally intractable. Therefore, we
derive a series of approximations for the data distributions. We verify the
accuracy of these approximations by comparing them to the empirical
distributions generated through simulations of four example model structures.
These comparisons confirm that the approximations are accurate given
sufficiently infrequent state switching relative to the imaging frequency. The
approximate distributions computed can be used to obtain fast forwards
predictions, to give guidelines on experimental design, and as likelihoods for
inference and model selection.

这篇论文研究了速度跳跃模型在一维空间中对单个运动个体的建模。针对离散时间噪声观测且无法直接获取个体状态的情况，研究者推导了一系列近似数据分布的方法。通过四种模型结构的仿真对比验证，这些近似方法在状态转换频率足够低于观测频率时表现准确。所得近似分布可用于快速预测、指导实验设计，以及作为推断和模型选择的似然函数。研究重点解决了隐马尔可夫模型在缺乏直接状态观测时的分布求解难题，为处理高分辨率时空追踪数据提供了有效工具。
