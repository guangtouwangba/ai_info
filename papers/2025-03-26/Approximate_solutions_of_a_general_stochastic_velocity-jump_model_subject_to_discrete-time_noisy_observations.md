## 原始摘要

Advances in experimental techniques allow the collection of high-resolution
spatio-temporal data that track individual motile entities over time. These
tracking data motivate the use of mathematical models to characterise the
motion observed. In this paper, we aim to describe the solutions of
velocity-jump models for single-agent motion in one spatial dimension,
characterised by successive Markovian transitions within a finite network of n
states, each with a specified velocity and a fixed rate of switching to every
other state. In particular, we focus on obtaining the solutions of the model
subject to noisy, discrete-time, observations, with no direct access to the
agent state. The lack of direct observation of the hidden state makes the
problem of finding the exact distributions generally intractable. Therefore, we
derive a series of approximations for the data distributions. We verify the
accuracy of these approximations by comparing them to the empirical
distributions generated through simulations of four example model structures.
These comparisons confirm that the approximations are accurate given
sufficiently infrequent state switching relative to the imaging frequency. The
approximate distributions computed can be used to obtain fast forwards
predictions, to give guidelines on experimental design, and as likelihoods for
inference and model selection.

这篇论文研究了基于速度跳跃模型的单代理一维运动问题，重点关注在无法直接观测代理状态的情况下，处理离散时间噪声观测数据的解决方案。由于隐藏状态导致精确分布难以求解，作者提出了一系列近似分布方法，并通过四种模型结构的仿真实验验证了这些近似方法的准确性。结果表明，当状态切换频率足够低于成像频率时，近似效果良好。这些近似分布可用于快速预测、实验设计指导以及模型选择和推断的似然计算。研究为处理高分辨率时空跟踪数据提供了实用的数学建模工具。
