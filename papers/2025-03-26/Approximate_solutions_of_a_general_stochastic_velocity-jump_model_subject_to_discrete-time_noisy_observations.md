## 原始摘要

Advances in experimental techniques allow the collection of high-resolution
spatio-temporal data that track individual motile entities over time. These
tracking data motivate the use of mathematical models to characterise the
motion observed. In this paper, we aim to describe the solutions of
velocity-jump models for single-agent motion in one spatial dimension,
characterised by successive Markovian transitions within a finite network of n
states, each with a specified velocity and a fixed rate of switching to every
other state. In particular, we focus on obtaining the solutions of the model
subject to noisy, discrete-time, observations, with no direct access to the
agent state. The lack of direct observation of the hidden state makes the
problem of finding the exact distributions generally intractable. Therefore, we
derive a series of approximations for the data distributions. We verify the
accuracy of these approximations by comparing them to the empirical
distributions generated through simulations of four example model structures.
These comparisons confirm that the approximations are accurate given
sufficiently infrequent state switching relative to the imaging frequency. The
approximate distributions computed can be used to obtain fast forwards
predictions, to give guidelines on experimental design, and as likelihoods for
inference and model selection.

这篇论文研究了基于速度跳跃模型的一维单智能体运动问题，其中智能体在有限状态网络中进行马尔可夫切换，每个状态具有特定速度和固定切换率。针对无法直接观测隐藏状态、仅能获取离散时间噪声观测数据的情况，作者提出了一系列近似分布方法来解决精确分布难以求解的问题。通过四种模型结构的模拟实验验证，这些近似在状态切换频率远低于观测频率时表现良好。这些近似分布可用于快速预测、实验设计指导以及模型选择和推断的似然计算。
