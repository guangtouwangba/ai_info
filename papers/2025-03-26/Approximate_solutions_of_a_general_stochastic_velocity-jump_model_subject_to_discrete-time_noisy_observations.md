## 原始摘要

Advances in experimental techniques allow the collection of high-resolution
spatio-temporal data that track individual motile entities over time. These
tracking data motivate the use of mathematical models to characterise the
motion observed. In this paper, we aim to describe the solutions of
velocity-jump models for single-agent motion in one spatial dimension,
characterised by successive Markovian transitions within a finite network of n
states, each with a specified velocity and a fixed rate of switching to every
other state. In particular, we focus on obtaining the solutions of the model
subject to noisy, discrete-time, observations, with no direct access to the
agent state. The lack of direct observation of the hidden state makes the
problem of finding the exact distributions generally intractable. Therefore, we
derive a series of approximations for the data distributions. We verify the
accuracy of these approximations by comparing them to the empirical
distributions generated through simulations of four example model structures.
These comparisons confirm that the approximations are accurate given
sufficiently infrequent state switching relative to the imaging frequency. The
approximate distributions computed can be used to obtain fast forwards
predictions, to give guidelines on experimental design, and as likelihoods for
inference and model selection.

这篇论文研究了基于速度跳跃模型的单智能体一维运动问题。该模型通过有限状态网络描述运动，每个状态有特定速度和固定转换率。研究重点是在无法直接观测智能体状态的情况下，通过离散噪声观测数据求解模型。由于精确分布难以计算，作者提出了一系列近似分布方法，并通过四种模型结构的仿真验证了其准确性。结果表明，当状态转换频率足够低于成像频率时，这些近似分布是准确的。这些近似分布可用于快速预测、实验设计指导以及作为推断和模型选择的似然函数。
