# Reanimating Images using Neural Representations of Dynamic Stimuli

## 原始摘要

While computer vision models have made incredible strides in static image
recognition, they still do not match human performance in tasks that require
the understanding of complex, dynamic motion. This is notably true for
real-world scenarios where embodied agents face complex and motion-rich
environments. Our approach, BrainNRDS (Brain-Neural Representations of Dynamic
Stimuli), leverages state-of-the-art video diffusion models to decouple static
image representation from motion generation, enabling us to utilize fMRI brain
activity for a deeper understanding of human responses to dynamic visual
stimuli. Conversely, we also demonstrate that information about the brain's
representation of motion can enhance the prediction of optical flow in
artificial systems. Our novel approach leads to four main findings: (1) Visual
motion, represented as fine-grained, object-level resolution optical flow, can
be decoded from brain activity generated by participants viewing video stimuli;
(2) Video encoders outperform image-based models in predicting video-driven
brain activity; (3) Brain-decoded motion signals enable realistic video
reanimation based only on the initial frame of the video; and (4) We extend
prior work to achieve full video decoding from video-driven brain activity.
BrainNRDS advances our understanding of how the brain represents spatial and
temporal information in dynamic visual scenes. Our findings demonstrate the
potential of combining brain imaging with video diffusion models for developing
more robust and biologically-inspired computer vision systems. We show
additional decoding and encoding examples on this site:

## AI 摘要

BrainNRDS利用先进的视频扩散模型，将静态图像表征与动态运动生成解耦，通过fMRI脑活动数据解析人类对动态视觉刺激的响应。研究发现：1）从观看视频的脑活动中可解码出细粒度物体级光流运动表征；2）视频编码器在预测视频驱动的脑活动时优于图像模型；3）基于脑解码的运动信号可实现仅用视频首帧的真实视频重动画；4）实现了从脑活动完整解码视频。该研究揭示了大脑如何表征动态视觉场景的时空信息，展示了脑成像与视频扩散模型结合开发生物启发的鲁棒计算机视觉系统的潜力。
