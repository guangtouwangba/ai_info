# Reanimating Images using Neural Representations of Dynamic Stimuli

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02659v3

## 原始摘要

While computer vision models have made incredible strides in static image
recognition, they still do not match human performance in tasks that require
the understanding of complex, dynamic motion. This is notably true for
real-world scenarios where embodied agents face complex and motion-rich
environments. Our approach, BrainNRDS (Brain-Neural Representations of Dynamic
Stimuli), leverages state-of-the-art video diffusion models to decouple static
image representation from motion generation, enabling us to utilize fMRI brain
activity for a deeper understanding of human responses to dynamic visual
stimuli. Conversely, we also demonstrate that information about the brain's
representation of motion can enhance the prediction of optical flow in
artificial systems. Our novel approach leads to four main findings: (1) Visual
motion, represented as fine-grained, object-level resolution optical flow, can
be decoded from brain activity generated by participants viewing video stimuli;
(2) Video encoders outperform image-based models in predicting video-driven
brain activity; (3) Brain-decoded motion signals enable realistic video
reanimation based only on the initial frame of the video; and (4) We extend
prior work to achieve full video decoding from video-driven brain activity.
BrainNRDS advances our understanding of how the brain represents spatial and
temporal information in dynamic visual scenes. Our findings demonstrate the
potential of combining brain imaging with video diffusion models for developing
more robust and biologically-inspired computer vision systems. We show
additional decoding and encoding examples on this site:
