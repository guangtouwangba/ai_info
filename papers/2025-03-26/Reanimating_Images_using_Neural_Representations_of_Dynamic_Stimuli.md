# Reanimating Images using Neural Representations of Dynamic Stimuli

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02659v3

## 原始摘要

While computer vision models have made incredible strides in static image
recognition, they still do not match human performance in tasks that require
the understanding of complex, dynamic motion. This is notably true for
real-world scenarios where embodied agents face complex and motion-rich
environments. Our approach, BrainNRDS (Brain-Neural Representations of Dynamic
Stimuli), leverages state-of-the-art video diffusion models to decouple static
image representation from motion generation, enabling us to utilize fMRI brain
activity for a deeper understanding of human responses to dynamic visual
stimuli. Conversely, we also demonstrate that information about the brain's
representation of motion can enhance the prediction of optical flow in
artificial systems. Our novel approach leads to four main findings: (1) Visual
motion, represented as fine-grained, object-level resolution optical flow, can
be decoded from brain activity generated by participants viewing video stimuli;
(2) Video encoders outperform image-based models in predicting video-driven
brain activity; (3) Brain-decoded motion signals enable realistic video
reanimation based only on the initial frame of the video; and (4) We extend
prior work to achieve full video decoding from video-driven brain activity.
BrainNRDS advances our understanding of how the brain represents spatial and
temporal information in dynamic visual scenes. Our findings demonstrate the
potential of combining brain imaging with video diffusion models for developing
more robust and biologically-inspired computer vision systems. We show
additional decoding and encoding examples on this site:

## AI 摘要

这篇论文介绍了BrainNRDS方法，通过结合fMRI脑成像数据和视频扩散模型，研究人类对动态视觉刺激的理解。研究发现：(1) 可以从观看视频时的大脑活动中解码出细粒度的光流运动信息；(2) 视频编码器比静态图像模型更能预测视频驱动的大脑活动；(3) 仅用视频首帧和脑解码的运动信号就能实现视频重动画；(4) 实现了从脑活动解码完整视频。该方法揭示了大脑如何表征动态视觉场景的时空信息，为开发生物启发的计算机视觉系统提供了新思路。论文网站展示了更多解码/编码示例。
