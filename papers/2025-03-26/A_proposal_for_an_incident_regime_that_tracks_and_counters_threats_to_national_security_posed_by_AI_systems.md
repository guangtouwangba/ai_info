# A proposal for an incident regime that tracks and counters threats to national security posed by AI systems

## 原始摘要

Recent progress in AI capabilities has heightened concerns that AI systems
could pose a threat to national security, for example, by making it easier for
malicious actors to perform cyberattacks on critical national infrastructure,
or through loss of control of autonomous AI systems. In parallel, federal
legislators in the US have proposed nascent 'AI incident regimes' to identify
and counter similar threats. In this paper, we consolidate these two trends and
present a proposal for a legally mandated post-deployment AI incident regie
that aims to counter potential national security threats from AI systems. We
start the paper by introducing the concept of 'security-critical' to describe
doctors that pose extreme risks to national security, before arguing that
'security-critical' describes civilian nuclear power, aviation, life science
dual-use research of concern, and frontier AI development. We then present in
detail our AI incident regime proposal,, justifying each component of the
proposal by demonstrating its similarity to US domestic incident regimes in
other 'security-critical' sectors. Finally, we sketch a hypothetical scenario
where our proposed AI incident regime deals with an AI cyber incident. Our
proposed AI incident regime is split into three phases. The first phase
revolves around a novel operationalization of what counts as an 'AI incident'
and we suggest that AI providers must create a 'national security case' before
deploying a frontier AI system. The second and third phases spell out that AI
providers should notify a government agency about incidents, and that the
government agency should be involved in amending AI providers' security and
safety procedures, in order to counter future threats to national security. Our
proposal is timely, given ongoing policy interest in the potential national
security threats posed by AI systems.


## AI 摘要

近期AI技术进步引发国家安全担忧，如恶意网络攻击或自主AI失控风险。为此，美国立法者提出"AI事件管理机制"应对威胁。本文提出法定AI部署后事件管理方案，将核能、航空等"安全关键领域"监管框架延伸至前沿AI系统。提案分三阶段：1)部署前需提交"国家安全论证"；2)事故强制上报；3)政府参与修正安全协议。通过类比现有高危行业监管模式，方案旨在系统性防范AI国家安全风险。研究呼应当前政策关切，为AI安全治理提供制度设计参考，特别针对可能引发重大危机的AI网络事件场景。
