# A proposal for an incident regime that tracks and counters threats to national security posed by AI systems

## 原始摘要

Recent progress in AI capabilities has heightened concerns that AI systems
could pose a threat to national security, for example, by making it easier for
malicious actors to perform cyberattacks on critical national infrastructure,
or through loss of control of autonomous AI systems. In parallel, federal
legislators in the US have proposed nascent 'AI incident regimes' to identify
and counter similar threats. In this paper, we consolidate these two trends and
present a proposal for a legally mandated post-deployment AI incident regie
that aims to counter potential national security threats from AI systems. We
start the paper by introducing the concept of 'security-critical' to describe
doctors that pose extreme risks to national security, before arguing that
'security-critical' describes civilian nuclear power, aviation, life science
dual-use research of concern, and frontier AI development. We then present in
detail our AI incident regime proposal,, justifying each component of the
proposal by demonstrating its similarity to US domestic incident regimes in
other 'security-critical' sectors. Finally, we sketch a hypothetical scenario
where our proposed AI incident regime deals with an AI cyber incident. Our
proposed AI incident regime is split into three phases. The first phase
revolves around a novel operationalization of what counts as an 'AI incident'
and we suggest that AI providers must create a 'national security case' before
deploying a frontier AI system. The second and third phases spell out that AI
providers should notify a government agency about incidents, and that the
government agency should be involved in amending AI providers' security and
safety procedures, in order to counter future threats to national security. Our
proposal is timely, given ongoing policy interest in the potential national
security threats posed by AI systems.


## AI 摘要

近期AI能力的快速发展引发了对国家安全威胁的担忧，如恶意网络攻击或自主AI系统失控。为此，美国联邦立法者提出建立"AI事件管理机制"来应对这些风险。本文建议实施一个法定的AI部署后事件管理机制，将AI与核能、航空等列为"安全关键"领域。该机制分为三阶段：(1)AI提供商需在部署前沿系统前提交"国家安全案例"并明确定义AI事件；(2)发生事件时需向政府报告；(3)政府参与修订安全措施以防范未来威胁。该提案针对当前政策关注的AI国家安全风险提出了具体应对框架。
