# A proposal for an incident regime that tracks and counters threats to national security posed by AI systems

## 原始摘要

Recent progress in AI capabilities has heightened concerns that AI systems
could pose a threat to national security, for example, by making it easier for
malicious actors to perform cyberattacks on critical national infrastructure,
or through loss of control of autonomous AI systems. In parallel, federal
legislators in the US have proposed nascent 'AI incident regimes' to identify
and counter similar threats. In this paper, we consolidate these two trends and
present a proposal for a legally mandated post-deployment AI incident regie
that aims to counter potential national security threats from AI systems. We
start the paper by introducing the concept of 'security-critical' to describe
doctors that pose extreme risks to national security, before arguing that
'security-critical' describes civilian nuclear power, aviation, life science
dual-use research of concern, and frontier AI development. We then present in
detail our AI incident regime proposal,, justifying each component of the
proposal by demonstrating its similarity to US domestic incident regimes in
other 'security-critical' sectors. Finally, we sketch a hypothetical scenario
where our proposed AI incident regime deals with an AI cyber incident. Our
proposed AI incident regime is split into three phases. The first phase
revolves around a novel operationalization of what counts as an 'AI incident'
and we suggest that AI providers must create a 'national security case' before
deploying a frontier AI system. The second and third phases spell out that AI
providers should notify a government agency about incidents, and that the
government agency should be involved in amending AI providers' security and
safety procedures, in order to counter future threats to national security. Our
proposal is timely, given ongoing policy interest in the potential national
security threats posed by AI systems.


## AI 摘要

本文提出建立AI事件管理制度以应对AI系统对国家安全构成的潜在威胁。作者将"安全关键"领域（如核能、航空、生物双用途研究）的概念扩展到前沿AI开发，建议实施三阶段监管框架：1)部署前需提交"国家安全案例"并定义AI事件标准；2)要求AI供应商向政府机构报告事件；3)政府参与修订安全程序以防范未来风险。该提案借鉴了美国其他关键行业的监管经验，并通过模拟AI网络事件场景验证其可行性。研究呼应了当前政策界对AI国家安全风险的关注，为立法提供了具体方案。（99字）
