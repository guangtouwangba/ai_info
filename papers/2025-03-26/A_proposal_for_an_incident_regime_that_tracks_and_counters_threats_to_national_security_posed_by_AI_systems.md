# A proposal for an incident regime that tracks and counters threats to national security posed by AI systems

## 原始摘要

Recent progress in AI capabilities has heightened concerns that AI systems
could pose a threat to national security, for example, by making it easier for
malicious actors to perform cyberattacks on critical national infrastructure,
or through loss of control of autonomous AI systems. In parallel, federal
legislators in the US have proposed nascent 'AI incident regimes' to identify
and counter similar threats. In this paper, we consolidate these two trends and
present a proposal for a legally mandated post-deployment AI incident regie
that aims to counter potential national security threats from AI systems. We
start the paper by introducing the concept of 'security-critical' to describe
doctors that pose extreme risks to national security, before arguing that
'security-critical' describes civilian nuclear power, aviation, life science
dual-use research of concern, and frontier AI development. We then present in
detail our AI incident regime proposal,, justifying each component of the
proposal by demonstrating its similarity to US domestic incident regimes in
other 'security-critical' sectors. Finally, we sketch a hypothetical scenario
where our proposed AI incident regime deals with an AI cyber incident. Our
proposed AI incident regime is split into three phases. The first phase
revolves around a novel operationalization of what counts as an 'AI incident'
and we suggest that AI providers must create a 'national security case' before
deploying a frontier AI system. The second and third phases spell out that AI
providers should notify a government agency about incidents, and that the
government agency should be involved in amending AI providers' security and
safety procedures, in order to counter future threats to national security. Our
proposal is timely, given ongoing policy interest in the potential national
security threats posed by AI systems.


## AI 摘要

随着AI能力的快速进步，其对国家安全的潜在威胁引发担忧，如恶意网络攻击或自主AI失控。为此，美国立法者提出建立"AI事件监管机制"应对此类风险。本文提出一个强制性的AI部署后监管框架，将核能、航空等"安全关键"领域的现有监管模式应用于AI。该机制分三阶段：(1)AI提供商部署前沿系统前需提交"国家安全论证"；(2)发生事件时需向政府报告；(3)政府参与修订安全规程以防范未来威胁。研究通过假设性网络事件案例，论证该机制如何有效应对AI带来的国家安全挑战，呼应当前政策关注焦点。
