# Aether: Geometric-Aware Unified World Modeling

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18945v2

## 原始摘要

The integration of geometric reconstruction and generative modeling remains a
critical challenge in developing AI systems capable of human-like spatial
reasoning. This paper proposes Aether, a unified framework that enables
geometry-aware reasoning in world models by jointly optimizing three core
capabilities: (1) 4D dynamic reconstruction, (2) action-conditioned video
prediction, and (3) goal-conditioned visual planning. Through task-interleaved
feature learning, Aether achieves synergistic knowledge sharing across
reconstruction, prediction, and planning objectives. Building upon video
generation models, our framework demonstrates unprecedented synthetic-to-real
generalization despite never observing real-world data during training.
Furthermore, our approach achieves zero-shot generalization in both action
following and reconstruction tasks, thanks to its intrinsic geometric modeling.
Remarkably, even without real-world data, its reconstruction performance is
comparable with or even better than that of domain-specific models.
Additionally, Aether employs camera trajectories as geometry-informed action
spaces, enabling effective action-conditioned prediction and visual planning.
We hope our work inspires the community to explore new frontiers in
physically-reasonable world modeling and its applications.


## AI 摘要

本文提出Aether框架，通过联合优化4D动态重建、动作条件视频预测和目标条件视觉规划三大核心能力，实现几何感知的世界建模。该框架采用任务交错特征学习，促进重建、预测和规划任务间的知识共享。基于视频生成模型，Aether展现出前所未有的合成-真实泛化能力，且无需真实数据训练即可实现动作跟随和重建任务的零样本泛化。其重建性能媲美甚至超越领域专用模型，并利用相机轨迹作为几何感知动作空间，实现有效的动作条件预测和视觉规划。该研究为物理合理世界建模开辟了新方向。
