**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22605v1

## 原始摘要

The rise of hardware-level security threats, such as side-channel attacks,
hardware Trojans, and firmware vulnerabilities, demands advanced detection
mechanisms that are more intelligent and adaptive. Traditional methods often
fall short in addressing the complexity and evasiveness of modern attacks,
driving increased interest in machine learning-based solutions. Among these,
Transformer models, widely recognized for their success in natural language
processing and computer vision, have gained traction in the security domain due
to their ability to model complex dependencies, offering enhanced capabilities
in identifying vulnerabilities, detecting anomalies, and reinforcing system
integrity. This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent advancements
on the use of Transformers in hardware security, examining their application
across key areas such as side-channel analysis, hardware Trojan detection,
vulnerability classification, device fingerprinting, and firmware security.
Furthermore, we discuss the practical challenges of applying Transformers to
secure hardware systems, and highlight opportunities and future research
directions that position them as a foundation for next-generation
hardware-assisted security. These insights pave the way for deeper integration
of AI-driven techniques into hardware security frameworks, enabling more
resilient and intelligent defenses.


## AI 摘要

随着硬件级安全威胁（如侧信道攻击、硬件木马和固件漏洞）的兴起，传统检测方法难以应对现代攻击的复杂性和隐蔽性，因此基于机器学习的解决方案受到关注。Transformer模型凭借其在复杂依赖关系建模上的优势，在硬件安全领域展现出潜力，广泛应用于侧信道分析、硬件木马检测、漏洞分类、设备指纹识别和固件安全等关键领域。尽管实际应用中仍存在挑战，但Transformer有望成为下一代硬件辅助安全的基础。AI驱动技术的深入整合将为硬件安全框架提供更智能、更强大的防御能力，推动未来研究方向。
