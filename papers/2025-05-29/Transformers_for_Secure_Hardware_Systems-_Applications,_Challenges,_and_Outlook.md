**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22605v1

## 原始摘要

The rise of hardware-level security threats, such as side-channel attacks,
hardware Trojans, and firmware vulnerabilities, demands advanced detection
mechanisms that are more intelligent and adaptive. Traditional methods often
fall short in addressing the complexity and evasiveness of modern attacks,
driving increased interest in machine learning-based solutions. Among these,
Transformer models, widely recognized for their success in natural language
processing and computer vision, have gained traction in the security domain due
to their ability to model complex dependencies, offering enhanced capabilities
in identifying vulnerabilities, detecting anomalies, and reinforcing system
integrity. This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent advancements
on the use of Transformers in hardware security, examining their application
across key areas such as side-channel analysis, hardware Trojan detection,
vulnerability classification, device fingerprinting, and firmware security.
Furthermore, we discuss the practical challenges of applying Transformers to
secure hardware systems, and highlight opportunities and future research
directions that position them as a foundation for next-generation
hardware-assisted security. These insights pave the way for deeper integration
of AI-driven techniques into hardware security frameworks, enabling more
resilient and intelligent defenses.


## AI 摘要

随着硬件级安全威胁（如侧信道攻击、硬件木马和固件漏洞）的兴起，传统检测方法难以应对现代攻击的复杂性，因此基于机器学习（尤其是Transformer模型）的解决方案受到关注。Transformer凭借其建模复杂依赖关系的能力，在硬件安全领域展现出优势，包括侧信道分析、硬件木马检测、漏洞分类、设备指纹识别和固件安全等。尽管实际应用中存在挑战，但Transformer为下一代硬件辅助安全奠定了基础，推动了AI驱动技术与硬件安全框架的深度融合，有望实现更智能、更鲁棒的防御系统。
