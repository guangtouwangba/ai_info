# Paper2Poster: Towards Multimodal Poster Automation from Scientific Papers

## 原始摘要

Academic poster generation is a crucial yet challenging task in scientific
communication, requiring the compression of long-context interleaved documents
into a single, visually coherent page. To address this challenge, we introduce
the first benchmark and metric suite for poster generation, which pairs recent
conference papers with author-designed posters and evaluates outputs on
(i)Visual Quality-semantic alignment with human posters, (ii)Textual
Coherence-language fluency, (iii)Holistic Assessment-six fine-grained aesthetic
and informational criteria scored by a VLM-as-judge, and notably
(iv)PaperQuiz-the poster's ability to convey core paper content as measured by
VLMs answering generated quizzes. Building on this benchmark, we propose
PosterAgent, a top-down, visual-in-the-loop multi-agent pipeline: the (a)Parser
distills the paper into a structured asset library; the (b)Planner aligns
text-visual pairs into a binary-tree layout that preserves reading order and
spatial balance; and the (c)Painter-Commenter loop refines each panel by
executing rendering code and using VLM feedback to eliminate overflow and
ensure alignment. In our comprehensive evaluation, we find that GPT-4o
outputs-though visually appealing at first glance-often exhibit noisy text and
poor PaperQuiz scores, and we find that reader engagement is the primary
aesthetic bottleneck, as human-designed posters rely largely on visual
semantics to convey meaning. Our fully open-source variants (e.g. based on the
Qwen-2.5 series) outperform existing 4o-driven multi-agent systems across
nearly all metrics, while using 87% fewer tokens. It transforms a 22-page paper
into a finalized yet editable .pptx poster - all for just $0.005. These
findings chart clear directions for the next generation of fully automated
poster-generation models. The code and datasets are available at

## AI 摘要

本研究提出了首个学术海报生成基准和评估指标（包括视觉质量、文本连贯性、综合评估和论文问答能力），并开发了PosterAgent多智能体流程。该系统通过解析器提取论文结构、规划器设计布局、画匠-评论员循环优化内容，将22页论文转化为可编辑.pptx海报（成本仅0.005美元）。实验表明，开源模型（如Qwen-2.5）在多数指标上优于GPT-4o方案（节省87%token），但人类设计的海报在视觉语义传达上仍具优势。研究为自动化海报生成提供了明确方向，相关代码和数据集已开源。
