# WebDancer: Towards Autonomous Information Seeking Agency

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22648v1

## 原始摘要

Addressing intricate real-world problems necessitates in-depth information
seeking and multi-step reasoning. Recent progress in agentic systems,
exemplified by Deep Research, underscores the potential for autonomous
multi-step research. In this work, we present a cohesive paradigm for building
end-to-end agentic information seeking agents from a data-centric and
training-stage perspective. Our approach consists of four key stages: (1)
browsing data construction, (2) trajectories sampling, (3) supervised
fine-tuning for effective cold start, and (4) reinforcement learning for
enhanced generalisation. We instantiate this framework in a web agent based on
the ReAct, WebDancer. Empirical evaluations on the challenging information
seeking benchmarks, GAIA and WebWalkerQA, demonstrate the strong performance of
WebDancer, achieving considerable results and highlighting the efficacy of our
training paradigm. Further analysis of agent training provides valuable
insights and actionable, systematic pathways for developing more capable
agentic models. The codes and demo will be released in
https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/WebAgent.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种端到端自主信息检索智能体的构建范式，包含四个关键阶段：(1) 浏览数据构建，(2) 轨迹采样，(3) 监督微调实现有效冷启动，(4) 强化学习提升泛化能力。基于ReAct框架实现的WebDancer智能体在GAIA和WebWalkerQA等复杂信息检索基准测试中表现优异。该训练范式为开发更强大的自主智能体提供了系统化路径和实用见解。相关代码和演示将在GitHub开源。
