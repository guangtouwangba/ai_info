# Evaluating AI cyber capabilities with crowdsourced elicitation

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19915v2

## 原始摘要

As AI systems become increasingly capable, understanding their offensive
cyber potential is critical for informed governance and responsible deployment.
However, it's hard to accurately bound their capabilities, and some prior
evaluations dramatically underestimated them. The art of extracting maximum
task-specific performance from AIs is called "AI elicitation", and today's
safety organizations typically conduct it in-house. In this paper, we explore
crowdsourcing elicitation efforts as an alternative to in-house elicitation
work.
  We host open-access AI tracks at two Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions: AI
vs. Humans (400 teams) and Cyber Apocalypse (8000 teams). The AI teams achieve
outstanding performance at both events, ranking top-5% and top-10% respectively
for a total of \$7500 in bounties. This impressive performance suggests that
open-market elicitation may offer an effective complement to in-house
elicitation. We propose elicitation bounties as a practical mechanism for
maintaining timely, cost-effective situational awareness of emerging AI
capabilities.
  Another advantage of open elicitations is the option to collect human
performance data at scale. Applying METR's methodology, we found that AI agents
can reliably solve cyber challenges requiring one hour or less of effort from a
median human CTF participant.


## AI 摘要

随着AI系统能力不断提升，评估其网络攻击潜力对治理和部署至关重要。本研究通过在两场网络安全夺旗赛（CTF）中设立公开AI赛道（400和8000支团队参与），发现AI团队表现优异（前5%和前10%），共获7500美元奖金，表明众包式能力激发可作为内部评估的有效补充。研究提出"AI能力悬赏"机制，以经济高效地追踪AI技术进展。通过METR方法分析发现，AI能可靠解决中位人类选手1小时内完成的网络挑战。开放评估还能大规模收集人类表现数据，为能力对标提供依据。（100字）
