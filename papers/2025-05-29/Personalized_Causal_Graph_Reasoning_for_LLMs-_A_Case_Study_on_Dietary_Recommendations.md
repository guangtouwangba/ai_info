# Personalized Causal Graph Reasoning for LLMs: A Case Study on Dietary Recommendations

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00134v2

## 原始摘要

Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively leverage common-sense knowledge for
general reasoning, yet they struggle with personalized reasoning when tasked
with interpreting multifactor personal data. This limitation restricts their
applicability in domains that require context-aware decision-making tailored to
individuals. This paper introduces Personalized Causal Graph Reasoning as an
agentic framework that enhances LLM reasoning by incorporating personal causal
graphs derived from data of individuals. These graphs provide a foundation that
guides the LLM's reasoning process. We evaluate it on a case study on
nutrient-oriented dietary recommendations, which requires personal reasoning
due to the implicit unique dietary effects. We propose a counterfactual
evaluation to estimate the efficiency of LLM-recommended foods for glucose
management. Results demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently provides
personalized dietary recommendations to reduce average glucose iAUC across
three time windows, which outperforms the previous approach. LLM-as-a-judge
evaluation results indicate that our proposed method enhances personalization
in the reasoning process.


## AI 摘要

该研究提出了一种基于个性化因果图推理的智能框架，以增强大语言模型（LLMs）在个性化推理中的表现。传统LLMs擅长常识推理，但在处理多因素个人数据时存在局限。该框架通过构建个人因果图来指导LLM的推理过程，并以营养导向的饮食建议为案例进行验证。反事实评估显示，该方法能有效推荐有助于血糖管理的个性化饮食方案，在三个时间窗口内降低平均葡萄糖iAUC，效果优于先前方法。LLM作为评判的评估结果也证实了该方法提升了推理过程的个性化程度。
