# Personalized Causal Graph Reasoning for LLMs: A Case Study on Dietary Recommendations

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00134v2

## 原始摘要

Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively leverage common-sense knowledge for
general reasoning, yet they struggle with personalized reasoning when tasked
with interpreting multifactor personal data. This limitation restricts their
applicability in domains that require context-aware decision-making tailored to
individuals. This paper introduces Personalized Causal Graph Reasoning as an
agentic framework that enhances LLM reasoning by incorporating personal causal
graphs derived from data of individuals. These graphs provide a foundation that
guides the LLM's reasoning process. We evaluate it on a case study on
nutrient-oriented dietary recommendations, which requires personal reasoning
due to the implicit unique dietary effects. We propose a counterfactual
evaluation to estimate the efficiency of LLM-recommended foods for glucose
management. Results demonstrate that the proposed method efficiently provides
personalized dietary recommendations to reduce average glucose iAUC across
three time windows, which outperforms the previous approach. LLM-as-a-judge
evaluation results indicate that our proposed method enhances personalization
in the reasoning process.


## AI 摘要

大语言模型（LLMs）擅长常识推理，但在处理个性化多因素数据时表现不足。本文提出个性化因果图推理框架，通过整合个人数据构建因果图来增强LLM的推理能力。以营养饮食推荐为例，该方法能针对个体独特饮食效应进行推理。反事实评估显示，该框架能有效推荐控糖食物，在三个时间窗口内降低平均葡萄糖iAUC，优于传统方法。LLM作为评判者的评估也证实了该方法提升了推理过程的个性化水平。研究成果为需要个性化决策的领域提供了新思路。（99字）
