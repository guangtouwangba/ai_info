# Position: Uncertainty Quantification Needs Reassessment for Large-language Model Agents

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22655v1

## 原始摘要

Large-language models (LLMs) and chatbot agents are known to provide wrong
outputs at times, and it was recently found that this can never be fully
prevented. Hence, uncertainty quantification plays a crucial role, aiming to
quantify the level of ambiguity in either one overall number or two numbers for
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. This position paper argues that this
traditional dichotomy of uncertainties is too limited for the open and
interactive setup that LLM agents operate in when communicating with a user,
and that we need to research avenues that enrich uncertainties in this novel
scenario. We review the literature and find that popular definitions of
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties directly contradict each other and lose
their meaning in interactive LLM agent settings. Hence, we propose three novel
research directions that focus on uncertainties in such human-computer
interactions: Underspecification uncertainties, for when users do not provide
all information or define the exact task at the first go, interactive learning,
to ask follow-up questions and reduce the uncertainty about the current
context, and output uncertainties, to utilize the rich language and speech
space to express uncertainties as more than mere numbers. We expect that these
new ways of dealing with and communicating uncertainties will lead to LLM agent
interactions that are more transparent, trustworthy, and intuitive.


## AI 摘要

这篇立场论文指出，传统将不确定性分为偶然性和认知性的二分法在大型语言模型(LLM)与用户的交互场景中存在局限。作者发现现有定义在交互环境中相互矛盾且失去意义，因此提出三个新研究方向：1)未明确性不确定性(用户初始信息不完整)、2)交互学习(通过追问减少不确定性)、3)输出不确定性(利用丰富语言表达不确定性)。这些新方法旨在使LLM交互更透明、可信和直观，超越传统的数值化不确定性量化方式。研究强调需要针对开放式交互场景开发更丰富的不确定性表达框架。
