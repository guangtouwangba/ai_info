# Position: Uncertainty Quantification Needs Reassessment for Large-language Model Agents

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22655v1

## 原始摘要

Large-language models (LLMs) and chatbot agents are known to provide wrong
outputs at times, and it was recently found that this can never be fully
prevented. Hence, uncertainty quantification plays a crucial role, aiming to
quantify the level of ambiguity in either one overall number or two numbers for
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. This position paper argues that this
traditional dichotomy of uncertainties is too limited for the open and
interactive setup that LLM agents operate in when communicating with a user,
and that we need to research avenues that enrich uncertainties in this novel
scenario. We review the literature and find that popular definitions of
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties directly contradict each other and lose
their meaning in interactive LLM agent settings. Hence, we propose three novel
research directions that focus on uncertainties in such human-computer
interactions: Underspecification uncertainties, for when users do not provide
all information or define the exact task at the first go, interactive learning,
to ask follow-up questions and reduce the uncertainty about the current
context, and output uncertainties, to utilize the rich language and speech
space to express uncertainties as more than mere numbers. We expect that these
new ways of dealing with and communicating uncertainties will lead to LLM agent
interactions that are more transparent, trustworthy, and intuitive.

该立场论文指出，传统将不确定性分为偶然性和认知性的二分法在LLM与用户的开放式交互中存在局限。研究发现，现有定义在交互场景下相互矛盾且失去意义，因此提出三个新研究方向：1) **任务模糊性**（用户未提供完整信息）；2) **交互学习**（通过追问降低上下文不确定性）；3) **输出表达**（用丰富语言而非数字传递不确定性）。这些方法旨在增强LLM交互的透明度、可信度与直观性，以应对模型输出不可靠的核心挑战。（98字）
