# Tissue-specific predictive performance: A unified estimation and inference framework for multi-category screening tests

## 原始摘要

Multi-Cancer Early Detection (MCED) testing with tissue localization aims to
detect and identify multiple cancer types from a single blood sample. Such
tests have the potential to aid clinical decisions and significantly improve
health outcomes. Despite this promise, MCED testing has not yet achieved
regulatory approval, reimbursement or broad clinical adoption. One major reason
for this shortcoming is uncertainty about test performance resulting from the
reporting of clinically obtuse metrics. Traditionally, MCED tests report
aggregate measures of test performance, disregarding cancer type, that obscure
biological variability and underlying differences in the test's behavior,
limiting insight into true effectiveness. Clinically informative evaluation of
an MCED test's performance requires metrics that are specific to cancer types.
In the context of a case-control sampling design, this paper derives analytical
methods that estimate cancer-specific intrinsic accuracy, tissue localization
readout-specific predictive value and the marginal test classification
distribution, each with corresponding confidence interval formulae. A
simulation study is presented that evaluates performance of the proposed
methodology and provides guidance for implementation. An application to a
published MCED test dataset is given. These statistical approaches allow for
estimation and inference for the pointed metric of an MCED test that allow its
evaluation to support a potential role in early cancer detection. This
framework enables more precise clinical decision-making, supports optimized
trial designs across classical, digital, AI-driven, and hybrid stratified
diagnostic screening platforms, and facilitates informed healthcare decisions
by clinicians, policymakers, regulators, scientists, and patients.


## AI 摘要

多癌早期检测(MCED)技术通过单次血液检测实现多种癌症筛查和定位，但目前面临临床推广障碍，主要原因是传统评估指标过于笼统，无法反映不同癌症类型的检测性能差异。本研究提出了一套统计方法，可计算癌症特异性准确率、组织定位预测值等针对性指标，并提供置信区间。通过模拟实验验证方法有效性后，将其应用于真实MCED检测数据。该框架能更精确评估检测性能，支持优化临床试验设计（包括传统、数字、AI驱动等筛查平台），为临床决策者、监管机构和患者提供更可靠的评估依据，促进MCED技术的临床应用。
