# Silence is Not Consensus: Disrupting Agreement Bias in Multi-Agent LLMs via Catfish Agent for Clinical Decision Making

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21503v1

## 原始摘要

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential in clinical
question answering, with recent multi-agent frameworks further improving
diagnostic accuracy via collaborative reasoning. However, we identify a
recurring issue of Silent Agreement, where agents prematurely converge on
diagnoses without sufficient critical analysis, particularly in complex or
ambiguous cases. We present a new concept called Catfish Agent, a
role-specialized LLM designed to inject structured dissent and counter silent
agreement. Inspired by the ``catfish effect'' in organizational psychology, the
Catfish Agent is designed to challenge emerging consensus to stimulate deeper
reasoning. We formulate two mechanisms to encourage effective and context-aware
interventions: (i) a complexity-aware intervention that modulates agent
engagement based on case difficulty, and (ii) a tone-calibrated intervention
articulated to balance critique and collaboration. Evaluations on nine medical
Q&amp;A and three medical VQA benchmarks show that our approach consistently
outperforms both single- and multi-agent LLMs frameworks, including leading
commercial models such as GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1.


## AI 摘要

研究发现，在多智能体临床问答系统中，语言模型常出现"沉默共识"问题，即过早达成诊断结论而缺乏深入分析。为此，研究者提出"鲶鱼代理"概念，通过引入结构化异议来打破共识僵局。该代理采用两种干预机制：基于病例难度的复杂度感知干预，以及平衡批评与合作的语气校准干预。在12个医疗问答基准测试中，该方法表现优于单智能体和多智能体框架，包括GPT-4o等主流商业模型。这一创新借鉴了组织心理学中的"鲶鱼效应"，有效提升了复杂病例的诊断准确性。
