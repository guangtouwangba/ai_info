# LabUtopia: High-Fidelity Simulation and Hierarchical Benchmark for Scientific Embodied Agents

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22634v1

## 原始摘要

Scientific embodied agents play a crucial role in modern laboratories by
automating complex experimental workflows. Compared to typical household
environments, laboratory settings impose significantly higher demands on
perception of physical-chemical transformations and long-horizon planning,
making them an ideal testbed for advancing embodied intelligence. However, its
development has been long hampered by the lack of suitable simulator and
benchmarks. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing LabUtopia, a
comprehensive simulation and benchmarking suite designed to facilitate the
development of generalizable, reasoning-capable embodied agents in laboratory
settings. Specifically, it integrates i) LabSim, a high-fidelity simulator
supporting multi-physics and chemically meaningful interactions; ii) LabScene,
a scalable procedural generator for diverse scientific scenes; and iii)
LabBench, a hierarchical benchmark spanning five levels of complexity from
atomic actions to long-horizon mobile manipulation. LabUtopia supports 30
distinct tasks and includes more than 200 scene and instrument assets, enabling
large-scale training and principled evaluation in high-complexity environments.
We demonstrate that LabUtopia offers a powerful platform for advancing the
integration of perception, planning, and control in scientific-purpose agents
and provides a rigorous testbed for exploring the practical capabilities and
generalization limits of embodied intelligence in future research.
