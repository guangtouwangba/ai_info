# Applying LLM-Powered Virtual Humans to Child Interviews in Child-Centered Design

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20016v1

## 原始摘要

In child-centered design, directly engaging children is crucial for deeply
understanding their experiences. However, current research often prioritizes
adult perspectives, as interviewing children involves unique challenges such as
environmental sensitivities and the need for trust-building. AI-powered virtual
humans (VHs) offer a promising approach to facilitate engaging and multimodal
interactions with children. This study establishes key design guidelines for
LLM-powered virtual humans tailored to child interviews, standardizing
multimodal elements including color schemes, voice characteristics, facial
features, expressions, head movements, and gestures. Using ChatGPT-based prompt
engineering, we developed three distinct Human-AI workflows (LLM-Auto,
LLM-Interview, and LLM-Analyze) and conducted a user study involving 15
children aged 6 to 12. The results indicated that the LLM-Analyze workflow
outperformed the others by eliciting longer responses, achieving higher user
experience ratings, and promoting more effective child engagement.


## AI 摘要

在儿童中心设计中，直接与儿童互动对理解其体验至关重要，但现有研究常以成人视角为主。AI虚拟人（VHs）为儿童访谈提供了创新解决方案，通过多模态交互（如色彩、语音、表情和动作）增强参与度。本研究基于ChatGPT开发了三种人机协作流程（LLM-Auto、LLM-Interview和LLM-Analyze），并对6-12岁儿童测试。结果显示，LLM-Analyze流程表现最优，能获得更长的回答、更高的用户体验评分和更有效的儿童参与。研究为儿童访谈的AI虚拟人设计提供了标准化指导。
