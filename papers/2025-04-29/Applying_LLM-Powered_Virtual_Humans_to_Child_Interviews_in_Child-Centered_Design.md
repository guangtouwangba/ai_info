# Applying LLM-Powered Virtual Humans to Child Interviews in Child-Centered Design

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20016v1

## 原始摘要

In child-centered design, directly engaging children is crucial for deeply
understanding their experiences. However, current research often prioritizes
adult perspectives, as interviewing children involves unique challenges such as
environmental sensitivities and the need for trust-building. AI-powered virtual
humans (VHs) offer a promising approach to facilitate engaging and multimodal
interactions with children. This study establishes key design guidelines for
LLM-powered virtual humans tailored to child interviews, standardizing
multimodal elements including color schemes, voice characteristics, facial
features, expressions, head movements, and gestures. Using ChatGPT-based prompt
engineering, we developed three distinct Human-AI workflows (LLM-Auto,
LLM-Interview, and LLM-Analyze) and conducted a user study involving 15
children aged 6 to 12. The results indicated that the LLM-Analyze workflow
outperformed the others by eliciting longer responses, achieving higher user
experience ratings, and promoting more effective child engagement.


## AI 摘要

在儿童中心设计中，直接与儿童互动对理解其体验至关重要，但现有研究常以成人视角为主。AI虚拟人(VHs)为解决儿童访谈中的信任建立和环境敏感性问题提供了新思路。本研究制定了基于大语言模型(LLM)的儿童访谈虚拟人设计指南，规范了色彩、语音、表情等交互要素。通过ChatGPT提示工程开发了三种人机协作模式(LLM-Auto/Interview/Analyze)，对15名6-12岁儿童的测试表明，LLM-Analyze模式能获得更长的回答、更高的用户体验评分和最有效的儿童参与度。
