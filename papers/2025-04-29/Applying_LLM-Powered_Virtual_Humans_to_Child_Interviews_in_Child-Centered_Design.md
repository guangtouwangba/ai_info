# Applying LLM-Powered Virtual Humans to Child Interviews in Child-Centered Design

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20016v1

## 原始摘要

In child-centered design, directly engaging children is crucial for deeply
understanding their experiences. However, current research often prioritizes
adult perspectives, as interviewing children involves unique challenges such as
environmental sensitivities and the need for trust-building. AI-powered virtual
humans (VHs) offer a promising approach to facilitate engaging and multimodal
interactions with children. This study establishes key design guidelines for
LLM-powered virtual humans tailored to child interviews, standardizing
multimodal elements including color schemes, voice characteristics, facial
features, expressions, head movements, and gestures. Using ChatGPT-based prompt
engineering, we developed three distinct Human-AI workflows (LLM-Auto,
LLM-Interview, and LLM-Analyze) and conducted a user study involving 15
children aged 6 to 12. The results indicated that the LLM-Analyze workflow
outperformed the others by eliciting longer responses, achieving higher user
experience ratings, and promoting more effective child engagement.


## AI 摘要

这项研究探讨了AI虚拟人(VHs)在儿童访谈中的应用，通过ChatGPT提示工程开发了三种人机交互工作流(LLM-Auto、LLM-Interview和LLM-Analyze)。研究制定了针对儿童访谈的虚拟人设计指南，规范了色彩、语音、面部特征等要素。对15名6-12岁儿童的测试显示，LLM-Analyze工作流表现最佳，能获得更长的回答、更高的用户体验评分和更有效的儿童参与度。研究表明，基于大语言模型的虚拟人可克服传统儿童访谈的挑战，如环境敏感性和信任建立问题，为儿童中心设计提供了新方法。
