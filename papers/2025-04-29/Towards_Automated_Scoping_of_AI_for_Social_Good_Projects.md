# Towards Automated Scoping of AI for Social Good Projects

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20010v1

## 原始摘要

Artificial Intelligence for Social Good (AI4SG) is an emerging effort that
aims to address complex societal challenges with the powerful capabilities of
AI systems. These challenges range from local issues with transit networks to
global wildlife preservation. However, regardless of scale, a critical
bottleneck for many AI4SG initiatives is the laborious process of problem
scoping -- a complex and resource-intensive task -- due to a scarcity of
professionals with both technical and domain expertise. Given the remarkable
applications of large language models (LLM), we propose a Problem Scoping Agent
(PSA) that uses an LLM to generate comprehensive project proposals grounded in
scientific literature and real-world knowledge. We demonstrate that our PSA
framework generates proposals comparable to those written by experts through a
blind review and AI evaluations. Finally, we document the challenges of
real-world problem scoping and note several areas for future work.


## AI 摘要

"AI for Social Good (AI4SG) 旨在利用AI解决复杂社会问题，但项目规划阶段常因缺乏跨领域专家而困难。为此，研究者提出基于大语言模型(LLM)的"问题规划代理"(PSA)，能自动生成基于科学文献和实际知识的项目提案。经专家盲审和AI评估，PSA生成的提案质量接近专家水平。研究还记录了现实问题规划中的挑战，并指出未来改进方向。该框架有望降低AI4SG项目的启动门槛，促进社会问题的AI解决方案开发。" (98字) 

核心要点：
1. AI4SG面临规划难题
2. 提出LLM驱动的PSA解决方案
3. 验证提案质量接近专家水平
4. 指出实际应用挑战和未来方向
