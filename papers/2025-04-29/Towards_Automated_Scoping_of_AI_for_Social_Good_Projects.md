# Towards Automated Scoping of AI for Social Good Projects

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20010v1

## 原始摘要

Artificial Intelligence for Social Good (AI4SG) is an emerging effort that
aims to address complex societal challenges with the powerful capabilities of
AI systems. These challenges range from local issues with transit networks to
global wildlife preservation. However, regardless of scale, a critical
bottleneck for many AI4SG initiatives is the laborious process of problem
scoping -- a complex and resource-intensive task -- due to a scarcity of
professionals with both technical and domain expertise. Given the remarkable
applications of large language models (LLM), we propose a Problem Scoping Agent
(PSA) that uses an LLM to generate comprehensive project proposals grounded in
scientific literature and real-world knowledge. We demonstrate that our PSA
framework generates proposals comparable to those written by experts through a
blind review and AI evaluations. Finally, we document the challenges of
real-world problem scoping and note several areas for future work.


## AI 摘要

AI4SG（人工智能促进社会公益）利用AI技术解决复杂社会问题，如交通网络优化和全球野生动物保护。然而，项目规划（问题界定）常因缺乏兼具技术和领域知识的专家而成为瓶颈。为此，研究者提出基于大语言模型（LLM）的"问题界定代理"（PSA），通过整合科学文献和现实知识生成全面项目提案。实验表明，PSA生成的提案质量接近专家水平。研究还揭示了现实问题界定中的挑战，并指出未来改进方向。该框架为降低AI4SG项目启动门槛提供了新思路。
