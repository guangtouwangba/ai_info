# Towards Automated Scoping of AI for Social Good Projects

## 原始摘要

Artificial Intelligence for Social Good (AI4SG) is an emerging effort that
aims to address complex societal challenges with the powerful capabilities of
AI systems. These challenges range from local issues with transit networks to
global wildlife preservation. However, regardless of scale, a critical
bottleneck for many AI4SG initiatives is the laborious process of problem
scoping -- a complex and resource-intensive task -- due to a scarcity of
professionals with both technical and domain expertise. Given the remarkable
applications of large language models (LLM), we propose a Problem Scoping Agent
(PSA) that uses an LLM to generate comprehensive project proposals grounded in
scientific literature and real-world knowledge. We demonstrate that our PSA
framework generates proposals comparable to those written by experts through a
blind review and AI evaluations. Finally, we document the challenges of
real-world problem scoping and note several areas for future work.


## AI 摘要

AI for Social Good (AI4SG) 利用AI技术解决社会问题，但项目规划常因技术-领域复合型人才短缺而受阻。研究提出基于大语言模型(LLM)的"问题规划代理"(PSA)，通过整合科学文献和现实知识自动生成项目提案。经专家盲审和AI评估，PSA生成的提案质量接近专家水平。研究同时指出了实际应用中的挑战和未来改进方向。该框架为降低AI4SG项目启动门槛提供了新思路。（99字）
