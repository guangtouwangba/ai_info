# Modular Machine Learning: An Indispensable Path towards New-Generation Large Language Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20020v1

## 原始摘要

Large language models (LLMs) have dramatically advanced machine learning
research including natural language processing, computer vision, data mining,
etc., yet they still exhibit critical limitations in reasoning, factual
consistency, and interpretability. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning
paradigm -- Modular Machine Learning (MML) -- as an essential approach toward
new-generation LLMs. MML decomposes the complex structure of LLMs into three
interdependent components: modular representation, modular model, and modular
reasoning, aiming to enhance LLMs' capability of counterfactual reasoning,
mitigating hallucinations, as well as promoting fairness, safety, and
transparency. Specifically, the proposed MML paradigm can: i) clarify the
internal working mechanism of LLMs through the disentanglement of semantic
components; ii) allow for flexible and task-adaptive model design; iii) enable
interpretable and logic-driven decision-making process. We present a feasible
implementation of MML-based LLMs via leveraging advanced techniques such as
disentangled representation learning, neural architecture search and
neuro-symbolic learning. We critically identify key challenges, such as the
integration of continuous neural and discrete symbolic processes, joint
optimization, and computational scalability, present promising future research
directions that deserve further exploration. Ultimately, the integration of the
MML paradigm with LLMs has the potential to bridge the gap between statistical
(deep) learning and formal (logical) reasoning, thereby paving the way for
robust, adaptable, and trustworthy AI systems across a wide range of real-world
applications.


## AI 摘要

该论文提出了一种新型学习范式——模块化机器学习（MML），旨在解决大语言模型（LLMs）在推理、事实一致性和可解释性方面的局限性。MML将LLMs分解为模块化表示、模块化模型和模块化推理三个相互依赖的组件，以增强反事实推理能力、减少幻觉问题，并提升公平性、安全性和透明度。MML通过解耦语义组件、支持灵活的任务自适应设计，以及实现可解释的逻辑驱动决策，优化LLMs的内部机制。研究还探讨了神经符号学习等技术实现MML的可行性，并指出了未来研究方向，如神经与符号过程的整合及计算可扩展性。
