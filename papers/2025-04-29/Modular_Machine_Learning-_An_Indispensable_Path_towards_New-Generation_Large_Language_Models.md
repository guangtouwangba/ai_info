# Modular Machine Learning: An Indispensable Path towards New-Generation Large Language Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20020v1

## 原始摘要

Large language models (LLMs) have dramatically advanced machine learning
research including natural language processing, computer vision, data mining,
etc., yet they still exhibit critical limitations in reasoning, factual
consistency, and interpretability. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning
paradigm -- Modular Machine Learning (MML) -- as an essential approach toward
new-generation LLMs. MML decomposes the complex structure of LLMs into three
interdependent components: modular representation, modular model, and modular
reasoning, aiming to enhance LLMs' capability of counterfactual reasoning,
mitigating hallucinations, as well as promoting fairness, safety, and
transparency. Specifically, the proposed MML paradigm can: i) clarify the
internal working mechanism of LLMs through the disentanglement of semantic
components; ii) allow for flexible and task-adaptive model design; iii) enable
interpretable and logic-driven decision-making process. We present a feasible
implementation of MML-based LLMs via leveraging advanced techniques such as
disentangled representation learning, neural architecture search and
neuro-symbolic learning. We critically identify key challenges, such as the
integration of continuous neural and discrete symbolic processes, joint
optimization, and computational scalability, present promising future research
directions that deserve further exploration. Ultimately, the integration of the
MML paradigm with LLMs has the potential to bridge the gap between statistical
(deep) learning and formal (logical) reasoning, thereby paving the way for
robust, adaptable, and trustworthy AI systems across a wide range of real-world
applications.


## AI 摘要

本文提出模块化机器学习（MML）作为新一代大语言模型（LLM）的发展方向。MML将LLM分解为模块化表示、模型和推理三个相互关联的组件，旨在提升反事实推理能力、减少幻觉问题，并增强公平性、安全性和可解释性。MML通过解耦语义组件阐明LLM内部机制，支持灵活的任务自适应设计，实现逻辑驱动的决策过程。研究结合解耦表示学习、神经架构搜索和神经符号学习等技术实现MML，并指出神经与符号系统融合、联合优化和计算扩展等关键挑战。MML有望连接统计学习与逻辑推理，推动构建更鲁棒、可信的AI系统。
