# Modular Machine Learning: An Indispensable Path towards New-Generation Large Language Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20020v1

## 原始摘要

Large language models (LLMs) have dramatically advanced machine learning
research including natural language processing, computer vision, data mining,
etc., yet they still exhibit critical limitations in reasoning, factual
consistency, and interpretability. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning
paradigm -- Modular Machine Learning (MML) -- as an essential approach toward
new-generation LLMs. MML decomposes the complex structure of LLMs into three
interdependent components: modular representation, modular model, and modular
reasoning, aiming to enhance LLMs' capability of counterfactual reasoning,
mitigating hallucinations, as well as promoting fairness, safety, and
transparency. Specifically, the proposed MML paradigm can: i) clarify the
internal working mechanism of LLMs through the disentanglement of semantic
components; ii) allow for flexible and task-adaptive model design; iii) enable
interpretable and logic-driven decision-making process. We present a feasible
implementation of MML-based LLMs via leveraging advanced techniques such as
disentangled representation learning, neural architecture search and
neuro-symbolic learning. We critically identify key challenges, such as the
integration of continuous neural and discrete symbolic processes, joint
optimization, and computational scalability, present promising future research
directions that deserve further exploration. Ultimately, the integration of the
MML paradigm with LLMs has the potential to bridge the gap between statistical
(deep) learning and formal (logical) reasoning, thereby paving the way for
robust, adaptable, and trustworthy AI systems across a wide range of real-world
applications.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种新型学习范式——模块化机器学习（MML），旨在解决大语言模型（LLM）在推理、事实一致性和可解释性方面的局限性。MML将LLM分解为模块化表征、模块化模型和模块化推理三个相互依赖的组件，以增强反事实推理能力、减少幻觉，并提升公平性、安全性和透明度。该范式通过解耦语义组件阐明LLM内部机制，支持灵活的任务自适应设计，实现可解释的逻辑驱动决策。研究探讨了基于解耦表征学习、神经架构搜索和神经符号学习的技术实现，并指出神经与符号过程融合、联合优化等关键挑战，为构建鲁棒、可信的AI系统提供了新方向。（100字）
