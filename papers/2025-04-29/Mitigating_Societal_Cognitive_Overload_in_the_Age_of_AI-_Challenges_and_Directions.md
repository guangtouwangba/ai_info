# Mitigating Societal Cognitive Overload in the Age of AI: Challenges and Directions

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19990v1

## 原始摘要

Societal cognitive overload, driven by the deluge of information and
complexity in the AI age, poses a critical challenge to human well-being and
societal resilience. This paper argues that mitigating cognitive overload is
not only essential for improving present-day life but also a crucial
prerequisite for navigating the potential risks of advanced AI, including
existential threats. We examine how AI exacerbates cognitive overload through
various mechanisms, including information proliferation, algorithmic
manipulation, automation anxieties, deregulation, and the erosion of meaning.
The paper reframes the AI safety debate to center on cognitive overload,
highlighting its role as a bridge between near-term harms and long-term risks.
It concludes by discussing potential institutional adaptations, research
directions, and policy considerations that arise from adopting an
overload-resilient perspective on human-AI alignment, suggesting pathways for
future exploration rather than prescribing definitive solutions.


## AI 摘要

在AI时代，信息过载和复杂性加剧了社会认知负荷，威胁人类福祉和社会韧性。本文指出，缓解认知负荷不仅是改善当前生活的关键，也是应对高级AI潜在风险（包括生存威胁）的前提。研究分析了AI通过信息爆炸、算法操控、自动化焦虑、监管缺失和意义消解等机制加剧认知负荷的现象，并将AI安全辩论重新聚焦于认知负荷，强调其连接短期危害与长期风险的桥梁作用。最后探讨了制度适应、研究方向和政策考量，提出从认知负荷韧性视角探索人机对齐的未来路径，而非提供确定解决方案。
