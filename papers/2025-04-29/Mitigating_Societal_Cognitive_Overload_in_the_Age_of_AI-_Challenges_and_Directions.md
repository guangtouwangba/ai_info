# Mitigating Societal Cognitive Overload in the Age of AI: Challenges and Directions

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19990v1

## 原始摘要

Societal cognitive overload, driven by the deluge of information and
complexity in the AI age, poses a critical challenge to human well-being and
societal resilience. This paper argues that mitigating cognitive overload is
not only essential for improving present-day life but also a crucial
prerequisite for navigating the potential risks of advanced AI, including
existential threats. We examine how AI exacerbates cognitive overload through
various mechanisms, including information proliferation, algorithmic
manipulation, automation anxieties, deregulation, and the erosion of meaning.
The paper reframes the AI safety debate to center on cognitive overload,
highlighting its role as a bridge between near-term harms and long-term risks.
It concludes by discussing potential institutional adaptations, research
directions, and policy considerations that arise from adopting an
overload-resilient perspective on human-AI alignment, suggesting pathways for
future exploration rather than prescribing definitive solutions.


## AI 摘要

在AI时代，信息过载和复杂性加剧导致社会认知超载，威胁人类福祉和社会韧性。本文指出，缓解认知超载不仅是改善当前生活的关键，更是应对高级AI潜在风险（包括生存威胁）的前提。研究探讨了AI通过信息泛滥、算法操控、自动化焦虑、监管缺失和意义消解等机制加剧认知超载，并将AI安全辩论重新聚焦于认知超载问题——它连接了短期危害与长期风险。最后提出从"超载韧性"视角探索人机对齐的机构适应、研究方向和政策考量，为未来研究指明路径而非提供确定方案。
