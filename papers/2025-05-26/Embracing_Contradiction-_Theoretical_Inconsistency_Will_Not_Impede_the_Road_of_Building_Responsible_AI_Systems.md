# Embracing Contradiction: Theoretical Inconsistency Will Not Impede the Road of Building Responsible AI Systems

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18139v1

## 原始摘要

This position paper argues that the theoretical inconsistency often observed
among Responsible AI (RAI) metrics, such as differing fairness definitions or
tradeoffs between accuracy and privacy, should be embraced as a valuable
feature rather than a flaw to be eliminated. We contend that navigating these
inconsistencies, by treating metrics as divergent objectives, yields three key
benefits: (1) Normative Pluralism: Maintaining a full suite of potentially
contradictory metrics ensures that the diverse moral stances and stakeholder
values inherent in RAI are adequately represented. (2) Epistemological
Completeness: The use of multiple, sometimes conflicting, metrics allows for a
more comprehensive capture of multifaceted ethical concepts, thereby preserving
greater informational fidelity about these concepts than any single, simplified
definition. (3) Implicit Regularization: Jointly optimizing for theoretically
conflicting objectives discourages overfitting to one specific metric, steering
models towards solutions with enhanced generalization and robustness under
real-world complexities. In contrast, efforts to enforce theoretical
consistency by simplifying or pruning metrics risk narrowing this value
diversity, losing conceptual depth, and degrading model performance. We
therefore advocate for a shift in RAI theory and practice: from getting trapped
in inconsistency to characterizing acceptable inconsistency thresholds and
elucidating the mechanisms that permit robust, approximated consistency in
practice.


## AI 摘要

这篇立场论文主张，负责任人工智能（RAI）指标间的理论不一致性（如公平性定义差异或准确性与隐私的权衡）应被视为优势而非缺陷。作者提出，通过将指标视为不同目标来协调矛盾，能带来三大益处：(1) **规范多元性**：保留矛盾的指标可体现RAI中多样的道德立场和利益相关者价值；(2) **认知完整性**：冲突指标能更全面捕捉复杂的伦理概念；(3) **隐式正则化**：多目标优化可避免过拟合单一指标，提升模型泛化能力。相反，强行统一指标会削弱价值多样性、简化伦理深度并损害模型表现。建议实践应聚焦界定可接受的不一致阈值，而非消除矛盾。
