# Stochastic agent-based Monte Carlo simulations for reaction-diffusion models, population dynamics, and epidemic spreading

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18145v1

## 原始摘要

We provide a succinct overview of the implementation of Monte Carlo
algorithms based on Markovian stochastic dynamics to study interacting and
reacting many-particle systems away from thermal equilibrium. Such agent-based
computer simulations constitute an effective tool to introduce undergraduate
and beginning graduate students to current frontier research without requiring
much prior knowledge or experience: Starting from direct visualization of
simulation data, students may gain immediate insight into emerging macroscopic
features of a complex model system and subsequently apply more sophisticated
data analysis to quantitatively characterize its often rich dynamical
properties, both in stationary and transient regimes. We utilize numerical
investigations of paradigmatic reaction-diffusion systems, as well as
stochastic models for population dynamics and epidemic spreading, to exemplify
how interdisciplinary computational research can be effectively utilized in
bottom-up undergraduate and graduate education through learning by doing. In
addition, we give helpful hints for the practical setup of Monte Carlo
simulation algorithms, provide sample codes, explain some typical data analysis
tools, and describe various potential error sources and pitfalls, with tips for
avoiding them.
