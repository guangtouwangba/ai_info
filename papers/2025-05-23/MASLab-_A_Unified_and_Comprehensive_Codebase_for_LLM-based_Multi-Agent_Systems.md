# MASLab: A Unified and Comprehensive Codebase for LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16988v1

## 原始摘要

LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have demonstrated significant potential
in enhancing single LLMs to address complex and diverse tasks in practical
applications. Despite considerable advancements, the field lacks a unified
codebase that consolidates existing methods, resulting in redundant
re-implementation efforts, unfair comparisons, and high entry barriers for
researchers. To address these challenges, we introduce MASLab, a unified,
comprehensive, and research-friendly codebase for LLM-based MAS. (1) MASLab
integrates over 20 established methods across multiple domains, each rigorously
validated by comparing step-by-step outputs with its official implementation.
(2) MASLab provides a unified environment with various benchmarks for fair
comparisons among methods, ensuring consistent inputs and standardized
evaluation protocols. (3) MASLab implements methods within a shared streamlined
structure, lowering the barriers for understanding and extension. Building on
MASLab, we conduct extensive experiments covering 10+ benchmarks and 8 models,
offering researchers a clear and comprehensive view of the current landscape of
MAS methods. MASLab will continue to evolve, tracking the latest developments
in the field, and invite contributions from the broader open-source community.


## AI 摘要

研究人员开发了MASLab，一个统一、全面的多智能体系统（MAS）代码库，旨在解决现有LLM-based MAS领域缺乏统一平台导致的冗余开发、不公平比较和研究门槛高等问题。MASLab整合了20多种跨领域已验证方法，提供统一环境与多种基准测试确保公平比较，并采用共享结构降低理解与扩展难度。通过覆盖10+基准测试和8种模型的实验，MASLab为研究者提供了当前MAS方法的全面视图。该平台将持续更新并欢迎开源社区贡献，以跟踪领域最新进展。
