# The Agentic Economy

## 原始摘要

Generative AI has transformed human-computer interaction by enabling natural
language interfaces and the emergence of autonomous agents capable of acting on
users' behalf. While early applications have improved individual productivity,
these gains have largely been confined to predefined tasks within existing
workflows. We argue that the more profound economic impact lies in reducing
communication frictions between consumers and businesses. This shift could
reorganize markets, redistribute power, and catalyze the creation of new
products and services. We explore the implications of an agentic economy, where
assistant agents act on behalf of consumers and service agents represent
businesses, interacting programmatically to facilitate transactions. A key
distinction we draw is between unscripted interactions -- enabled by technical
advances in natural language and protocol design -- and unrestricted
interactions, which depend on market structures and governance. We examine the
current limitations of siloed and end-to-end agents, and explore future
scenarios shaped by technical standards and market dynamics. These include the
potential tension between agentic walled gardens and an open web of agents,
implications for advertising and discovery, the evolution of
micro-transactions, and the unbundling and rebundling of digital goods.
Ultimately, we argue that the architecture of agentic communication will
determine the extent to which generative AI democratizes access to economic
opportunity.


## AI 摘要

生成式AI通过自然语言界面和自主代理改变了人机交互，其经济潜力不仅在于提升个人效率，更在于降低消费者与企业间的沟通成本，可能重组市场结构并催生新服务。未来"代理经济"中，消费者代理与企业代理将通过程序化交互促成交易，其发展取决于技术标准（如自然语言协议）和市场治理。当前局限包括封闭式代理系统与端到端代理的割裂，未来可能形成"代理围墙花园"或开放代理网络，影响广告、微交易和数字商品形态。代理交互架构将决定生成式AI能否真正 democratize 经济机会。
