# Exploring the Innovation Opportunities for Pre-trained Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15790v1

## 原始摘要

Innovators transform the world by understanding where services are
successfully meeting customers' needs and then using this knowledge to identify
failsafe opportunities for innovation. Pre-trained models have changed the AI
innovation landscape, making it faster and easier to create new AI products and
services. Understanding where pre-trained models are successful is critical for
supporting AI innovation. Unfortunately, the hype cycle surrounding pre-trained
models makes it hard to know where AI can really be successful. To address
this, we investigated pre-trained model applications developed by HCI
researchers as a proxy for commercially successful applications. The research
applications demonstrate technical capabilities, address real user needs, and
avoid ethical challenges. Using an artifact analysis approach, we categorized
capabilities, opportunity domains, data types, and emerging interaction design
patterns, uncovering some of the opportunity space for innovation with
pre-trained models.


## AI 摘要

这篇摘要探讨了预训练模型如何改变AI创新格局。研究表明，通过分析人机交互研究者开发的预训练模型应用（这些应用展示了技术能力、满足用户需求且避免伦理问题），可以识别可靠的创新机会。研究者采用人工制品分析方法，对模型能力、应用领域、数据类型和新兴交互设计模式进行分类，揭示了预训练模型的创新潜力空间。这种方法有助于克服当前AI炒作周期带来的认知困难，为判断AI实际应用成功领域提供了新视角，对支持AI创新具有重要意义。
