# Exploring the Innovation Opportunities for Pre-trained Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15790v1

## 原始摘要

Innovators transform the world by understanding where services are
successfully meeting customers' needs and then using this knowledge to identify
failsafe opportunities for innovation. Pre-trained models have changed the AI
innovation landscape, making it faster and easier to create new AI products and
services. Understanding where pre-trained models are successful is critical for
supporting AI innovation. Unfortunately, the hype cycle surrounding pre-trained
models makes it hard to know where AI can really be successful. To address
this, we investigated pre-trained model applications developed by HCI
researchers as a proxy for commercially successful applications. The research
applications demonstrate technical capabilities, address real user needs, and
avoid ethical challenges. Using an artifact analysis approach, we categorized
capabilities, opportunity domains, data types, and emerging interaction design
patterns, uncovering some of the opportunity space for innovation with
pre-trained models.


## AI 摘要

预训练模型正在改变AI创新格局，但市场炒作使其真实应用场景难以判断。研究者通过分析人机交互领域的预训练模型应用案例（因其兼具技术可行性、用户需求满足和伦理规避特性），系统梳理了创新机会空间。研究发现这些应用在技术能力、应用领域、数据类型和交互设计模式等方面展现出明确模式，为识别可靠的AI创新方向提供了实证依据。该研究揭示了预训练模型在满足实际需求时的成功路径，有助于开发者避开炒作陷阱，聚焦真正具有商业潜力的AI产品开发方向。
