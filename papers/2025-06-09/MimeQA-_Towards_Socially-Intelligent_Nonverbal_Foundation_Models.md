# MimeQA: Towards Socially-Intelligent Nonverbal Foundation Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16671v2

## 原始摘要

As AI becomes more closely integrated with peoples' daily activities,
socially intelligent AI that can understand and interact seamlessly with humans
in daily lives is increasingly important. However, current works in AI social
reasoning all rely on language-only or language-dominant approaches to
benchmark and training models, resulting in systems that are improving in
verbal communication but struggle with nonverbal social understanding. To
address this limitation, we tap into a novel data source rich in nonverbal
social interactions -- mime videos. Mimes refer to the art of expression
through gesture and movement without spoken words, which presents unique
challenges and opportunities in interpreting nonverbal social communication. We
contribute a new dataset called MimeQA, obtained by sourcing 8 hours of videos
clips from YouTube and developing a comprehensive video question-answering
benchmark comprising 806 carefully annotated and verified question-answer
pairs, designed to probe nonverbal social reasoning capabilities. Using MimeQA,
we evaluate state-of-the-art video large language models (vLLMs) and find that
they achieve low overall accuracy, ranging from 20-30%, while humans score 86%.
Our analysis reveals that vLLMs often fail to ground imagined objects and
over-rely on the text prompt while ignoring subtle nonverbal interactions. We
hope to inspire future work in AI models that embody true social intelligence
capable of interpreting non-verbal human interactions.


## AI 摘要

当前AI社交推理主要依赖语言处理，导致系统在非语言社交理解方面存在不足。为解决这一问题，研究团队开发了基于哑剧视频的新数据集MimeQA，包含8小时视频片段和806个问答对，专门测试非语言社交推理能力。评估发现，现有视频大语言模型(vLLM)准确率仅20-30%，远低于人类的86%。分析表明，vLLM常无法理解想象物体，过度依赖文本提示而忽视细微的非语言互动。该研究旨在推动AI发展真正的社交智能，使其能准确解读人类的非语言互动行为。
