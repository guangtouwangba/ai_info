# MimeQA: Towards Socially-Intelligent Nonverbal Foundation Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16671v2

## 原始摘要

As AI becomes more closely integrated with peoples' daily activities,
socially intelligent AI that can understand and interact seamlessly with humans
in daily lives is increasingly important. However, current works in AI social
reasoning all rely on language-only or language-dominant approaches to
benchmark and training models, resulting in systems that are improving in
verbal communication but struggle with nonverbal social understanding. To
address this limitation, we tap into a novel data source rich in nonverbal
social interactions -- mime videos. Mimes refer to the art of expression
through gesture and movement without spoken words, which presents unique
challenges and opportunities in interpreting nonverbal social communication. We
contribute a new dataset called MimeQA, obtained by sourcing 8 hours of videos
clips from YouTube and developing a comprehensive video question-answering
benchmark comprising 806 carefully annotated and verified question-answer
pairs, designed to probe nonverbal social reasoning capabilities. Using MimeQA,
we evaluate state-of-the-art video large language models (vLLMs) and find that
they achieve low overall accuracy, ranging from 20-30%, while humans score 86%.
Our analysis reveals that vLLMs often fail to ground imagined objects and
over-rely on the text prompt while ignoring subtle nonverbal interactions. We
hope to inspire future work in AI models that embody true social intelligence
capable of interpreting non-verbal human interactions.


## AI 摘要

当前AI社交推理主要依赖语言处理，导致系统擅长语言交流但缺乏非语言社交理解能力。为突破这一局限，研究团队利用哑剧视频（无语言纯肢体表达）创建了MimeQA数据集，包含8小时YouTube视频和806个标注问答对，专门测试非语言社交推理能力。评估发现，顶尖视频大语言模型(vLLM)准确率仅20-30%，远低于人类的86%。分析显示vLLMs存在两大缺陷：难以理解虚拟物体，过度依赖文本提示而忽略细微非语言互动。该研究为开发真正具备非语言社交智能的AI模型提供了新方向。
