# MimeQA: Towards Socially-Intelligent Nonverbal Foundation Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16671v2

## 原始摘要

As AI becomes more closely integrated with peoples' daily activities,
socially intelligent AI that can understand and interact seamlessly with humans
in daily lives is increasingly important. However, current works in AI social
reasoning all rely on language-only or language-dominant approaches to
benchmark and training models, resulting in systems that are improving in
verbal communication but struggle with nonverbal social understanding. To
address this limitation, we tap into a novel data source rich in nonverbal
social interactions -- mime videos. Mimes refer to the art of expression
through gesture and movement without spoken words, which presents unique
challenges and opportunities in interpreting nonverbal social communication. We
contribute a new dataset called MimeQA, obtained by sourcing 8 hours of videos
clips from YouTube and developing a comprehensive video question-answering
benchmark comprising 806 carefully annotated and verified question-answer
pairs, designed to probe nonverbal social reasoning capabilities. Using MimeQA,
we evaluate state-of-the-art video large language models (vLLMs) and find that
they achieve low overall accuracy, ranging from 20-30%, while humans score 86%.
Our analysis reveals that vLLMs often fail to ground imagined objects and
over-rely on the text prompt while ignoring subtle nonverbal interactions. We
hope to inspire future work in AI models that embody true social intelligence
capable of interpreting non-verbal human interactions.


## AI 摘要

随着AI日益融入日常生活，开发具备社交智能的AI系统变得至关重要。当前AI社交推理研究主要依赖语言模态，导致系统虽擅长语言交流却缺乏非语言社交理解能力。为此，研究者创新性地采用哑剧视频作为非语言交互数据源，构建了包含8小时视频片段和806个标注问答对的MimeQA数据集。测试发现，现有视频大语言模型(vLLM)准确率仅20-30%，远低于人类的86%，主要问题在于难以理解虚拟物体和过度依赖文本提示。该研究为开发真正具备非语言社交理解能力的AI系统开辟了新方向。
