# Teaming in the AI Era: AI-Augmented Frameworks for Forming, Simulating, and Optimizing Human Teams

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05265v2

## 原始摘要

Effective teamwork is essential across diverse domains. During the team
formation stage, a key challenge is forming teams that effectively balance user
preferences with task objectives to enhance overall team satisfaction. In the
team performing stage, maintaining cohesion and engagement is critical for
sustaining high team performance. However, existing computational tools and
algorithms for team optimization often rely on static data inputs, narrow
algorithmic objectives, or solutions tailored for specific contexts, failing to
account for the dynamic interplay of team members personalities, evolving
goals, and changing individual preferences. Therefore, teams may encounter
member dissatisfaction, as purely algorithmic assignments can reduce members
commitment to team goals or experience suboptimal engagement due to the absence
of timely, personalized guidance to help members adjust their behaviors and
interactions as team dynamics evolve. Ultimately, these challenges can lead to
reduced overall team performance. My Ph.D. dissertation aims to develop
AI-augmented team optimization frameworks and practical systems that enhance
team satisfaction, engagement, and performance. First, I propose a team
formation framework that leverages a multi-armed bandit algorithm to
iteratively refine team composition based on user preferences, ensuring
alignment between individual needs and collective team goals to enhance team
satisfaction. Second, I introduce tAIfa (Team AI Feedback Assistant), an
AI-powered system that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to deliver
immediate, personalized feedback to both teams and individual members,
enhancing cohesion and engagement. Finally, I present PuppeteerLLM, an
LLM-based simulation framework that simulates multi-agent teams to model
complex team dynamics within realistic environments, incorporating task-driven
collaboration and long-term coordination.
