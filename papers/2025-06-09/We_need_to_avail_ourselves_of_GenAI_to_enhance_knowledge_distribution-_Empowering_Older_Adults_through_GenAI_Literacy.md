# "We need to avail ourselves of GenAI to enhance knowledge distribution": Empowering Older Adults through GenAI Literacy

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06225v1

## 原始摘要

As generative AI (GenAI) becomes increasingly widespread, it is crucial to
equip users, particularly vulnerable populations such as older adults (65 and
older), with the knowledge to understand its benefits and potential risks.
Older adults often exhibit greater reservations about adopting emerging
technologies and require tailored literacy support. Using a mixed methods
approach, this study examines strategies for delivering GenAI literacy to older
adults through a chatbot named Litti, evaluating its impact on their AI
literacy (knowledge, safety, and ethical use). The quantitative data indicated
a trend toward improved AI literacy, though the results were not statistically
significant. However, qualitative interviews revealed diverse levels of
familiarity with generative AI and a strong desire to learn more. Findings also
show that while Litti provided a positive learning experience, it did not
significantly enhance participants' trust or sense of safety regarding GenAI.
This exploratory case study highlights the challenges and opportunities in
designing AI literacy education for the rapidly growing older adult population.


## AI 摘要

本研究探讨了通过聊天机器人Litti向老年人（65岁及以上）普及生成式AI（GenAI）知识的策略。尽管定量数据显示AI素养（知识、安全和伦理使用）有改善趋势，但结果未达统计学显著性。定性访谈发现，老年人对GenAI的熟悉程度不一，但学习意愿强烈。研究发现，Litti虽提供了积极的学习体验，但未能显著提升参与者对GenAI的信任或安全感。这项探索性案例研究揭示了为快速增长老年人口设计AI素养教育的挑战与机遇，强调需针对该群体提供定制化支持。
