# "We need to avail ourselves of GenAI to enhance knowledge distribution": Empowering Older Adults through GenAI Literacy

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06225v1

## 原始摘要

As generative AI (GenAI) becomes increasingly widespread, it is crucial to
equip users, particularly vulnerable populations such as older adults (65 and
older), with the knowledge to understand its benefits and potential risks.
Older adults often exhibit greater reservations about adopting emerging
technologies and require tailored literacy support. Using a mixed methods
approach, this study examines strategies for delivering GenAI literacy to older
adults through a chatbot named Litti, evaluating its impact on their AI
literacy (knowledge, safety, and ethical use). The quantitative data indicated
a trend toward improved AI literacy, though the results were not statistically
significant. However, qualitative interviews revealed diverse levels of
familiarity with generative AI and a strong desire to learn more. Findings also
show that while Litti provided a positive learning experience, it did not
significantly enhance participants' trust or sense of safety regarding GenAI.
This exploratory case study highlights the challenges and opportunities in
designing AI literacy education for the rapidly growing older adult population.


## AI 摘要

随着生成式AI（GenAI）的普及，针对老年群体（65岁以上）的AI素养教育尤为重要。本研究通过聊天机器人Litti探索面向老年人的GenAI教育策略，采用混合方法评估其对AI知识、安全使用和伦理认知的影响。定量数据显示AI素养有提升趋势但未达显著水平，定性访谈则揭示老年人对GenAI认知差异显著且学习意愿强烈。研究发现，虽然Litti提供了积极的学习体验，但未能显著提升参与者对GenAI的信任或安全感。这项探索性案例研究凸显了为快速增长老年人口设计AI教育的挑战与机遇。（99字）
