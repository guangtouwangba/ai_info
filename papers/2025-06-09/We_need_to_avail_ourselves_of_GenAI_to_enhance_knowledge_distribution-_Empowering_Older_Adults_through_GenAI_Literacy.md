# "We need to avail ourselves of GenAI to enhance knowledge distribution": Empowering Older Adults through GenAI Literacy

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06225v1

## 原始摘要

As generative AI (GenAI) becomes increasingly widespread, it is crucial to
equip users, particularly vulnerable populations such as older adults (65 and
older), with the knowledge to understand its benefits and potential risks.
Older adults often exhibit greater reservations about adopting emerging
technologies and require tailored literacy support. Using a mixed methods
approach, this study examines strategies for delivering GenAI literacy to older
adults through a chatbot named Litti, evaluating its impact on their AI
literacy (knowledge, safety, and ethical use). The quantitative data indicated
a trend toward improved AI literacy, though the results were not statistically
significant. However, qualitative interviews revealed diverse levels of
familiarity with generative AI and a strong desire to learn more. Findings also
show that while Litti provided a positive learning experience, it did not
significantly enhance participants' trust or sense of safety regarding GenAI.
This exploratory case study highlights the challenges and opportunities in
designing AI literacy education for the rapidly growing older adult population.


## AI 摘要

本研究探讨了如何通过聊天机器人Litti向老年人(65岁及以上)普及生成式AI知识。采用混合方法发现，虽然定量数据显示AI素养(知识、安全、伦理)有提升趋势但不显著，定性访谈则显示老年人对生成式AI熟悉度差异大但学习意愿强烈。研究结果表明，Litti提供了良好的学习体验，但未能显著提升参与者对生成式AI的信任或安全感。这项探索性案例研究揭示了为快速增长老年群体设计AI素养教育面临的挑战与机遇，强调需要针对这一特殊群体开发更有效的技术教育方案。
