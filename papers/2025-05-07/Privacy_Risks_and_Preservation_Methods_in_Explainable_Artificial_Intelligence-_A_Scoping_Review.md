# Privacy Risks and Preservation Methods in Explainable Artificial Intelligence: A Scoping Review

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02828v1

## 原始摘要

Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a pillar of
Trustworthy AI and aims to bring transparency in complex models that are opaque
by nature. Despite the benefits of incorporating explanations in models, an
urgent need is found in addressing the privacy concerns of providing this
additional information to end users. In this article, we conduct a scoping
review of existing literature to elicit details on the conflict between privacy
and explainability. Using the standard methodology for scoping review, we
extracted 57 articles from 1,943 studies published from January 2019 to
December 2024. The review addresses 3 research questions to present readers
with more understanding of the topic: (1) what are the privacy risks of
releasing explanations in AI systems? (2) what current methods have researchers
employed to achieve privacy preservation in XAI systems? (3) what constitutes a
privacy preserving explanation? Based on the knowledge synthesized from the
selected studies, we categorize the privacy risks and preservation methods in
XAI and propose the characteristics of privacy preserving explanations to aid
researchers and practitioners in understanding the requirements of XAI that is
privacy compliant. Lastly, we identify the challenges in balancing privacy with
other system desiderata and provide recommendations for achieving privacy
preserving XAI. We expect that this review will shed light on the complex
relationship of privacy and explainability, both being the fundamental
principles of Trustworthy AI.


## AI 摘要

可解释人工智能（XAI）是可信AI的重要支柱，旨在提升复杂模型的透明度。然而，提供解释信息可能引发隐私风险。本文通过文献综述（2019-2024年57篇研究）探讨了三大问题：(1)XAI解释可能泄露敏感数据、模型细节或训练数据特征；(2)现有隐私保护方法包括数据脱敏、差分隐私和联邦学习；(3)隐私保护解释需满足匿名性、最小披露和可控访问等特性。研究归纳了XAI中的隐私风险与保护技术，提出了隐私保护解释的特征，并指出平衡隐私与其他系统需求的挑战。该综述揭示了可信AI中隐私与可解释性这对核心原则的复杂关系。
