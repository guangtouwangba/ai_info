# Privacy Risks and Preservation Methods in Explainable Artificial Intelligence: A Scoping Review

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02828v1

## 原始摘要

Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a pillar of
Trustworthy AI and aims to bring transparency in complex models that are opaque
by nature. Despite the benefits of incorporating explanations in models, an
urgent need is found in addressing the privacy concerns of providing this
additional information to end users. In this article, we conduct a scoping
review of existing literature to elicit details on the conflict between privacy
and explainability. Using the standard methodology for scoping review, we
extracted 57 articles from 1,943 studies published from January 2019 to
December 2024. The review addresses 3 research questions to present readers
with more understanding of the topic: (1) what are the privacy risks of
releasing explanations in AI systems? (2) what current methods have researchers
employed to achieve privacy preservation in XAI systems? (3) what constitutes a
privacy preserving explanation? Based on the knowledge synthesized from the
selected studies, we categorize the privacy risks and preservation methods in
XAI and propose the characteristics of privacy preserving explanations to aid
researchers and practitioners in understanding the requirements of XAI that is
privacy compliant. Lastly, we identify the challenges in balancing privacy with
other system desiderata and provide recommendations for achieving privacy
preserving XAI. We expect that this review will shed light on the complex
relationship of privacy and explainability, both being the fundamental
principles of Trustworthy AI.


## AI 摘要

这篇综述探讨了可解释人工智能(XAI)与隐私保护之间的冲突。研究分析了2019-2024年间1943项研究，筛选出57篇文献，重点回答三个问题：(1)AI系统提供解释时存在的隐私风险；(2)现有隐私保护XAI方法；(3)隐私保护解释的特征。研究对XAI中的隐私风险和防护方法进行了分类，提出了隐私保护解释应具备的特性，以帮助开发符合隐私要求的XAI系统。同时指出了平衡隐私与其他系统需求的挑战，并给出了实现隐私保护XAI的建议。该研究揭示了可信AI两大基本原则——可解释性与隐私之间的复杂关系。
