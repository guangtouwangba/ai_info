# Humans can learn to detect AI-generated texts, or at least learn when they can't

## 原始摘要

This study investigates whether individuals can learn to accurately
discriminate between human-written and AI-produced texts when provided with
immediate feedback, and if they can use this feedback to recalibrate their
self-perceived competence. We also explore the specific criteria individuals
rely upon when making these decisions, focusing on textual style and perceived
readability.
  We used GPT-4o to generate several hundred texts across various genres and
text types comparable to Koditex, a multi-register corpus of human-written
texts. We then presented randomized text pairs to 255 Czech native speakers who
identified which text was human-written and which was AI-generated.
Participants were randomly assigned to two conditions: one receiving immediate
feedback after each trial, the other receiving no feedback until experiment
completion. We recorded accuracy in identification, confidence levels, response
times, and judgments about text readability along with demographic data and
participants' engagement with AI technologies prior to the experiment.
  Participants receiving immediate feedback showed significant improvement in
accuracy and confidence calibration. Participants initially held incorrect
assumptions about AI-generated text features, including expectations about
stylistic rigidity and readability. Notably, without feedback, participants
made the most errors precisely when feeling most confident -- an issue largely
resolved among the feedback group.
  The ability to differentiate between human and AI-generated texts can be
effectively learned through targeted training with explicit feedback, which
helps correct misconceptions about AI stylistic features and readability, as
well as potential other variables that were not explored, while facilitating
more accurate self-assessment. This finding might be particularly important in
educational contexts.


## AI 摘要

这项研究表明，通过即时反馈训练，人们可以学会更准确地区分人类写作和AI生成的文本，并改善自我能力评估。实验让255名捷克母语者判断随机文本对的来源，其中反馈组在每次尝试后获得正确答案。结果显示，反馈组在识别准确性和信心校准上显著提升，而未反馈组在最有信心时反而错误最多。参与者最初对AI文本风格和可读性存在误解，但反馈帮助纠正了这些错误认知。这一发现对教育领域尤为重要，说明针对性训练能有效提升人类识别AI文本的能力和自我评估准确性。（99字）
