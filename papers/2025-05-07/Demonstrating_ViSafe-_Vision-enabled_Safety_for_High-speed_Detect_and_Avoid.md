# Demonstrating ViSafe: Vision-enabled Safety for High-speed Detect and Avoid

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03694v1

## 原始摘要

Assured safe-separation is essential for achieving seamless high-density
operation of airborne vehicles in a shared airspace. To equip
resource-constrained aerial systems with this safety-critical capability, we
present ViSafe, a high-speed vision-only airborne collision avoidance system.
ViSafe offers a full-stack solution to the Detect and Avoid (DAA) problem by
tightly integrating a learning-based edge-AI framework with a custom
multi-camera hardware prototype designed under SWaP-C constraints. By
leveraging perceptual input-focused control barrier functions (CBF) to design,
encode, and enforce safety thresholds, ViSafe can provide provably safe runtime
guarantees for self-separation in high-speed aerial operations. We evaluate
ViSafe's performance through an extensive test campaign involving both
simulated digital twins and real-world flight scenarios. By independently
varying agent types, closure rates, interaction geometries, and environmental
conditions (e.g., weather and lighting), we demonstrate that ViSafe
consistently ensures self-separation across diverse scenarios. In
first-of-its-kind real-world high-speed collision avoidance tests with closure
rates reaching 144 km/h, ViSafe sets a new benchmark for vision-only autonomous
collision avoidance, establishing a new standard for safety in high-speed
aerial navigation.


## AI 摘要

ViSafe是一种高速纯视觉空中防撞系统，旨在为资源受限的飞行器提供安全关键能力。它通过将基于学习的边缘AI框架与定制多摄像头硬件原型紧密结合，解决了检测与避障（DAA）问题。利用感知输入导向的控制屏障函数（CBF），ViSafe能在高速飞行中提供可证明的安全运行时保障。经过模拟数字孪生和真实飞行场景的广泛测试，ViSafe在不同代理类型、接近速度、交互几何和环境条件下均能确保安全间隔。在最高144公里/小时接近速度的真实测试中，ViSafe为纯视觉自主防撞设立了新标杆。
