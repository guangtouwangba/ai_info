# Demonstrating ViSafe: Vision-enabled Safety for High-speed Detect and Avoid

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03694v1

## 原始摘要

Assured safe-separation is essential for achieving seamless high-density
operation of airborne vehicles in a shared airspace. To equip
resource-constrained aerial systems with this safety-critical capability, we
present ViSafe, a high-speed vision-only airborne collision avoidance system.
ViSafe offers a full-stack solution to the Detect and Avoid (DAA) problem by
tightly integrating a learning-based edge-AI framework with a custom
multi-camera hardware prototype designed under SWaP-C constraints. By
leveraging perceptual input-focused control barrier functions (CBF) to design,
encode, and enforce safety thresholds, ViSafe can provide provably safe runtime
guarantees for self-separation in high-speed aerial operations. We evaluate
ViSafe's performance through an extensive test campaign involving both
simulated digital twins and real-world flight scenarios. By independently
varying agent types, closure rates, interaction geometries, and environmental
conditions (e.g., weather and lighting), we demonstrate that ViSafe
consistently ensures self-separation across diverse scenarios. In
first-of-its-kind real-world high-speed collision avoidance tests with closure
rates reaching 144 km/h, ViSafe sets a new benchmark for vision-only autonomous
collision avoidance, establishing a new standard for safety in high-speed
aerial navigation.
