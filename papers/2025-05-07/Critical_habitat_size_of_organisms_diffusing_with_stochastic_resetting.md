# Critical habitat size of organisms diffusing with stochastic resetting

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03727v1

## 原始摘要

The persistence of populations depends on the minimum habitat area required
for survival, known as the critical patch size. While most studies assume
purely diffusive movement, additional movement components can significantly
alter habitat requirements. Here, we investigate how critical patch sizes are
affected by stochastic resetting, where each organism intermittently returns to
a common fixed location, modeling behaviors such as homing, refuge-seeking, or
movement toward essential resources. We analytically derive the total
population growth over time and the critical patch size. Our results are
validated by agent-based simulations, showing excellent agreement. Our findings
demonstrate that stochastic resetting can either increase or decrease the
critical patch size, depending on the reset rate, reset position, and external
environmental hostility. These results highlight how intermittent relocation
shapes ecological thresholds and may provide insights for ecological modeling
and conservation planning, particularly in fragmented landscapes such as in
deforested regions.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文研究了随机重置行为（如归巢、避难或向资源移动）如何影响物种生存所需的最小栖息地面积（临界斑块大小）。通过理论分析和基于个体的模拟，研究发现随机重置会改变临界斑块大小，其影响取决于重置速率、重置位置和外部环境恶劣程度。结果表明，间歇性迁移行为会塑造生态阈值，这对生态建模和保护规划（特别是森林砍伐等破碎化景观）具有重要启示。研究验证了种群增长理论和临界斑块大小的计算与模拟结果高度一致。
