# Critical habitat size of organisms diffusing with stochastic resetting

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03727v1

## 原始摘要

The persistence of populations depends on the minimum habitat area required
for survival, known as the critical patch size. While most studies assume
purely diffusive movement, additional movement components can significantly
alter habitat requirements. Here, we investigate how critical patch sizes are
affected by stochastic resetting, where each organism intermittently returns to
a common fixed location, modeling behaviors such as homing, refuge-seeking, or
movement toward essential resources. We analytically derive the total
population growth over time and the critical patch size. Our results are
validated by agent-based simulations, showing excellent agreement. Our findings
demonstrate that stochastic resetting can either increase or decrease the
critical patch size, depending on the reset rate, reset position, and external
environmental hostility. These results highlight how intermittent relocation
shapes ecological thresholds and may provide insights for ecological modeling
and conservation planning, particularly in fragmented landscapes such as in
deforested regions.


## AI 摘要

临界斑块大小（维持种群存活的最小栖息地面积）通常基于扩散运动模型研究，但随机重置行为（如归巢、避难或向资源点移动）会显著改变这一阈值。本研究通过理论分析和基于个体的模拟，发现随机重置可通过重置频率、位置及外部环境敌对性双向调节临界斑块大小。当重置促进个体返回有利区域时能减小栖息地需求，反之则增大需求。该机制为破碎化景观（如毁林地区）的生态建模和保护规划提供了新视角，揭示了间歇性迁移行为对生态阈值的塑造作用。理论与模拟结果高度吻合。
