# Critical habitat size of organisms diffusing with stochastic resetting

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03727v1

## 原始摘要

The persistence of populations depends on the minimum habitat area required
for survival, known as the critical patch size. While most studies assume
purely diffusive movement, additional movement components can significantly
alter habitat requirements. Here, we investigate how critical patch sizes are
affected by stochastic resetting, where each organism intermittently returns to
a common fixed location, modeling behaviors such as homing, refuge-seeking, or
movement toward essential resources. We analytically derive the total
population growth over time and the critical patch size. Our results are
validated by agent-based simulations, showing excellent agreement. Our findings
demonstrate that stochastic resetting can either increase or decrease the
critical patch size, depending on the reset rate, reset position, and external
environmental hostility. These results highlight how intermittent relocation
shapes ecological thresholds and may provide insights for ecological modeling
and conservation planning, particularly in fragmented landscapes such as in
deforested regions.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文研究了种群生存所需的最小栖息地面积（临界斑块大小）如何受随机重置行为（如归巢、避难或资源搜寻）的影响。通过理论分析和基于个体的模拟，研究发现随机重置会改变临界斑块大小，具体效果取决于重置频率、重置位置和外部环境恶劣程度。这些发现揭示了间歇性迁移行为对生态阈值的影响，为生态建模和保护规划（特别是森林砍伐等破碎化景观中的保护）提供了新见解。研究验证了理论预测与模拟结果的高度一致性，表明运动行为的复杂性会显著改变栖息地需求。
