# Critical habitat size of organisms diffusing with stochastic resetting

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03727v1

## 原始摘要

The persistence of populations depends on the minimum habitat area required
for survival, known as the critical patch size. While most studies assume
purely diffusive movement, additional movement components can significantly
alter habitat requirements. Here, we investigate how critical patch sizes are
affected by stochastic resetting, where each organism intermittently returns to
a common fixed location, modeling behaviors such as homing, refuge-seeking, or
movement toward essential resources. We analytically derive the total
population growth over time and the critical patch size. Our results are
validated by agent-based simulations, showing excellent agreement. Our findings
demonstrate that stochastic resetting can either increase or decrease the
critical patch size, depending on the reset rate, reset position, and external
environmental hostility. These results highlight how intermittent relocation
shapes ecological thresholds and may provide insights for ecological modeling
and conservation planning, particularly in fragmented landscapes such as in
deforested regions.


## AI 摘要

临界斑块大小是种群持续生存所需的最小栖息地面积。传统研究多假设生物仅通过扩散运动，但额外运动模式（如随机重置）会显著改变栖息地需求。本研究探讨了随机重置（如归巢、避难或资源趋近行为）如何影响临界斑块大小，推导出种群增长模型并验证了理论结果。研究表明：临界斑块大小随重置率、重置位置和外部环境恶劣程度呈现非线性变化——可能增大或减小。该发现揭示了间歇性迁移对生态阈值的影响，为破碎化景观（如毁林地区）的生态建模和保护规划提供了新见解。
