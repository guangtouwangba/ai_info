# Critical habitat size of organisms diffusing with stochastic resetting

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03727v1

## 原始摘要

The persistence of populations depends on the minimum habitat area required
for survival, known as the critical patch size. While most studies assume
purely diffusive movement, additional movement components can significantly
alter habitat requirements. Here, we investigate how critical patch sizes are
affected by stochastic resetting, where each organism intermittently returns to
a common fixed location, modeling behaviors such as homing, refuge-seeking, or
movement toward essential resources. We analytically derive the total
population growth over time and the critical patch size. Our results are
validated by agent-based simulations, showing excellent agreement. Our findings
demonstrate that stochastic resetting can either increase or decrease the
critical patch size, depending on the reset rate, reset position, and external
environmental hostility. These results highlight how intermittent relocation
shapes ecological thresholds and may provide insights for ecological modeling
and conservation planning, particularly in fragmented landscapes such as in
deforested regions.


## AI 摘要

临界栖息地面积（关键斑块大小）对种群存续至关重要。本研究探讨了随机重置行为（如归巢、避难或向资源移动）如何影响这一阈值。通过理论推导和基于个体的模拟验证发现：随机重置会改变关键斑块大小，其影响方向取决于重置频率、重置位置和外部环境恶劣程度。这些发现揭示了间歇性迁移行为如何塑造生态阈值，为破碎化景观（如森林砍伐区）的生态建模和保护规划提供了新见解。研究证实种群增长动态和栖息地需求会因生物运动模式的改变而产生显著变化。
