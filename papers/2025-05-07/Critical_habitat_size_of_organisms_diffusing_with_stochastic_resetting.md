# Critical habitat size of organisms diffusing with stochastic resetting

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03727v1

## 原始摘要

The persistence of populations depends on the minimum habitat area required
for survival, known as the critical patch size. While most studies assume
purely diffusive movement, additional movement components can significantly
alter habitat requirements. Here, we investigate how critical patch sizes are
affected by stochastic resetting, where each organism intermittently returns to
a common fixed location, modeling behaviors such as homing, refuge-seeking, or
movement toward essential resources. We analytically derive the total
population growth over time and the critical patch size. Our results are
validated by agent-based simulations, showing excellent agreement. Our findings
demonstrate that stochastic resetting can either increase or decrease the
critical patch size, depending on the reset rate, reset position, and external
environmental hostility. These results highlight how intermittent relocation
shapes ecological thresholds and may provide insights for ecological modeling
and conservation planning, particularly in fragmented landscapes such as in
deforested regions.


## AI 摘要

临界栖息地面积（临界斑块大小）对种群存续至关重要。本研究探讨了随机重置行为（如归巢、避难或资源导向的间歇性移动）如何影响这一阈值。通过理论分析和基于个体的模拟验证发现，重置行为会依据重置频率、位置及外部环境恶劣程度，双向改变临界斑块需求：既可扩大也可缩小必要栖息范围。这一机制揭示了间歇性迁移对生态阈值的调控作用，为破碎化景观（如森林砍伐区）的保护规划提供了新视角，表明移动行为的复杂性必须纳入栖息地需求评估模型。研究结果对生态建模具有重要启示意义。
