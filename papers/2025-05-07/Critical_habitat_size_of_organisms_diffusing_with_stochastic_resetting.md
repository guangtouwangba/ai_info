# Critical habitat size of organisms diffusing with stochastic resetting

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03727v1

## 原始摘要

The persistence of populations depends on the minimum habitat area required
for survival, known as the critical patch size. While most studies assume
purely diffusive movement, additional movement components can significantly
alter habitat requirements. Here, we investigate how critical patch sizes are
affected by stochastic resetting, where each organism intermittently returns to
a common fixed location, modeling behaviors such as homing, refuge-seeking, or
movement toward essential resources. We analytically derive the total
population growth over time and the critical patch size. Our results are
validated by agent-based simulations, showing excellent agreement. Our findings
demonstrate that stochastic resetting can either increase or decrease the
critical patch size, depending on the reset rate, reset position, and external
environmental hostility. These results highlight how intermittent relocation
shapes ecological thresholds and may provide insights for ecological modeling
and conservation planning, particularly in fragmented landscapes such as in
deforested regions.


## AI 摘要

临界栖息地面积（关键斑块大小）决定了种群的存续能力。传统研究多假设生物仅通过扩散运动，但额外运动模式会显著改变栖息地需求。本研究探讨了随机重置（如归巢、避难或向资源点周期性移动）对关键斑块大小的影响，通过理论推导得出种群增长模型和临界栖息地面积，并得到基于个体模拟的验证。结果表明：随机重置可能增大或减小关键斑块大小，具体取决于重置频率、重置位置和外部环境胁迫程度。这一发现揭示了间歇性迁移如何塑造生态阈值，为破碎化景观（如采伐区）的生态建模和保护规划提供了新见解。（100字）
