# Critical habitat size of organisms diffusing with stochastic resetting

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03727v1

## 原始摘要

The persistence of populations depends on the minimum habitat area required
for survival, known as the critical patch size. While most studies assume
purely diffusive movement, additional movement components can significantly
alter habitat requirements. Here, we investigate how critical patch sizes are
affected by stochastic resetting, where each organism intermittently returns to
a common fixed location, modeling behaviors such as homing, refuge-seeking, or
movement toward essential resources. We analytically derive the total
population growth over time and the critical patch size. Our results are
validated by agent-based simulations, showing excellent agreement. Our findings
demonstrate that stochastic resetting can either increase or decrease the
critical patch size, depending on the reset rate, reset position, and external
environmental hostility. These results highlight how intermittent relocation
shapes ecological thresholds and may provide insights for ecological modeling
and conservation planning, particularly in fragmented landscapes such as in
deforested regions.


## AI 摘要

研究表明，种群存续所需的最小栖息地面积（临界斑块大小）受随机重置行为显著影响。随机重置模拟了生物周期性返回固定位置（如归巢、避难或资源导向）的行为。通过理论分析和基于个体的模拟验证发现，临界斑块大小会随重置频率、重置位置和外部环境恶劣程度而增减。这一发现揭示了间歇性迁移行为如何改变生态阈值，为破碎化景观（如森林砍伐区）的生态建模和保护规划提供了新见解。研究证实，除扩散运动外，其他运动组分也会显著改变栖息地需求。
