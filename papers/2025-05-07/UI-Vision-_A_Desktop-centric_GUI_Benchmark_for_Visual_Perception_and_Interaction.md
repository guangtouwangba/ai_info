# UI-Vision: A Desktop-centric GUI Benchmark for Visual Perception and Interaction

## 原始摘要

Autonomous agents that navigate Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) to automate
tasks like document editing and file management can greatly enhance computer
workflows. While existing research focuses on online settings, desktop
environments, critical for many professional and everyday tasks, remain
underexplored due to data collection challenges and licensing issues. We
introduce UI-Vision, the first comprehensive, license-permissive benchmark for
offline, fine-grained evaluation of computer use agents in real-world desktop
environments. Unlike online benchmarks, UI-Vision provides: (i) dense,
high-quality annotations of human demonstrations, including bounding boxes, UI
labels, and action trajectories (clicks, drags, and keyboard inputs) across 83
software applications, and (ii) three fine-to-coarse grained tasks-Element
Grounding, Layout Grounding, and Action Prediction-with well-defined metrics to
rigorously evaluate agents' performance in desktop environments. Our evaluation
reveals critical limitations in state-of-the-art models like UI-TARS-72B,
including issues with understanding professional software, spatial reasoning,
and complex actions like drag-and-drop. These findings highlight the challenges
in developing fully autonomous computer use agents. By releasing UI-Vision as
open-source, we aim to advance the development of more capable agents for
real-world desktop tasks.


## AI 摘要

UI-Vision是首个针对桌面环境的综合性开源基准测试平台，旨在评估GUI自动化代理的离线性能。它包含83款软件的高质量人工标注数据（边界框、UI标签和操作轨迹）以及三项渐进式任务（元素定位、布局定位和动作预测），填补了现有研究在专业桌面场景的空白。测试发现，当前最先进的UI-TARS-72B模型在专业软件理解、空间推理和拖拽等复杂操作上存在明显缺陷。该开源项目为开发实用的桌面自动化代理提供了重要基准，揭示了实现完全自主计算机操作代理的技术挑战。
