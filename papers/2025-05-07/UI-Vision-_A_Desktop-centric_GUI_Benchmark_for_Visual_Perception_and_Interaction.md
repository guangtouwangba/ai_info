# UI-Vision: A Desktop-centric GUI Benchmark for Visual Perception and Interaction

## 原始摘要

Autonomous agents that navigate Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) to automate
tasks like document editing and file management can greatly enhance computer
workflows. While existing research focuses on online settings, desktop
environments, critical for many professional and everyday tasks, remain
underexplored due to data collection challenges and licensing issues. We
introduce UI-Vision, the first comprehensive, license-permissive benchmark for
offline, fine-grained evaluation of computer use agents in real-world desktop
environments. Unlike online benchmarks, UI-Vision provides: (i) dense,
high-quality annotations of human demonstrations, including bounding boxes, UI
labels, and action trajectories (clicks, drags, and keyboard inputs) across 83
software applications, and (ii) three fine-to-coarse grained tasks-Element
Grounding, Layout Grounding, and Action Prediction-with well-defined metrics to
rigorously evaluate agents' performance in desktop environments. Our evaluation
reveals critical limitations in state-of-the-art models like UI-TARS-72B,
including issues with understanding professional software, spatial reasoning,
and complex actions like drag-and-drop. These findings highlight the challenges
in developing fully autonomous computer use agents. By releasing UI-Vision as
open-source, we aim to advance the development of more capable agents for
real-world desktop tasks.


## AI 摘要

研究人员推出了首个综合性、开源许可的桌面环境智能代理基准测试工具UI-Vision，用于离线评估计算机使用代理在真实桌面环境中的表现。该工具包含83个软件应用中的人类操作标注（边界框、UI标签和点击/拖拽/键盘输入轨迹），并设定了元素定位、布局定位和动作预测三个细粒度任务。测试发现，当前最先进的UI-TARS-72B等模型在专业软件理解、空间推理和拖拽等复杂操作上存在明显不足。UI-Vision的开源发布旨在推动开发更强大的桌面任务自动化代理。
