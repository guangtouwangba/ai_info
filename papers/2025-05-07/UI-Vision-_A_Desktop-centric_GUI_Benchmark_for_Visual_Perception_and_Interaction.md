# UI-Vision: A Desktop-centric GUI Benchmark for Visual Perception and Interaction

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15661v2

## 原始摘要

Autonomous agents that navigate Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) to automate
tasks like document editing and file management can greatly enhance computer
workflows. While existing research focuses on online settings, desktop
environments, critical for many professional and everyday tasks, remain
underexplored due to data collection challenges and licensing issues. We
introduce UI-Vision, the first comprehensive, license-permissive benchmark for
offline, fine-grained evaluation of computer use agents in real-world desktop
environments. Unlike online benchmarks, UI-Vision provides: (i) dense,
high-quality annotations of human demonstrations, including bounding boxes, UI
labels, and action trajectories (clicks, drags, and keyboard inputs) across 83
software applications, and (ii) three fine-to-coarse grained tasks-Element
Grounding, Layout Grounding, and Action Prediction-with well-defined metrics to
rigorously evaluate agents' performance in desktop environments. Our evaluation
reveals critical limitations in state-of-the-art models like UI-TARS-72B,
including issues with understanding professional software, spatial reasoning,
and complex actions like drag-and-drop. These findings highlight the challenges
in developing fully autonomous computer use agents. By releasing UI-Vision as
open-source, we aim to advance the development of more capable agents for
real-world desktop tasks.


## AI 摘要

研究人员提出了UI-Vision，首个针对桌面环境的综合性基准测试工具，用于评估GUI自动化代理的离线细粒度性能。该工具包含83款软件的人类操作标注（边界框、UI标签和动作轨迹）以及三个层级任务（元素定位、布局定位和动作预测），弥补了现有研究在专业桌面环境中的不足。测试发现，当前先进模型（如UI-TARS-72B）在专业软件理解、空间推理和拖拽等复杂操作上存在明显缺陷。开源发布的UI-Vision旨在推动开发更强大的现实桌面任务自动化代理。
