# UI-Vision: A Desktop-centric GUI Benchmark for Visual Perception and Interaction

## 原始摘要

Autonomous agents that navigate Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) to automate
tasks like document editing and file management can greatly enhance computer
workflows. While existing research focuses on online settings, desktop
environments, critical for many professional and everyday tasks, remain
underexplored due to data collection challenges and licensing issues. We
introduce UI-Vision, the first comprehensive, license-permissive benchmark for
offline, fine-grained evaluation of computer use agents in real-world desktop
environments. Unlike online benchmarks, UI-Vision provides: (i) dense,
high-quality annotations of human demonstrations, including bounding boxes, UI
labels, and action trajectories (clicks, drags, and keyboard inputs) across 83
software applications, and (ii) three fine-to-coarse grained tasks-Element
Grounding, Layout Grounding, and Action Prediction-with well-defined metrics to
rigorously evaluate agents' performance in desktop environments. Our evaluation
reveals critical limitations in state-of-the-art models like UI-TARS-72B,
including issues with understanding professional software, spatial reasoning,
and complex actions like drag-and-drop. These findings highlight the challenges
in developing fully autonomous computer use agents. By releasing UI-Vision as
open-source, we aim to advance the development of more capable agents for
real-world desktop tasks.


## AI 摘要

UI-Vision是首个针对桌面环境的综合性开源基准测试，用于评估图形用户界面(GUI)自主代理的离线细粒度性能。该基准包含83个软件应用中的人类操作标注（边界框、UI标签和动作轨迹）以及三个任务：元素定位、布局定位和动作预测。研究发现，即使是UI-TARS-72B等先进模型，在处理专业软件、空间推理和拖拽等复杂操作时仍存在明显局限。UI-Vision的发布旨在推动开发更强大的桌面任务自动化代理，解决现有研究在真实桌面环境数据收集和许可方面的不足。
