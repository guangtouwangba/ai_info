# UI-Vision: A Desktop-centric GUI Benchmark for Visual Perception and Interaction

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15661v2

## 原始摘要

Autonomous agents that navigate Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) to automate
tasks like document editing and file management can greatly enhance computer
workflows. While existing research focuses on online settings, desktop
environments, critical for many professional and everyday tasks, remain
underexplored due to data collection challenges and licensing issues. We
introduce UI-Vision, the first comprehensive, license-permissive benchmark for
offline, fine-grained evaluation of computer use agents in real-world desktop
environments. Unlike online benchmarks, UI-Vision provides: (i) dense,
high-quality annotations of human demonstrations, including bounding boxes, UI
labels, and action trajectories (clicks, drags, and keyboard inputs) across 83
software applications, and (ii) three fine-to-coarse grained tasks-Element
Grounding, Layout Grounding, and Action Prediction-with well-defined metrics to
rigorously evaluate agents' performance in desktop environments. Our evaluation
reveals critical limitations in state-of-the-art models like UI-TARS-72B,
including issues with understanding professional software, spatial reasoning,
and complex actions like drag-and-drop. These findings highlight the challenges
in developing fully autonomous computer use agents. By releasing UI-Vision as
open-source, we aim to advance the development of more capable agents for
real-world desktop tasks.


## AI 摘要

研究人员提出了首个针对桌面环境的综合性基准测试UI-Vision，用于评估图形用户界面(GUI)自主代理的离线性能。该基准包含83个软件应用的高质量人工标注数据（边界框、UI标签和操作轨迹）以及三个粒度递进的任务：元素定位、布局定位和动作预测。评估发现当前最先进模型（如UI-TARS-72B）在专业软件理解、空间推理和拖拽等复杂操作上存在明显缺陷。UI-Vision作为开源项目发布，旨在推动开发更强大的现实桌面任务自主代理，解决现有研究因数据收集和许可问题对桌面环境关注不足的现状。
