# "Trust me on this" Explaining Agent Behavior to a Human Terminator

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04592v2

## 原始摘要

Consider a setting where a pre-trained agent is operating in an environment
and a human operator can decide to temporarily terminate its operation and
take-over for some duration of time. These kind of scenarios are common in
human-machine interactions, for example in autonomous driving, factory
automation and healthcare. In these settings, we typically observe a trade-off
between two extreme cases -- if no take-overs are allowed, then the agent might
employ a sub-optimal, possibly dangerous policy. Alternatively, if there are
too many take-overs, then the human has no confidence in the agent, greatly
limiting its usefulness. In this paper, we formalize this setup and propose an
explainability scheme to help optimize the number of human interventions.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了人机协作中人类接管预训练智能体时的权衡问题。在自动驾驶、工业自动化和医疗等场景中，完全禁止接管可能导致智能体执行次优或危险策略，而过多接管又会降低人类对智能体的信任，削弱其效用。论文通过形式化建模这一场景，提出了一种可解释性方案，旨在优化人类干预频率，平衡系统自主性与人工监督之间的关系，从而提高人机协作的效率和安全性。
