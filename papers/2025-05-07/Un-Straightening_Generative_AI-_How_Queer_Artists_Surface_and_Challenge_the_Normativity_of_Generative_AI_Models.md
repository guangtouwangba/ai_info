# Un-Straightening Generative AI: How Queer Artists Surface and Challenge the Normativity of Generative AI Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09805v2

## 原始摘要

Queer people are often discussed as targets of bias, harm, or discrimination
in research on generative AI. However, the specific ways that queer people
engage with generative AI, and thus possible uses that support queer people,
have yet to be explored. We conducted a workshop study with 13 queer artists,
during which we gave participants access to GPT-4 and DALL-E 3 and facilitated
group sensemaking activities. We found our participants struggled to use these
models due to various normative values embedded in their designs, such as
hyper-positivity and anti-sexuality. We describe various strategies our
participants developed to overcome these models' limitations and how,
nevertheless, our participants found value in these highly-normative
technologies. Drawing on queer feminist theory, we discuss implications for the
conceptualization of "state-of-the-art" models and consider how FAccT
researchers might support queer alternatives.


## AI 摘要

这项研究探讨了酷儿群体与生成式AI的互动方式。通过13位酷儿艺术家的工作坊实验，研究者发现主流AI模型（如GPT-4和DALL-E 3）的设计中隐含的规范性价值观（如过度积极和反性倾向）给酷儿用户带来使用障碍。尽管参与者开发了应对策略并仍从中获得价值，但研究指出当前"最先进"AI模型的局限性。基于酷儿女性主义理论，研究者建议FAccT（公平、问责和透明）领域应支持更具包容性的替代方案，而非仅将酷儿群体视为技术偏见的受害者。研究揭示了AI设计中未被充分关注的酷儿需求维度。
