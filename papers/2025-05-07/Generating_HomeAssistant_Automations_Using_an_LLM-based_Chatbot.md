## 原始摘要

To combat climate change, individuals are encouraged to adopt sustainable
habits, in particular, with their household, optimizing their electrical
consumption. Conversational agents, such as Smart Home Assistants, hold promise
as effective tools for promoting sustainable practices within households. Our
research investigated the application of Large Language Models (LLM) in
enhancing smart home automation and promoting sustainable household practices,
specifically using the HomeAssistant framework. In particular, it highlights
the potential of GPT models in generating accurate automation routines. While
the LLMs showed proficiency in understanding complex commands and creating
valid JSON outputs, challenges such as syntax errors and message malformations
were noted, indicating areas for further improvement. Still, despite minimal
quantitative differences between "green" and "no green" prompts, qualitative
feedback highlighted a positive shift towards sustainability in the routines
generated with environmentally focused prompts. Then, an empirical evaluation
(N=56) demonstrated that the system was well-received and found engaging by
users compared to its traditional rule-based counterpart. Our findings
highlight the role of LLMs in advancing smart home technologies and suggest
further research to refine these models for broader, real-world applications to
support sustainable living.


## AI 摘要

这项研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）在智能家居自动化中的应用，特别是通过HomeAssistant框架促进家庭可持续实践。研究发现，GPT模型能有效理解复杂指令并生成准确的自动化JSON代码，但仍存在语法错误等问题。尽管"环保"提示与普通提示在量化差异上不明显，但环保提示能引导生成更具可持续性的方案。用户测试（N=56）显示，相比传统规则系统，基于LLM的方案更受欢迎且互动性更强。研究肯定了LLM推动智能家居技术发展的潜力，建议进一步优化模型以支持可持续生活的实际应用。
