# The Dilemma Between Euphoria and Freedom in Recommendation Algorithms

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11465v1

## 原始摘要

Today's AI recommendation algorithms produce a human dilemma between euphoria
and freedom. To elaborate, four ways that recommenders reshape experience are
delineated. First, the human experience of convenience is tuned to euphoric
perfection. Second, a kind of personal authenticity becomes capturable with
algorithms and data. Third, a conception of human freedom emerges, one that
promotes unfamiliar interests for users instead of satisfying those that
already exist. Finally, a new human dilemma is posed between two types of
personal identity. On one side, there are recommendation algorithms that locate
a user's core preferences, and then reinforce that identity with options
designed to resemble those that have already proved satisfying. The result is
an algorithmic production of euphoria and authenticity. On the other side,
there are recommenders that provoke unfamiliar interests and curiosities. These
proposals deny the existence of an authentic self and instead promote new
preferences and experiences. The result is a human freedom of new personal
identity.


## AI 摘要

当前AI推荐算法在用户愉悦感和自由选择之间制造了新的矛盾。算法通过四种方式重塑用户体验：1）将便利性优化至极致愉悦；2）用数据量化个人真实性；3）通过推荐陌生兴趣拓展自由定义；4）引发两种身份认同的冲突。一方面，算法通过强化已知偏好制造确定性愉悦和"真实自我"；另一方面，通过激发新兴趣否定固定身份，创造重塑自我的自由。这形成了现代人面临的核心困境：是选择算法强化的稳定认同，还是拥抱算法提供的变化可能。（98字）
