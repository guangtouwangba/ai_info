# The Dilemma Between Euphoria and Freedom in Recommendation Algorithms

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11465v1

## 原始摘要

Today's AI recommendation algorithms produce a human dilemma between euphoria
and freedom. To elaborate, four ways that recommenders reshape experience are
delineated. First, the human experience of convenience is tuned to euphoric
perfection. Second, a kind of personal authenticity becomes capturable with
algorithms and data. Third, a conception of human freedom emerges, one that
promotes unfamiliar interests for users instead of satisfying those that
already exist. Finally, a new human dilemma is posed between two types of
personal identity. On one side, there are recommendation algorithms that locate
a user's core preferences, and then reinforce that identity with options
designed to resemble those that have already proved satisfying. The result is
an algorithmic production of euphoria and authenticity. On the other side,
there are recommenders that provoke unfamiliar interests and curiosities. These
proposals deny the existence of an authentic self and instead promote new
preferences and experiences. The result is a human freedom of new personal
identity.


## AI 摘要

当前AI推荐算法带来了"愉悦与自由"的人类困境。算法通过四种方式重塑体验：1)将便利性优化至极致愉悦；2)用数据捕捉个人真实性；3)催生新兴趣而非满足既有偏好；4)制造两种身份认同的张力。一方面，算法通过强化既有偏好产生确定的愉悦感和真实性；另一方面，通过激发新兴趣否认固定自我，创造重塑身份的自由。这形成了推荐系统制造的核心矛盾——是选择算法强化的稳定身份带来的确定感，还是拥抱算法推荐的新可能性带来的自由感。
