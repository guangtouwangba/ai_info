# How AI Generates Creativity from Inauthenticity

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11463v1

## 原始摘要

Artificial creativity is presented as a counter to Benjamin's conception of
an "aura" in art. Where Benjamin sees authenticity as art's critical element,
generative artificial intelligence operates as pure inauthenticity. Two
elements of purely inauthentic art are described: elusiveness and reflection.
Elusiveness is the inability to find an origin-story for the created artwork,
and reflection is the ability for perceivers to impose any origin that serves
their own purposes. The paper subsequently argues that these elements widen the
scope of artistic and creative potential. To illustrate, an example is
developed around musical improvisation with an artificial intelligence partner.
Finally, a question is raised about whether the inauthentic creativity of AI in
art can be extended to human experience and our sense of our identities.


## AI 摘要

该论文探讨了人工智能艺术如何挑战本雅明提出的艺术"灵光"概念。作者指出，AI生成艺术具有纯粹非真实性特征，表现为"不可追溯性"（作品无明确创作来源）和"投射性"（观者可自行赋予任何创作背景）。这种特性反而拓展了艺术创作的可能性。文中以AI音乐即兴创作为例，并进一步思考：AI艺术的非真实性特质是否会影响人类对自身身份认同的认知。论文认为，AI艺术通过打破传统真实性的束缚，为艺术创作开辟了新路径。
