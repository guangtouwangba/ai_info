# How AI Generates Creativity from Inauthenticity

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11463v1

## 原始摘要

Artificial creativity is presented as a counter to Benjamin's conception of
an "aura" in art. Where Benjamin sees authenticity as art's critical element,
generative artificial intelligence operates as pure inauthenticity. Two
elements of purely inauthentic art are described: elusiveness and reflection.
Elusiveness is the inability to find an origin-story for the created artwork,
and reflection is the ability for perceivers to impose any origin that serves
their own purposes. The paper subsequently argues that these elements widen the
scope of artistic and creative potential. To illustrate, an example is
developed around musical improvisation with an artificial intelligence partner.
Finally, a question is raised about whether the inauthentic creativity of AI in
art can be extended to human experience and our sense of our identities.


## AI 摘要

本文提出人工创造力是对本雅明艺术"灵光"概念的挑战。本雅明认为真实性是艺术的核心要素，而生成式AI艺术则体现纯粹的非真实性。这种非真实艺术具有两个特征：难以追溯创作源头（模糊性）和允许观者自行赋予创作意图（投射性）。文章认为这些特质拓展了艺术创作的潜力，并以AI音乐即兴创作为例说明。最后探讨了AI的非真实创造力是否可延伸至人类对自我身份的认知体验。全文围绕AI艺术对传统艺术真实性的解构及其创造性可能展开讨论。（99字）
