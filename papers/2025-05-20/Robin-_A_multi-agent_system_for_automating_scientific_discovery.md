# Robin: A multi-agent system for automating scientific discovery

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13400v1

## 原始摘要

Scientific discovery is driven by the iterative process of background
research, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and data analysis. Despite
recent advancements in applying artificial intelligence to scientific
discovery, no system has yet automated all of these stages in a single
workflow. Here, we introduce Robin, the first multi-agent system capable of
fully automating the key intellectual steps of the scientific process. By
integrating literature search agents with data analysis agents, Robin can
generate hypotheses, propose experiments, interpret experimental results, and
generate updated hypotheses, achieving a semi-autonomous approach to scientific
discovery. By applying this system, we were able to identify a novel treatment
for dry age-related macular degeneration (dAMD), the major cause of blindness
in the developed world. Robin proposed enhancing retinal pigment epithelium
phagocytosis as a therapeutic strategy, and identified and validated a
promising therapeutic candidate, ripasudil. Ripasudil is a clinically-used rho
kinase (ROCK) inhibitor that has never previously been proposed for treating
dAMD. To elucidate the mechanism of ripasudil-induced upregulation of
phagocytosis, Robin then proposed and analyzed a follow-up RNA-seq experiment,
which revealed upregulation of ABCA1, a critical lipid efflux pump and possible
novel target. All hypotheses, experimental plans, data analyses, and data
figures in the main text of this report were produced by Robin. As the first AI
system to autonomously discover and validate a novel therapeutic candidate
within an iterative lab-in-the-loop framework, Robin establishes a new paradigm
for AI-driven scientific discovery.


## AI 摘要

研究人员开发了首个全自动多智能体系统Robin，能够自主完成科学发现的关键步骤：文献检索、假设生成、实验设计和数据分析。该系统成功应用于年龄相关性黄斑变性(dAMD)治疗研究，提出了增强视网膜色素上皮细胞吞噬作用的治疗策略，并发现临床药物瑞帕舒地(ripasudil)具有潜在疗效。后续RNA测序实验显示该药物通过上调ABCA1(一种关键脂质外排泵)发挥作用。所有假设、实验方案和数据分析均由Robin自主完成，首次实现了"实验室闭环"框架下的AI自主药物发现，为人工智能驱动的科研建立了新范式。
