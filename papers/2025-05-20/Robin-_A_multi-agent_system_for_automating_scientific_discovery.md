# Robin: A multi-agent system for automating scientific discovery

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13400v1

## 原始摘要

Scientific discovery is driven by the iterative process of background
research, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and data analysis. Despite
recent advancements in applying artificial intelligence to scientific
discovery, no system has yet automated all of these stages in a single
workflow. Here, we introduce Robin, the first multi-agent system capable of
fully automating the key intellectual steps of the scientific process. By
integrating literature search agents with data analysis agents, Robin can
generate hypotheses, propose experiments, interpret experimental results, and
generate updated hypotheses, achieving a semi-autonomous approach to scientific
discovery. By applying this system, we were able to identify a novel treatment
for dry age-related macular degeneration (dAMD), the major cause of blindness
in the developed world. Robin proposed enhancing retinal pigment epithelium
phagocytosis as a therapeutic strategy, and identified and validated a
promising therapeutic candidate, ripasudil. Ripasudil is a clinically-used rho
kinase (ROCK) inhibitor that has never previously been proposed for treating
dAMD. To elucidate the mechanism of ripasudil-induced upregulation of
phagocytosis, Robin then proposed and analyzed a follow-up RNA-seq experiment,
which revealed upregulation of ABCA1, a critical lipid efflux pump and possible
novel target. All hypotheses, experimental plans, data analyses, and data
figures in the main text of this report were produced by Robin. As the first AI
system to autonomously discover and validate a novel therapeutic candidate
within an iterative lab-in-the-loop framework, Robin establishes a new paradigm
for AI-driven scientific discovery.


## AI 摘要

研究人员开发了首个全自动科学发现多智能体系统Robin，该系统能自主完成文献检索、假设生成、实验设计、数据分析和假设更新等科研全流程。通过该系统，研究者发现了一种治疗干性年龄相关性黄斑变性（dAMD）的新方法：增强视网膜色素上皮细胞的吞噬功能。Robin识别并验证了临床已有药物Ripasudil（一种ROCK抑制剂）的潜在疗效，并通过RNA测序实验发现其作用机制可能与上调ABCA1基因有关。该系统实现了"实验室闭环"的AI自主科研范式，所有假设、实验方案和数据分析均由AI自主完成。
