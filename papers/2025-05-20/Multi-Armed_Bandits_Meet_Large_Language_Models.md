**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13355v1

## 原始摘要

Bandit algorithms and Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful
tools in artificial intelligence, each addressing distinct yet complementary
challenges in decision-making and natural language processing. This survey
explores the synergistic potential between these two fields, highlighting how
bandit algorithms can enhance the performance of LLMs and how LLMs, in turn,
can provide novel insights for improving bandit-based decision-making. We first
examine the role of bandit algorithms in optimizing LLM fine-tuning, prompt
engineering, and adaptive response generation, focusing on their ability to
balance exploration and exploitation in large-scale learning tasks.
Subsequently, we explore how LLMs can augment bandit algorithms through
advanced contextual understanding, dynamic adaptation, and improved policy
selection using natural language reasoning. By providing a comprehensive review
of existing research and identifying key challenges and opportunities, this
survey aims to bridge the gap between bandit algorithms and LLMs, paving the
way for innovative applications and interdisciplinary research in AI.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了多臂老虎机算法（Bandit）与大语言模型（LLM）的协同潜力。老虎机算法通过平衡探索与利用，可优化LLM的微调、提示工程和自适应响应生成；而LLM则能增强老虎机算法的上下文理解、动态适应和基于自然语言的策略选择。研究综述了现有成果，指出两者互补的优势：老虎机算法提升LLM的决策效率，LLM为老虎机算法提供语义推理支持。这一交叉研究为AI领域开辟了新方向，有望推动自适应学习与语言处理的创新发展，但仍需解决关键挑战以实现深度融合。
