**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13355v1

## 原始摘要

Bandit algorithms and Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful
tools in artificial intelligence, each addressing distinct yet complementary
challenges in decision-making and natural language processing. This survey
explores the synergistic potential between these two fields, highlighting how
bandit algorithms can enhance the performance of LLMs and how LLMs, in turn,
can provide novel insights for improving bandit-based decision-making. We first
examine the role of bandit algorithms in optimizing LLM fine-tuning, prompt
engineering, and adaptive response generation, focusing on their ability to
balance exploration and exploitation in large-scale learning tasks.
Subsequently, we explore how LLMs can augment bandit algorithms through
advanced contextual understanding, dynamic adaptation, and improved policy
selection using natural language reasoning. By providing a comprehensive review
of existing research and identifying key challenges and opportunities, this
survey aims to bridge the gap between bandit algorithms and LLMs, paving the
way for innovative applications and interdisciplinary research in AI.
