# MOSAAIC: Managing Optimization towards Shared Autonomy, Authority, and Initiative in Co-creation

## 原始摘要

Striking the appropriate balance between humans and co-creative AI is an open
research question in computational creativity. Co-creativity, a form of hybrid
intelligence where both humans and AI take action proactively, is a process
that leads to shared creative artifacts and ideas. Achieving a balanced dynamic
in co-creativity requires characterizing control and identifying strategies to
distribute control between humans and AI. We define control as the power to
determine, initiate, and direct the process of co-creation. Informed by a
systematic literature review of 172 full-length papers, we introduce MOSAAIC
(Managing Optimization towards Shared Autonomy, Authority, and Initiative in
Co-creation), a novel framework for characterizing and balancing control in
co-creation. MOSAAIC identifies three key dimensions of control: autonomy,
initiative, and authority. We supplement our framework with control
optimization strategies in co-creation. To demonstrate MOSAAIC's applicability,
we analyze the distribution of control in six existing co-creative AI case
studies and present the implications of using this framework.


## AI 摘要

计算创造力领域的关键挑战是如何平衡人类与AI在协同创作中的控制权。协同创作是一种混合智能形式，人类和AI主动合作产生创意成果。研究通过系统文献综述提出MOSAAIC框架，从自主性、主动性和权威性三个维度来表征和优化控制权分配。该框架分析了6个协同创作案例中的控制权分布，为平衡人机协作提供了策略。MOSAAIC将控制权定义为决定、发起和指导协同创作过程的能力，为人机共创系统的设计提供了理论支持。
