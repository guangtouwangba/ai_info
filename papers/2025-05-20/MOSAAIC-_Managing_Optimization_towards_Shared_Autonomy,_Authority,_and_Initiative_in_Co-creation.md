# MOSAAIC: Managing Optimization towards Shared Autonomy, Authority, and Initiative in Co-creation

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11481v1

## 原始摘要

Striking the appropriate balance between humans and co-creative AI is an open
research question in computational creativity. Co-creativity, a form of hybrid
intelligence where both humans and AI take action proactively, is a process
that leads to shared creative artifacts and ideas. Achieving a balanced dynamic
in co-creativity requires characterizing control and identifying strategies to
distribute control between humans and AI. We define control as the power to
determine, initiate, and direct the process of co-creation. Informed by a
systematic literature review of 172 full-length papers, we introduce MOSAAIC
(Managing Optimization towards Shared Autonomy, Authority, and Initiative in
Co-creation), a novel framework for characterizing and balancing control in
co-creation. MOSAAIC identifies three key dimensions of control: autonomy,
initiative, and authority. We supplement our framework with control
optimization strategies in co-creation. To demonstrate MOSAAIC's applicability,
we analyze the distribution of control in six existing co-creative AI case
studies and present the implications of using this framework.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文探讨了人类与AI在协同创作中如何平衡控制权的问题。研究者提出了MOSAAIC框架，通过三个关键维度（自主性、主动性和权威性）来分析和优化协同创作中的控制权分配。该框架基于对172篇论文的系统性文献综述，并通过对6个案例研究的分析验证了其适用性。MOSAAIC为理解和管理人机协同创作中的控制动态提供了新方法，有助于实现更有效的创造性合作。研究强调了在协同创作过程中明确界定和分配控制权的重要性，为人机协作的优化策略提供了理论基础。
