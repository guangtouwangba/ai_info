# Empowering Scientific Workflows with Federated Agents

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05428v1

## 原始摘要

Agentic systems, in which diverse agents cooperate to tackle challenging
problems, are exploding in popularity in the AI community. However, the agentic
frameworks used to build these systems have not previously enabled use with
research cyberinfrastructure. Here we introduce Academy, a modular and
extensible middleware designed to deploy autonomous agents across the federated
research ecosystem, including HPC systems, experimental facilities, and data
repositories. To meet the demands of scientific computing, Academy supports
asynchronous execution, heterogeneous resources, high-throughput data flows,
and dynamic resource availability. It provides abstractions for expressing
stateful agents, managing inter-agent coordination, and integrating computation
with experimental control. We present microbenchmark results that demonstrate
high performance and scalability in HPC environments. To demonstrate the
breadth of applications that can be supported by agentic workflow designs, we
also present case studies in materials discovery, decentralized learning, and
information extraction in which agents are deployed across diverse HPC systems.


## AI 摘要

本文介绍了Academy，一种模块化、可扩展的中间件，旨在将自主代理部署到联邦研究生态系统中，包括高性能计算（HPC）系统、实验设施和数据存储库。Academy支持异步执行、异构资源、高吞吐量数据流和动态资源可用性，满足科学计算需求。它提供了状态代理、代理间协调以及计算与实验控制集成的抽象。微基准测试显示其在HPC环境中具有高性能和可扩展性。案例研究展示了代理在工作流设计中的广泛应用，包括材料发现、去中心化学习和信息提取，证明了其在跨HPC系统中的实用性。
