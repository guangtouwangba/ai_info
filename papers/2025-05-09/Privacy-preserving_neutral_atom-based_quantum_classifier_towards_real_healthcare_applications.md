## 原始摘要

Technological advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning
(ML) for the healthcare domain are rapidly arising, with a growing discussion
regarding the ethical management of their development. In general, ML
healthcare applications crucially require performance, interpretability of
data, and respect for data privacy. The latter is an increasingly debated topic
as commercial cloud computing services become more and more widespread.
Recently, dedicated methods are starting to be developed aiming to protect data
privacy. However, these generally result in a trade-off forcing one to balance
the level of data privacy and the algorithm performance. Here, a Support Vector
Machine (SVM) classifier model is proposed whose training is reformulated into
a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, and adapted to a
neutral atom-based Quantum Processing Unit (QPU). Our final model does not
require anonymization techniques to protect data privacy since the sensitive
data are not needed to be transferred to the cloud-available QPU. Indeed, the
latter is used only during the training phase, hence allowing a future concrete
application in a real-world scenario. Finally, performance and scaling analyses
on a publicly available breast cancer dataset are discussed, both using ideal
and noisy simulations for the training process, and also successfully tested on
a currently available real neutral-atom QPU.


## AI 摘要

人工智能和机器学习在医疗领域的技术发展迅速，但随之而来的数据隐私和伦理问题日益受到关注。传统方法常需在隐私保护与算法性能间权衡。本研究提出了一种基于支持向量机（SVM）的分类模型，将其训练过程重构为二次无约束二元优化（QUBO）问题，并适配中性原子量子处理器（QPU）。该模型无需将敏感数据传输至云端QPU即可完成训练，从而避免隐私泄露风险。实验在公开乳腺癌数据集上验证了性能，并测试了理想模拟、噪声模拟及真实QPU环境下的表现，为实际应用提供了可行性方案。（100字）
