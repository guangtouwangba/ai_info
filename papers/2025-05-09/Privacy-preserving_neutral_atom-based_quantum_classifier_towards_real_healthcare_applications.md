## 原始摘要

Technological advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning
(ML) for the healthcare domain are rapidly arising, with a growing discussion
regarding the ethical management of their development. In general, ML
healthcare applications crucially require performance, interpretability of
data, and respect for data privacy. The latter is an increasingly debated topic
as commercial cloud computing services become more and more widespread.
Recently, dedicated methods are starting to be developed aiming to protect data
privacy. However, these generally result in a trade-off forcing one to balance
the level of data privacy and the algorithm performance. Here, a Support Vector
Machine (SVM) classifier model is proposed whose training is reformulated into
a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, and adapted to a
neutral atom-based Quantum Processing Unit (QPU). Our final model does not
require anonymization techniques to protect data privacy since the sensitive
data are not needed to be transferred to the cloud-available QPU. Indeed, the
latter is used only during the training phase, hence allowing a future concrete
application in a real-world scenario. Finally, performance and scaling analyses
on a publicly available breast cancer dataset are discussed, both using ideal
and noisy simulations for the training process, and also successfully tested on
a currently available real neutral-atom QPU.
