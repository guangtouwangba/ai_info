## 原始摘要

Technological advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning
(ML) for the healthcare domain are rapidly arising, with a growing discussion
regarding the ethical management of their development. In general, ML
healthcare applications crucially require performance, interpretability of
data, and respect for data privacy. The latter is an increasingly debated topic
as commercial cloud computing services become more and more widespread.
Recently, dedicated methods are starting to be developed aiming to protect data
privacy. However, these generally result in a trade-off forcing one to balance
the level of data privacy and the algorithm performance. Here, a Support Vector
Machine (SVM) classifier model is proposed whose training is reformulated into
a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, and adapted to a
neutral atom-based Quantum Processing Unit (QPU). Our final model does not
require anonymization techniques to protect data privacy since the sensitive
data are not needed to be transferred to the cloud-available QPU. Indeed, the
latter is used only during the training phase, hence allowing a future concrete
application in a real-world scenario. Finally, performance and scaling analyses
on a publicly available breast cancer dataset are discussed, both using ideal
and noisy simulations for the training process, and also successfully tested on
a currently available real neutral-atom QPU.


## AI 摘要

人工智能和机器学习在医疗领域的应用快速发展，但引发了数据隐私和伦理管理的讨论。传统方法需要在数据隐私和算法性能之间权衡。本研究提出了一种基于支持向量机（SVM）的分类模型，将其训练过程转化为二次无约束二进制优化（QUBO）问题，并适配中性原子量子处理器（QPU）。该模型无需将敏感数据传输到云端QPU，从而避免数据匿名化处理，仅在训练阶段使用QPU。研究在公开乳腺癌数据集上进行了性能和扩展性分析，包括理想和噪声模拟训练，并成功在实际QPU上测试，展示了现实应用潜力。
