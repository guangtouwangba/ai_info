# Perpetuating Misogyny with Generative AI: How Model Personalization Normalizes Gendered Harm

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04600v1

## 原始摘要

Open-source text-to-image (TTI) pipelines have become dominant in the
landscape of AI-generated visual content, driven by technological advances that
enable users to personalize models through adapters tailored to specific tasks.
While personalization methods such as LoRA offer unprecedented creative
opportunities, they also facilitate harmful practices, including the generation
of non-consensual deepfakes and the amplification of misogynistic or
hypersexualized content. This study presents an exploratory sociotechnical
analysis of CivitAI, the most active platform for sharing and developing
open-source TTI models. Drawing on a dataset of more than 40 million
user-generated images and over 230,000 models, we find a disproportionate rise
in not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content and a significant number of models intended
to mimic real individuals. We also observe a strong influence of internet
subcultures on the tools and practices shaping model personalizations and
resulting visual media. In response to these findings, we contextualize the
emergence of exploitative visual media through feminist and constructivist
perspectives on technology, emphasizing how design choices and community
dynamics shape platform outcomes. Building on this analysis, we propose
interventions aimed at mitigating downstream harm, including improved content
moderation, rethinking tool design, and establishing clearer platform policies
to promote accountability and consent.


## AI 摘要

开源文本生成图像（TTI）技术因个性化适配器的发展而普及，但也助长了非自愿深度伪造和性别歧视等有害内容。研究分析了最大的开源TTI平台CivitAI，发现平台中不适宜工作场所（NSFW）内容激增，且大量模型用于模仿真实人物。互联网亚文化显著影响了模型定制和视觉内容的生成。研究从女权主义和建构主义视角探讨了剥削性视觉内容的成因，指出平台设计和社区动态的影响。为此，建议加强内容审核、优化工具设计并制定更明确的平台政策，以减少危害并增强责任与同意意识。
