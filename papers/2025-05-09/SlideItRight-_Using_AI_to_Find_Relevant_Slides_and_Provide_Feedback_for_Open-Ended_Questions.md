# SlideItRight: Using AI to Find Relevant Slides and Provide Feedback for Open-Ended Questions

## 原始摘要

Feedback is important in supporting student learning. While various automated
feedback systems have been implemented to make the feedback scalable, many
existing solutions only focus on generating text-based feedback. As is
indicated in the multimedia learning principle, learning with more modalities
could help utilize more separate channels, reduce the cognitive load and
facilitate students' learning. Hence, it is important to explore the potential
of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in feedback generation from and to different
modalities. Our study leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for textual
feedback with the supplementary guidance from other modality - relevant lecture
slide retrieved from the slides hub. Through an online crowdsourcing study
(N=91), this study investigates learning gains and student perceptions using a
2x2 design (i.e., human feedback vs. AI feedback and with vs. without relevant
slide), evaluating the clarity, engagement, perceived effectiveness, and
reliability) of AI-facilitated multimodal feedback. We observed significant
pre-to-post learning gains across all conditions. However, the differences in
these gains were not statistically significant between conditions. The
post-survey revealed that students found the slide feedback helpful in their
learning process, though they reported difficulty in understanding it.
Regarding the AI-generated open-ended feedback, students considered it
personalized and relevant to their responses, but they expressed lower trust in
the AI feedback compared to human-generated feedback.


## AI 摘要

研究表明，AI生成的多模态反馈（结合文本与相关幻灯片）能有效提升学习效果，但不同反馈方式（AI/人工、有无幻灯片）的学习增益差异不显著。91名参与者的实验显示，幻灯片辅助虽被认为有帮助，但存在理解难度；AI文本反馈被认为个性化和相关，但信任度低于人工反馈。该研究验证了多媒体学习理论中多通道反馈的优势，同时揭示了AI反馈在可信度方面的现存挑战。所有实验组均表现出显著的前后测学习提升，说明AI辅助反馈具有应用潜力，但需进一步优化理解性和可信度。
