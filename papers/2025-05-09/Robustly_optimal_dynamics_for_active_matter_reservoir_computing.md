# Robustly optimal dynamics for active matter reservoir computing

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05420v1

## 原始摘要

We study the information processing abilities of active matter in the
reservoir computing (RC) paradigm, using a model that is externally driven to
infer the future state of a chaotic signal. The simulated system closely
follows a previously reported model. We uncover an exceptional dynamical regime
of agent dynamics that has been overlooked heretofore. It appears robustly
optimal across varying physical parameters and inference tasks, thus providing
valuable insights into computation and inference with physical systems more
generally. The ability to form effective mechanisms for information processing
are primarily determined by the system's own intrinsic relaxation abilities.
These are identifiable when probing the system without a specific inference
goal and manifest when testing minimalistic single-particle reservoirs. The
regime that achieves optimal computation is situated just below the critical
damping threshold, involving a microscopic dynamical relaxation with multiple
stages. The optimal system is adaptable under chaotic external driving, due to
a diversity in response mechanisms that emerge like rapid alternations between
quasi-stationary and highly nonlinear dynamical states. Both coherent and
incoherent dynamics contribute to their operation, partly at dissimilar scales
of space and delay time. Correlations on agent dynamics can indicate the
best-performing regimes and onsets of tight relationships between the
responding system and the fluctuating driver. As this model of computation is
interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding
learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body
physics out of equilibrium.
