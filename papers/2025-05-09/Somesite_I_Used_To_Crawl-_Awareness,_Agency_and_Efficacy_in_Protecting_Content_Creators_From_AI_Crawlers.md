# Somesite I Used To Crawl: Awareness, Agency and Efficacy in Protecting Content Creators From AI Crawlers

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15091v2

## 原始摘要

The success of generative AI relies heavily on training on data scraped
through extensive crawling of the Internet, a practice that has raised
significant copyright, privacy, and ethical concerns. While few measures are
designed to resist a resource-rich adversary determined to scrape a site,
crawlers can be impacted by a range of existing tools such as robots.txt, NoAI
meta tags, and active crawler blocking by reverse proxies.
  In this work, we seek to understand the ability and efficacy of today's
networking tools to protect content creators against AI-related crawling. For
targeted populations like human artists, do they have the technical knowledge
and agency to utilize crawler-blocking tools such as robots.txt, and can such
tools be effective? Using large scale measurements and a targeted user study of
203 professional artists, we find strong demand for tools like robots.txt, but
significantly constrained by critical hurdles in technical awareness, agency in
deploying them, and limited efficacy against unresponsive crawlers. We further
test and evaluate network-level crawler blockers provided by reverse proxies.
Despite relatively limited deployment today, they offer stronger protections
against AI crawlers, but still come with their own set of limitations.


## AI 摘要

生成式AI的成功依赖于从互联网抓取的大量训练数据，但这一做法引发了版权、隐私和伦理争议。现有工具如robots.txt、NoAI元标签和反向代理拦截虽能影响爬虫，但难以完全阻止资源充足的爬虫。本研究探讨了当前网络工具保护创作者免受AI爬取的能力和效果。通过大规模测量和对203名职业艺术家的调查发现，尽管艺术家对robots.txt等工具有强烈需求，但受限于技术认知、部署能力和工具对不响应爬虫的有限效果。反向代理提供的网络级拦截虽防护更强，但部署较少且存在局限性。
