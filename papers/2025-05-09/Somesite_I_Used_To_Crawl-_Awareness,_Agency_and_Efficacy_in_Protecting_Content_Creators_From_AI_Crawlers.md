# Somesite I Used To Crawl: Awareness, Agency and Efficacy in Protecting Content Creators From AI Crawlers

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15091v2

## 原始摘要

The success of generative AI relies heavily on training on data scraped
through extensive crawling of the Internet, a practice that has raised
significant copyright, privacy, and ethical concerns. While few measures are
designed to resist a resource-rich adversary determined to scrape a site,
crawlers can be impacted by a range of existing tools such as robots.txt, NoAI
meta tags, and active crawler blocking by reverse proxies.
  In this work, we seek to understand the ability and efficacy of today's
networking tools to protect content creators against AI-related crawling. For
targeted populations like human artists, do they have the technical knowledge
and agency to utilize crawler-blocking tools such as robots.txt, and can such
tools be effective? Using large scale measurements and a targeted user study of
203 professional artists, we find strong demand for tools like robots.txt, but
significantly constrained by critical hurdles in technical awareness, agency in
deploying them, and limited efficacy against unresponsive crawlers. We further
test and evaluate network-level crawler blockers provided by reverse proxies.
Despite relatively limited deployment today, they offer stronger protections
against AI crawlers, but still come with their own set of limitations.


## AI 摘要

当前生成式AI依赖网络爬取数据训练，引发版权、隐私和伦理争议。虽然robots.txt、NoAI标签和反向代理拦截等技术可限制爬虫，但实际效果存疑。一项针对203名专业艺术家的研究发现，尽管创作者对拦截工具需求强烈，但受限于技术认知不足、部署权限缺失及对不响应爬虫的防护有限。网络层拦截（如反向代理）虽能提供更强保护，但目前部署较少且存在局限性。研究表明，现有工具在保护创作者免受AI爬取方面仍面临技术认知、实施难度及防护效能的重大挑战。
