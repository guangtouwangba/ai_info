# Somesite I Used To Crawl: Awareness, Agency and Efficacy in Protecting Content Creators From AI Crawlers

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15091v2

## 原始摘要

The success of generative AI relies heavily on training on data scraped
through extensive crawling of the Internet, a practice that has raised
significant copyright, privacy, and ethical concerns. While few measures are
designed to resist a resource-rich adversary determined to scrape a site,
crawlers can be impacted by a range of existing tools such as robots.txt, NoAI
meta tags, and active crawler blocking by reverse proxies.
  In this work, we seek to understand the ability and efficacy of today's
networking tools to protect content creators against AI-related crawling. For
targeted populations like human artists, do they have the technical knowledge
and agency to utilize crawler-blocking tools such as robots.txt, and can such
tools be effective? Using large scale measurements and a targeted user study of
203 professional artists, we find strong demand for tools like robots.txt, but
significantly constrained by critical hurdles in technical awareness, agency in
deploying them, and limited efficacy against unresponsive crawlers. We further
test and evaluate network-level crawler blockers provided by reverse proxies.
Despite relatively limited deployment today, they offer stronger protections
against AI crawlers, but still come with their own set of limitations.


## AI 摘要

当前生成式AI依赖网络爬取数据训练，但引发版权、隐私和伦理争议。现有工具如robots.txt、NoAI元标签和反向代理可限制爬取，但效果有限。研究调查了网络工具保护创作者免受AI爬取的能力，特别针对艺术家群体。大规模测量和203位专业艺术家的调研显示，虽然对这类工具有强烈需求，但受限于技术认知、部署能力和对不响应爬虫的防护不足。反向代理提供的网络级拦截虽更有效，但部署较少且存在局限性。研究揭示了当前防护工具的不足与挑战。
