# Supporting Construction Worker Well-Being with a Multi-Agent Conversational AI System

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07997v1

## 原始摘要

The construction industry is characterized by both high physical and
psychological risks, yet supports of mental health remain limited. While
advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language
models (LLMs), offer promising solutions, their potential in construction
remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we developed a
conversational multi-agent system that addresses industry-specific challenges
through an AI-driven approach integrated with domain knowledge. In parallel, it
fulfills construction workers' basic psychological needs by enabling
interactions with multiple agents, each has a distinct persona. This approach
ensures that workers receive both practical problem-solving support and social
engagement, ultimately contributing to their overall well-being. We evaluate
its usability and effectiveness through a within-subjects user study with 12
participants. The results show that our system significantly outperforms the
single-agent baseline, achieving improvements of 18% in usability, 40% in
self-determination, 60% in social presence, and 60% in trust. These findings
highlight the promise of LLM-driven AI systems in providing domain-specific
support for construction workers.


## AI 摘要

建筑行业存在较高身心风险，但心理健康支持不足。本研究开发了一个结合领域知识的对话式多智能体AI系统，通过不同角色的智能体交互，既解决实际问题又满足工人心理需求。针对12名参与者的对比测试显示，该系统显著优于单智能体基线：可用性提升18%，自主性提高40%，社交临场感与信任度各提升60%。结果表明，基于大语言模型的AI系统能有效为建筑工人提供专业支持，兼顾实用性与心理健康。研究成果为AI在建筑行业的心理健康应用提供了新思路。
