# The Decoupled Risk Landscape in Performative Prediction

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09044v1

## 原始摘要

Performative Prediction addresses scenarios where deploying a model induces a
distribution shift in the input data, such as individuals modifying their
features and reapplying for a bank loan after rejection. Literature has had a
theoretical perspective giving mathematical guarantees for convergence (either
to the stable or optimal point). We believe that visualization of the loss
landscape can complement this theoretical advances with practical insights.
Therefore, (1) we introduce a simple decoupled risk visualization method
inspired in the two-step process that performative prediction is. Our approach
visualizes the risk landscape with respect to two parameter vectors: model
parameters and data parameters. We use this method to propose new properties of
the interest points, to examine how existing algorithms traverse the risk
landscape and perform under more realistic conditions, including strategic
classification with non-linear models. (2) Building on this decoupled risk
visualization, we introduce a novel setting - extended Performative Prediction
- which captures scenarios where the distribution reacts to a model different
from the decision-making one, reflecting the reality that agents often lack
full access to the deployed model.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种针对"表演性预测"（模型部署引发数据分布偏移）的可视化分析方法。研究者开发了一种解耦风险可视化技术，将模型参数和数据参数分开呈现，用于分析现有算法在风险景观中的轨迹及非线性战略分类等实际场景下的表现。基于此方法，作者进一步提出"扩展表演性预测"新框架，用于描述现实场景中数据分布可能受到非决策模型影响的情况（如用户无法完全获取部署模型信息）。该研究通过可视化手段为表演性预测的理论成果提供了实践视角的补充。
