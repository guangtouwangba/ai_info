# The Decoupled Risk Landscape in Performative Prediction

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09044v1

## 原始摘要

Performative Prediction addresses scenarios where deploying a model induces a
distribution shift in the input data, such as individuals modifying their
features and reapplying for a bank loan after rejection. Literature has had a
theoretical perspective giving mathematical guarantees for convergence (either
to the stable or optimal point). We believe that visualization of the loss
landscape can complement this theoretical advances with practical insights.
Therefore, (1) we introduce a simple decoupled risk visualization method
inspired in the two-step process that performative prediction is. Our approach
visualizes the risk landscape with respect to two parameter vectors: model
parameters and data parameters. We use this method to propose new properties of
the interest points, to examine how existing algorithms traverse the risk
landscape and perform under more realistic conditions, including strategic
classification with non-linear models. (2) Building on this decoupled risk
visualization, we introduce a novel setting - extended Performative Prediction
- which captures scenarios where the distribution reacts to a model different
from the decision-making one, reflecting the reality that agents often lack
full access to the deployed model.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文提出了"表演性预测"的可视化方法，用于研究模型部署引发的数据分布偏移问题。作者开发了一种解耦风险可视化技术，通过分离模型参数和数据参数来展示风险景观，从而揭示关键点的特性并分析现有算法的表现。基于此，研究进一步扩展了表演性预测框架，提出"扩展表演性预测"新场景，用于模拟现实世界中决策模型与数据分布反应模型不一致的情况。这种方法为理论分析提供了实用视角，特别适用于非线性模型的战略分类等实际场景。
