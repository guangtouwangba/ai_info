# The Decoupled Risk Landscape in Performative Prediction

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09044v1

## 原始摘要

Performative Prediction addresses scenarios where deploying a model induces a
distribution shift in the input data, such as individuals modifying their
features and reapplying for a bank loan after rejection. Literature has had a
theoretical perspective giving mathematical guarantees for convergence (either
to the stable or optimal point). We believe that visualization of the loss
landscape can complement this theoretical advances with practical insights.
Therefore, (1) we introduce a simple decoupled risk visualization method
inspired in the two-step process that performative prediction is. Our approach
visualizes the risk landscape with respect to two parameter vectors: model
parameters and data parameters. We use this method to propose new properties of
the interest points, to examine how existing algorithms traverse the risk
landscape and perform under more realistic conditions, including strategic
classification with non-linear models. (2) Building on this decoupled risk
visualization, we introduce a novel setting - extended Performative Prediction
- which captures scenarios where the distribution reacts to a model different
from the decision-making one, reflecting the reality that agents often lack
full access to the deployed model.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种可视化方法研究"表演性预测"问题，即模型部署会引发输入数据分布偏移的现象（如银行拒贷后客户修改特征重新申请）。研究包含两部分：(1) 提出解耦风险可视化方法，通过分离模型参数和数据参数来展示风险景观，用于分析现有算法在非线性战略分类等现实场景中的表现；(2) 扩展表演性预测框架，研究当数据分布响应于非决策模型时的场景（反映现实中被试者通常无法完全获取部署模型的情况）。该方法为理论收敛保证提供了实践视角的补充。
