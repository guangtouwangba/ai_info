# The Decoupled Risk Landscape in Performative Prediction

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09044v1

## 原始摘要

Performative Prediction addresses scenarios where deploying a model induces a
distribution shift in the input data, such as individuals modifying their
features and reapplying for a bank loan after rejection. Literature has had a
theoretical perspective giving mathematical guarantees for convergence (either
to the stable or optimal point). We believe that visualization of the loss
landscape can complement this theoretical advances with practical insights.
Therefore, (1) we introduce a simple decoupled risk visualization method
inspired in the two-step process that performative prediction is. Our approach
visualizes the risk landscape with respect to two parameter vectors: model
parameters and data parameters. We use this method to propose new properties of
the interest points, to examine how existing algorithms traverse the risk
landscape and perform under more realistic conditions, including strategic
classification with non-linear models. (2) Building on this decoupled risk
visualization, we introduce a novel setting - extended Performative Prediction
- which captures scenarios where the distribution reacts to a model different
from the decision-making one, reflecting the reality that agents often lack
full access to the deployed model.

本文探讨了Performative Prediction（表演性预测）场景，即模型部署引发输入数据分布变化的问题（如贷款被拒后用户修改特征重新申请）。现有研究多聚焦理论收敛性，而本文提出通过可视化损失景观提供实践洞见：(1) 引入解耦风险可视化方法，将模型参数与数据参数分开呈现，用于分析算法路径及非线性战略分类场景；(2) 提出扩展表演性预测框架，模拟现实场景中智能体无法完全访问决策模型的情况。该方法揭示了关键点新特性，并为算法在更真实条件下的表现提供了评估工具。（99字）
