# The Decoupled Risk Landscape in Performative Prediction

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09044v1

## 原始摘要

Performative Prediction addresses scenarios where deploying a model induces a
distribution shift in the input data, such as individuals modifying their
features and reapplying for a bank loan after rejection. Literature has had a
theoretical perspective giving mathematical guarantees for convergence (either
to the stable or optimal point). We believe that visualization of the loss
landscape can complement this theoretical advances with practical insights.
Therefore, (1) we introduce a simple decoupled risk visualization method
inspired in the two-step process that performative prediction is. Our approach
visualizes the risk landscape with respect to two parameter vectors: model
parameters and data parameters. We use this method to propose new properties of
the interest points, to examine how existing algorithms traverse the risk
landscape and perform under more realistic conditions, including strategic
classification with non-linear models. (2) Building on this decoupled risk
visualization, we introduce a novel setting - extended Performative Prediction
- which captures scenarios where the distribution reacts to a model different
from the decision-making one, reflecting the reality that agents often lack
full access to the deployed model.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了"表演性预测"问题，即模型部署会引发输入数据分布变化的情况。研究提出了一种解耦风险可视化方法，通过分离模型参数和数据参数来展示风险景观，从而补充现有理论成果。该方法可用于分析现有算法在非线性模型等更现实条件下的表现。基于此，作者进一步提出"扩展表演性预测"的新场景，考虑代理无法完全访问部署模型时的情况。该研究通过可视化手段为表演性预测提供了实践洞见，并拓展了相关理论框架。
