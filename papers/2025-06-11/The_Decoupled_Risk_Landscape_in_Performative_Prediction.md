# The Decoupled Risk Landscape in Performative Prediction

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09044v1

## 原始摘要

Performative Prediction addresses scenarios where deploying a model induces a
distribution shift in the input data, such as individuals modifying their
features and reapplying for a bank loan after rejection. Literature has had a
theoretical perspective giving mathematical guarantees for convergence (either
to the stable or optimal point). We believe that visualization of the loss
landscape can complement this theoretical advances with practical insights.
Therefore, (1) we introduce a simple decoupled risk visualization method
inspired in the two-step process that performative prediction is. Our approach
visualizes the risk landscape with respect to two parameter vectors: model
parameters and data parameters. We use this method to propose new properties of
the interest points, to examine how existing algorithms traverse the risk
landscape and perform under more realistic conditions, including strategic
classification with non-linear models. (2) Building on this decoupled risk
visualization, we introduce a novel setting - extended Performative Prediction
- which captures scenarios where the distribution reacts to a model different
from the decision-making one, reflecting the reality that agents often lack
full access to the deployed model.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种可视化方法来研究"表演性预测"问题，即模型部署会引发输入数据分布变化的现象。研究者开发了一种解耦风险可视化技术，通过分离模型参数和数据参数来展示风险景观，从而揭示关键点的特性并分析现有算法的表现。该方法适用于非线性模型的战略分类等更现实场景。基于此，作者进一步提出了"扩展表演性预测"的新设定，用于描述分布对非决策模型的反应情况，更贴近现实中决策者无法完全获取部署模型的实际情况。这些工作为理论保证提供了实践视角的补充。
