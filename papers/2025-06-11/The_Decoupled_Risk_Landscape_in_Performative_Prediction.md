# The Decoupled Risk Landscape in Performative Prediction

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09044v1

## 原始摘要

Performative Prediction addresses scenarios where deploying a model induces a
distribution shift in the input data, such as individuals modifying their
features and reapplying for a bank loan after rejection. Literature has had a
theoretical perspective giving mathematical guarantees for convergence (either
to the stable or optimal point). We believe that visualization of the loss
landscape can complement this theoretical advances with practical insights.
Therefore, (1) we introduce a simple decoupled risk visualization method
inspired in the two-step process that performative prediction is. Our approach
visualizes the risk landscape with respect to two parameter vectors: model
parameters and data parameters. We use this method to propose new properties of
the interest points, to examine how existing algorithms traverse the risk
landscape and perform under more realistic conditions, including strategic
classification with non-linear models. (2) Building on this decoupled risk
visualization, we introduce a novel setting - extended Performative Prediction
- which captures scenarios where the distribution reacts to a model different
from the decision-making one, reflecting the reality that agents often lack
full access to the deployed model.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种可视化方法研究"表演性预测"问题，即模型部署导致输入数据分布偏移的现象。作者开发了一种解耦风险可视化技术，通过分离模型参数和数据参数来展示损失景观，从而补充现有理论分析。该方法揭示了关键点的新特性，并评估了现有算法在非线性战略分类等实际场景中的表现。基于此，作者进一步提出"扩展表演性预测"新框架，模拟现实中决策模型与数据分布反应模型不一致的情况。这些工作为理解模型部署引发的动态反馈效应提供了实用工具和理论扩展。
