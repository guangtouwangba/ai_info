# Applied Sheaf Theory For Multi-agent Artificial Intelligence (Reinforcement Learning) Systems: A Prospectus

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17700v1

## 原始摘要

This paper provides a pedagogical introduction to classical sheaf theory and
sheaf cohomology, followed by a research prospectus exploring potential
applications to multi-agent artificial intelligence systems. The first section
offers a comprehensive overview of fundamental sheaf-theoretic
concepts-presheaves, sheaves, stalks, and cohomology-aimed at researchers in
computer science and AI who may not have extensive background in algebraic
topology. The second section presents a detailed research prospectus that
outlines a roadmap for developing sheaf-theoretic approaches to model and
analyze complex systems of interacting agents. We propose that sheaf theory's
inherent local-to-global perspective may provide valuable mathematical tools
for reasoning about how local agent behaviors collectively determine emergent
system properties. The third section contains a literature review connecting
sheaf theory with existing research in multi-agent systems, reinforcement
learning, and economic modeling. This paper does not present a completed model
but rather lays theoretical groundwork and identifies promising research
directions that could bridge abstract mathematics with practical AI
applications, potentially revealing new approaches to coordination and
emergence in multi-agent systems.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文分为三个部分：首先用教学方式介绍了层论(Sheaf Theory)和层上同调的基本概念，面向缺乏代数拓扑背景的计算机科学和AI研究者；其次提出了将层论应用于多智能体系统的研究路线图，认为其"局部到整体"的视角有助于分析智能体局部行为如何涌现系统特性；最后综述了层论与多智能体系统、强化学习和经济模型的现有研究关联。论文旨在为层论与AI应用的结合奠定理论基础，指明可能的研究方向，为多智能体系统的协调与涌现现象提供新的数学工具和分析框架。
