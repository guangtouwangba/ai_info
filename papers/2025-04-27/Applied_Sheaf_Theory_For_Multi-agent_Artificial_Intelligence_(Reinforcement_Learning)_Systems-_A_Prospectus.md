# Applied Sheaf Theory For Multi-agent Artificial Intelligence (Reinforcement Learning) Systems: A Prospectus

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17700v1

## 原始摘要

This paper provides a pedagogical introduction to classical sheaf theory and
sheaf cohomology, followed by a research prospectus exploring potential
applications to multi-agent artificial intelligence systems. The first section
offers a comprehensive overview of fundamental sheaf-theoretic
concepts-presheaves, sheaves, stalks, and cohomology-aimed at researchers in
computer science and AI who may not have extensive background in algebraic
topology. The second section presents a detailed research prospectus that
outlines a roadmap for developing sheaf-theoretic approaches to model and
analyze complex systems of interacting agents. We propose that sheaf theory's
inherent local-to-global perspective may provide valuable mathematical tools
for reasoning about how local agent behaviors collectively determine emergent
system properties. The third section contains a literature review connecting
sheaf theory with existing research in multi-agent systems, reinforcement
learning, and economic modeling. This paper does not present a completed model
but rather lays theoretical groundwork and identifies promising research
directions that could bridge abstract mathematics with practical AI
applications, potentially revealing new approaches to coordination and
emergence in multi-agent systems.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文首先介绍了层论和层上同调的基本概念（预层、层、茎等），为计算机科学和AI研究者提供入门教程。随后提出研究展望，探讨层论在多智能体系统中的应用潜力，认为其"局部到整体"的视角有助于分析智能体局部行为如何涌现系统全局特性。论文还综述了层论与多智能体系统、强化学习和经济模型的现有研究联系。虽然未提出完整模型，但为连接抽象数学与AI实践奠定了理论基础，指明了可能带来多智能体系统协调与涌现研究新思路的方向。
