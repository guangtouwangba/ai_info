# The Role of Prescreening in Auctions with Predictions

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12117v2

## 原始摘要

Auctioneers often use closed auctions to create scarcity and prestige, aiming
to intensify competition among a select group of high-status bidders. Advances
in machine learning and AI make this strategy increasingly viable, enabling
cost-effective identification of capable participants. In this paper, we
develop a theoretical model to assess whether such practice can be justified
from an economic perspective. We consider a setting in which bidders have
i.i.d. private valuations, and the auction designer observes a noisy predictor
of each bidder's valuation, which is assumed to be fully informative with some
probability. Based on this noisy predictor, the designer determines how many
bidders to admit -- a process we refer to as prescreening. We show that an
auction with prescreening is equivalent to a standard auction (i.e., without
prescreening) in which bidder valuations are correlated. Notably, the standard
notion of affiliation commonly assumed in the auction literature does not
generally hold in this equivalent formulation. We characterize conditions for
the existence of symmetric and strictly monotone equilibrium strategies across
three classical auction formats: all-pay, first-price, and second-price
auctions. Our results demonstrate that prescreening with noisy predictors can
significantly enhance revenue in all-pay auctions; in fact, with a perfect
predictor, admitting only two bidders is optimal. By contrast, in both
first-price and second-price auctions, admitting all bidders remains
revenue-maximizing.


## AI 摘要

本文通过理论模型分析了拍卖中预筛选竞标者的经济合理性。研究发现，基于噪声预测器的预筛选机制相当于标准拍卖中竞标者估值存在相关性，但不符合传统关联性假设。研究比较了全支付、第一价格和第二价格三种拍卖形式，发现预筛选能显著提升全支付拍卖的收益（完美预测时仅需2名竞标者），但在第一价格和第二价格拍卖中，允许所有竞标者参与仍是最优策略。这表明拍卖形式对预筛选效果具有关键影响，为拍卖设计中的选择性准入策略提供了理论依据。（99字）
