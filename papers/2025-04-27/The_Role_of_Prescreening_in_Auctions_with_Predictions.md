# The Role of Prescreening in Auctions with Predictions

## 原始摘要

Auctioneers often use closed auctions to create scarcity and prestige, aiming
to intensify competition among a select group of high-status bidders. Advances
in machine learning and AI make this strategy increasingly viable, enabling
cost-effective identification of capable participants. In this paper, we
develop a theoretical model to assess whether such practice can be justified
from an economic perspective. We consider a setting in which bidders have
i.i.d. private valuations, and the auction designer observes a noisy predictor
of each bidder's valuation, which is assumed to be fully informative with some
probability. Based on this noisy predictor, the designer determines how many
bidders to admit -- a process we refer to as prescreening. We show that an
auction with prescreening is equivalent to a standard auction (i.e., without
prescreening) in which bidder valuations are correlated. Notably, the standard
notion of affiliation commonly assumed in the auction literature does not
generally hold in this equivalent formulation. We characterize conditions for
the existence of symmetric and strictly monotone equilibrium strategies across
three classical auction formats: all-pay, first-price, and second-price
auctions. Our results demonstrate that prescreening with noisy predictors can
significantly enhance revenue in all-pay auctions; in fact, with a perfect
predictor, admitting only two bidders is optimal. By contrast, in both
first-price and second-price auctions, admitting all bidders remains
revenue-maximizing.


## AI 摘要

本文研究了拍卖中通过预筛选（prescreening）策略选择竞标者的经济合理性。模型假设竞标者具有独立同分布的私人估值，拍卖设计者通过有噪声的估值预测器筛选竞标者数量。研究发现：预筛选拍卖等价于估值相关的标准拍卖，但不符合传统关联性假设。在三种经典拍卖形式中，预筛选能显著提高全支付拍卖（all-pay）的收益（完美预测时仅需2位竞标者即可最优），但对第一价格和第二价格拍卖而言，允许所有竞标者参与仍是收益最大化的选择。研究揭示了不同拍卖机制下预筛选策略的差异化效果。
