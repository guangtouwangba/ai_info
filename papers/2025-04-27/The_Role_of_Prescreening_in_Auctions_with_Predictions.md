# The Role of Prescreening in Auctions with Predictions

## 原始摘要

Auctioneers often use closed auctions to create scarcity and prestige, aiming
to intensify competition among a select group of high-status bidders. Advances
in machine learning and AI make this strategy increasingly viable, enabling
cost-effective identification of capable participants. In this paper, we
develop a theoretical model to assess whether such practice can be justified
from an economic perspective. We consider a setting in which bidders have
i.i.d. private valuations, and the auction designer observes a noisy predictor
of each bidder's valuation, which is assumed to be fully informative with some
probability. Based on this noisy predictor, the designer determines how many
bidders to admit -- a process we refer to as prescreening. We show that an
auction with prescreening is equivalent to a standard auction (i.e., without
prescreening) in which bidder valuations are correlated. Notably, the standard
notion of affiliation commonly assumed in the auction literature does not
generally hold in this equivalent formulation. We characterize conditions for
the existence of symmetric and strictly monotone equilibrium strategies across
three classical auction formats: all-pay, first-price, and second-price
auctions. Our results demonstrate that prescreening with noisy predictors can
significantly enhance revenue in all-pay auctions; in fact, with a perfect
predictor, admitting only two bidders is optimal. By contrast, in both
first-price and second-price auctions, admitting all bidders remains
revenue-maximizing.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了拍卖方利用机器学习筛选竞拍者（预筛选）的经济合理性。在竞拍者估价独立同分布且拍卖方掌握估值噪声预测信号的设定下，研究发现：预筛选拍卖等价于标准拍卖中竞拍者估价相关的场景。研究确定了全支付拍卖、第一价格拍卖和第二价格拍卖中对称严格单调均衡策略的存在条件。关键结论显示，预筛选能显著提升全支付拍卖收益（完美预测时仅需准入两位竞拍者即最优），但对第一和第二价格拍卖，允许所有竞拍者入场仍是最优策略。这为差异化拍卖设计提供了理论依据。
