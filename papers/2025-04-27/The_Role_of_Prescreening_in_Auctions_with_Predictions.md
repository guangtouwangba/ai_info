# The Role of Prescreening in Auctions with Predictions

## 原始摘要

Auctioneers often use closed auctions to create scarcity and prestige, aiming
to intensify competition among a select group of high-status bidders. Advances
in machine learning and AI make this strategy increasingly viable, enabling
cost-effective identification of capable participants. In this paper, we
develop a theoretical model to assess whether such practice can be justified
from an economic perspective. We consider a setting in which bidders have
i.i.d. private valuations, and the auction designer observes a noisy predictor
of each bidder's valuation, which is assumed to be fully informative with some
probability. Based on this noisy predictor, the designer determines how many
bidders to admit -- a process we refer to as prescreening. We show that an
auction with prescreening is equivalent to a standard auction (i.e., without
prescreening) in which bidder valuations are correlated. Notably, the standard
notion of affiliation commonly assumed in the auction literature does not
generally hold in this equivalent formulation. We characterize conditions for
the existence of symmetric and strictly monotone equilibrium strategies across
three classical auction formats: all-pay, first-price, and second-price
auctions. Our results demonstrate that prescreening with noisy predictors can
significantly enhance revenue in all-pay auctions; in fact, with a perfect
predictor, admitting only two bidders is optimal. By contrast, in both
first-price and second-price auctions, admitting all bidders remains
revenue-maximizing.


## AI 摘要

拍卖行常采用封闭拍卖制造稀缺性和提升声望，以刺激高价值竞标者间的竞争。本文通过理论模型分析，探讨基于机器学习预筛选择优录取竞标者的经济合理性。研究表明：预筛查拍卖等价于竞标者估值相关的标准拍卖，但传统关联性假设不成立。在三种经典拍卖形式中，预筛查能显著提升全支付拍卖收益（完美预测时仅需录取两人），但在第一价格和第二价格拍卖中，录取所有竞标者仍是最优策略。这为拍卖设计中的选择性准入策略提供了理论依据。
