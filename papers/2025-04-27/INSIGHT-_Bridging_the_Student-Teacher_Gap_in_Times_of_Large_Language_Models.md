# INSIGHT: Bridging the Student-Teacher Gap in Times of Large Language Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17677v1

## 原始摘要

The rise of AI, especially Large Language Models, presents challenges and
opportunities to integrate such technology into the classroom. AI has the
potential to revolutionize education by helping teaching staff with various
tasks, such as personalizing their teaching methods, but it also raises
concerns, for example, about the degradation of student-teacher interactions
and user privacy. This paper introduces INSIGHT, a proof of concept to combine
various AI tools to assist teaching staff and students in the process of
solving exercises. INSIGHT has a modular design that allows it to be integrated
into various higher education courses. We analyze students' questions to an LLM
by extracting keywords, which we use to dynamically build an FAQ from students'
questions and provide new insights for the teaching staff to use for more
personalized face-to-face support. Future work could build upon INSIGHT by
using the collected data to provide adaptive learning and adjust content based
on student progress and learning styles to offer a more interactive and
inclusive learning experience.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文介绍了INSIGHT概念验证系统，旨在将多种AI工具整合到高等教育中，辅助师生解决习题。该系统采用模块化设计，可适配不同课程。通过分析学生向大语言模型提出的问题并提取关键词，INSIGHT能动态构建常见问题解答库，同时为教师提供个性化面授支持的参考依据。研究指出，AI在教育领域既能革新教学方式（如个性化教学），也带来师生互动减少和隐私问题等挑战。未来可基于该系统收集的数据，开发自适应学习功能，根据学生进度和学习风格调整内容，创造更具互动性和包容性的学习体验。（99字）
