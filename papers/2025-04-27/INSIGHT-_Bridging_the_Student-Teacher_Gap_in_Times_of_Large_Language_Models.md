# INSIGHT: Bridging the Student-Teacher Gap in Times of Large Language Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17677v1

## 原始摘要

The rise of AI, especially Large Language Models, presents challenges and
opportunities to integrate such technology into the classroom. AI has the
potential to revolutionize education by helping teaching staff with various
tasks, such as personalizing their teaching methods, but it also raises
concerns, for example, about the degradation of student-teacher interactions
and user privacy. This paper introduces INSIGHT, a proof of concept to combine
various AI tools to assist teaching staff and students in the process of
solving exercises. INSIGHT has a modular design that allows it to be integrated
into various higher education courses. We analyze students' questions to an LLM
by extracting keywords, which we use to dynamically build an FAQ from students'
questions and provide new insights for the teaching staff to use for more
personalized face-to-face support. Future work could build upon INSIGHT by
using the collected data to provide adaptive learning and adjust content based
on student progress and learning styles to offer a more interactive and
inclusive learning experience.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文介绍了INSIGHT系统，这是一个整合多种AI工具来辅助师生解决课堂练习的概念验证项目。INSIGHT采用模块化设计，可适配不同高等教育课程。系统通过分析学生向大语言模型（LLM）提出的问题，提取关键词动态构建FAQ知识库，同时为教师提供个性化面授的参考依据。该技术既展现了AI在教育领域个性化教学的潜力，也需应对师生互动弱化等挑战。未来可通过收集的学习数据实现自适应教学，根据学生进度和风格调整内容，创造更具交互性和包容性的学习体验。
