# Conversational Assistants to support Heart Failure Patients: comparing a Neurosymbolic Architecture with ChatGPT

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17753v1

## 原始摘要

Conversational assistants are becoming more and more popular, including in
healthcare, partly because of the availability and capabilities of Large
Language Models. There is a need for controlled, probing evaluations with real
stakeholders which can highlight advantages and disadvantages of more
traditional architectures and those based on generative AI. We present a
within-group user study to compare two versions of a conversational assistant
that allows heart failure patients to ask about salt content in food. One
version of the system was developed in-house with a neurosymbolic architecture,
and one is based on ChatGPT. The evaluation shows that the in-house system is
more accurate, completes more tasks and is less verbose than the one based on
ChatGPT; on the other hand, the one based on ChatGPT makes fewer speech errors
and requires fewer clarifications to complete the task. Patients show no
preference for one over the other.


## AI 摘要

研究人员比较了两种针对心衰患者的对话助手：一种基于神经符号架构的自主研发系统，另一种基于ChatGPT。研究发现，自主研发系统更准确、完成任务更多且回答更简洁，而ChatGPT版本语音错误更少、任务完成所需澄清更少。患者对两种系统无明显偏好。该研究揭示了传统架构与生成式AI在医疗助手中的优缺点，为相关应用开发提供了参考。
