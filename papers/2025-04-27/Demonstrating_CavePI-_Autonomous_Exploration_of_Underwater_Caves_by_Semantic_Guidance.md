# Demonstrating CavePI: Autonomous Exploration of Underwater Caves by Semantic Guidance

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05384v4

## 原始摘要

Enabling autonomous robots to safely and efficiently navigate, explore, and
map underwater caves is of significant importance to water resource management,
hydrogeology, archaeology, and marine robotics. In this work, we demonstrate
the system design and algorithmic integration of a visual servoing framework
for semantically guided autonomous underwater cave exploration. We present the
hardware and edge-AI design considerations to deploy this framework on a novel
AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) named CavePI. The guided navigation is
driven by a computationally light yet robust deep visual perception module,
delivering a rich semantic understanding of the environment. Subsequently, a
robust control mechanism enables CavePI to track the semantic guides and
navigate within complex cave structures. We evaluate the system through field
experiments in natural underwater caves and spring-water sites and further
validate its ROS (Robot Operating System)-based digital twin in a simulation
environment. Our results highlight how these integrated design choices
facilitate reliable navigation under feature-deprived, GPS-denied, and
low-visibility conditions.


## AI 摘要

本文介绍了用于水下洞穴自主探索的视觉伺服系统CavePI，集成了轻量化深度视觉感知模块和鲁棒控制机制，可在GPS失效、特征匮乏的低能见度环境中实现语义引导导航。该系统通过硬件与边缘AI设计优化，部署于新型AUV平台，并在真实水下洞穴和模拟环境中验证了性能。实验表明，该框架能有效解析环境语义信息，支持复杂洞穴结构的可靠导航，对水资源管理、考古及海洋机器人研究具有重要价值。
