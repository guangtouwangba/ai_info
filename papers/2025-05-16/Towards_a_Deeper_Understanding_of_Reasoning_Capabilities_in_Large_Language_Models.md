# Towards a Deeper Understanding of Reasoning Capabilities in Large Language Models

## 原始摘要

While large language models demonstrate impressive performance on static
benchmarks, the true potential of large language models as self-learning and
reasoning agents in dynamic environments remains unclear. This study
systematically evaluates the efficacy of self-reflection, heuristic mutation,
and planning as prompting techniques to test the adaptive capabilities of
agents. We conduct experiments with various open-source language models in
dynamic environments and find that larger models generally outperform smaller
ones, but that strategic prompting can close this performance gap. Second, a
too-long prompt can negatively impact smaller models on basic reactive tasks,
while larger models show more robust behaviour. Third, advanced prompting
techniques primarily benefit smaller models on complex games, but offer less
improvement for already high-performing large language models. Yet, we find
that advanced reasoning methods yield highly variable outcomes: while capable
of significantly improving performance when reasoning and decision-making
align, they also introduce instability and can lead to big performance drops.
Compared to human performance, our findings reveal little evidence of true
emergent reasoning. Instead, large language model performance exhibits
persistent limitations in crucial areas such as planning, reasoning, and
spatial coordination, suggesting that current-generation large language models
still suffer fundamental shortcomings that may not be fully overcome through
self-reflective prompting alone. Reasoning is a multi-faceted task, and while
reasoning methods like Chain of thought improves multi-step reasoning on math
word problems, our findings using dynamic benchmarks highlight important
shortcomings in general reasoning capabilities, indicating a need to move
beyond static benchmarks to capture the complexity of reasoning.


## AI 摘要

该研究评估了大语言模型在动态环境中的自适应能力，发现更大模型通常表现更好，但策略性提示能缩小性能差距。较长提示会损害小模型的基础反应任务表现，而大模型更稳健。复杂任务中，高级提示技术对小模型帮助更大，但对高性能大模型提升有限。推理方法虽能提升表现，但也导致不稳定，甚至性能骤降。相比人类，大语言模型在规划、推理和空间协调等关键领域仍有明显局限，表明当前模型存在根本性缺陷，仅靠自我反思提示无法完全克服。研究强调需超越静态基准，以全面评估推理能力。
