# Deontic Temporal Logic for Formal Verification of AI Ethics

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05765v2

## 原始摘要

Ensuring ethical behavior in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems amidst
their increasing ubiquity and influence is a major concern the world over. The
use of formal methods in AI ethics is a possible crucial approach for
specifying and verifying the ethical behavior of AI systems. This paper
proposes a formalization based on deontic logic to define and evaluate the
ethical behavior of AI systems, focusing on system-level specifications,
contributing to this important goal. It introduces axioms and theorems to
capture ethical requirements related to fairness and explainability. The
formalization incorporates temporal operators to reason about the ethical
behavior of AI systems over time. The authors evaluate the effectiveness of
this formalization by assessing the ethics of the real-world COMPAS and loan
prediction AI systems. Various ethical properties of the COMPAS and loan
prediction systems are encoded using deontic logical formulas, allowing the use
of an automated theorem prover to verify whether these systems satisfy the
defined properties. The formal verification reveals that both systems fail to
fulfill certain key ethical properties related to fairness and
non-discrimination, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed
formalization in identifying potential ethical issues in real-world AI
applications.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种基于道义逻辑的形式化方法，用于定义和评估AI系统的伦理行为，重点关注公平性和可解释性。研究者引入公理和定理来捕捉伦理要求，并使用时态算子分析AI系统随时间变化的伦理表现。通过将现实中的COMPAS和贷款预测系统的伦理属性编码为逻辑公式，并利用自动定理证明器验证其是否符合定义的伦理标准。形式化验证显示，这两个系统均未能满足某些关键的公平性和非歧视性伦理要求。该研究表明，所提出的形式化方法能有效识别实际AI应用中的潜在伦理问题。
