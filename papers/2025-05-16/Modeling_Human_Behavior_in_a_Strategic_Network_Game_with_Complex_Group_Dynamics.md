# Modeling Human Behavior in a Strategic Network Game with Complex Group Dynamics

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03795v2

## 原始摘要

Human networks greatly impact important societal outcomes, including wealth
and health inequality, poverty, and bullying. As such, understanding human
networks is critical to learning how to promote favorable societal outcomes. As
a step toward better understanding human networks, we compare and contrast
several methods for learning, from a small data set, models of human behavior
in a strategic network game called the Junior High Game (JHG). These modeling
methods differ with respect to the assumptions they use to parameterize human
behavior (behavior vs. community-aware behavior) and the moments they model
(mean vs. distribution). Results show that the highest-performing method,
called hCAB, models the distribution of human behavior rather than the mean and
assumes humans use community-aware behavior rather than behavior matching. When
applied to small societies (6-11 individuals), the hCAB model closely mirrors
the population dynamics of human groups (with notable differences).
Additionally, in a user study, human participants were unable to distinguish
individual hCAB agents from other humans, thus illustrating that the hCAB model
also produces plausible (individual) human behavior in this strategic network
game.


## AI 摘要

人类网络对社会不平等、贫困和欺凌等关键问题有重大影响。为更好地理解人类网络行为，研究比较了多种方法，用于从少量数据中学习人类在策略性网络游戏（Junior High Game, JHG）中的行为模型。其中，表现最佳的hCAB方法通过建模行为的分布（而非均值）并假设人类具有社区意识行为（而非简单行为匹配），在小规模群体（6-11人）中较好地复现了人类群体动态。用户研究还表明，人类参与者难以区分hCAB智能体与真实人类，验证了该模型在个体行为层面的合理性。
