# Modeling Human Behavior in a Strategic Network Game with Complex Group Dynamics

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03795v2

## 原始摘要

Human networks greatly impact important societal outcomes, including wealth
and health inequality, poverty, and bullying. As such, understanding human
networks is critical to learning how to promote favorable societal outcomes. As
a step toward better understanding human networks, we compare and contrast
several methods for learning, from a small data set, models of human behavior
in a strategic network game called the Junior High Game (JHG). These modeling
methods differ with respect to the assumptions they use to parameterize human
behavior (behavior vs. community-aware behavior) and the moments they model
(mean vs. distribution). Results show that the highest-performing method,
called hCAB, models the distribution of human behavior rather than the mean and
assumes humans use community-aware behavior rather than behavior matching. When
applied to small societies (6-11 individuals), the hCAB model closely mirrors
the population dynamics of human groups (with notable differences).
Additionally, in a user study, human participants were unable to distinguish
individual hCAB agents from other humans, thus illustrating that the hCAB model
also produces plausible (individual) human behavior in this strategic network
game.


## AI 摘要

人类网络对社会不平等、贫困和欺凌等关键问题有重大影响。为更好理解网络行为，研究比较了多种从小数据集中学习人类行为模型的方法，用于分析策略性网络游戏“初中游戏”（JHG）。最佳方法是hCAB模型，它通过社区感知行为（而非简单行为匹配）建模人类行为的分布（而非均值）。在小规模群体（6-11人）中，hCAB能准确反映群体动态，且用户实验表明人类参与者无法区分hCAB智能体与真人行为，验证了其个体行为模拟的真实性。
