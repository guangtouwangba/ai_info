# Modeling Human Behavior in a Strategic Network Game with Complex Group Dynamics

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03795v2

## 原始摘要

Human networks greatly impact important societal outcomes, including wealth
and health inequality, poverty, and bullying. As such, understanding human
networks is critical to learning how to promote favorable societal outcomes. As
a step toward better understanding human networks, we compare and contrast
several methods for learning, from a small data set, models of human behavior
in a strategic network game called the Junior High Game (JHG). These modeling
methods differ with respect to the assumptions they use to parameterize human
behavior (behavior vs. community-aware behavior) and the moments they model
(mean vs. distribution). Results show that the highest-performing method,
called hCAB, models the distribution of human behavior rather than the mean and
assumes humans use community-aware behavior rather than behavior matching. When
applied to small societies (6-11 individuals), the hCAB model closely mirrors
the population dynamics of human groups (with notable differences).
Additionally, in a user study, human participants were unable to distinguish
individual hCAB agents from other humans, thus illustrating that the hCAB model
also produces plausible (individual) human behavior in this strategic network
game.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了人类网络对社会不平等、贫困和欺凌等社会结果的影响，并提出了一种名为hCAB的建模方法，用于模拟人类在策略性网络游戏（Junior High Game）中的行为。hCAB通过建模人类行为的分布（而非均值）并假设人类具有社区意识行为（而非简单行为匹配），在小规模社会（6-11人）中能准确反映群体动态。实验表明，人类参与者无法区分hCAB模型生成的个体行为与真实人类行为，验证了其模拟个体行为的可信度。这一方法为理解人类网络行为提供了新工具。
