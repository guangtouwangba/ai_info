# Modeling Human Behavior in a Strategic Network Game with Complex Group Dynamics

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03795v2

## 原始摘要

Human networks greatly impact important societal outcomes, including wealth
and health inequality, poverty, and bullying. As such, understanding human
networks is critical to learning how to promote favorable societal outcomes. As
a step toward better understanding human networks, we compare and contrast
several methods for learning, from a small data set, models of human behavior
in a strategic network game called the Junior High Game (JHG). These modeling
methods differ with respect to the assumptions they use to parameterize human
behavior (behavior vs. community-aware behavior) and the moments they model
(mean vs. distribution). Results show that the highest-performing method,
called hCAB, models the distribution of human behavior rather than the mean and
assumes humans use community-aware behavior rather than behavior matching. When
applied to small societies (6-11 individuals), the hCAB model closely mirrors
the population dynamics of human groups (with notable differences).
Additionally, in a user study, human participants were unable to distinguish
individual hCAB agents from other humans, thus illustrating that the hCAB model
also produces plausible (individual) human behavior in this strategic network
game.


## AI 摘要

该研究比较了多种从小数据集中学习人类行为模型的方法，重点分析了策略性网络游戏"Junior High Game"中的行为模式。最佳方法hCAB通过建模行为分布（而非均值）并假设人类具有社区意识行为（而非单纯行为匹配），能准确反映小型社会群体(6-11人)的动态特征。用户研究显示，人类参与者无法区分hCAB智能体与真实人类行为，验证了该模型在个体层面也能产生可信的人类行为表现。这些发现为理解人类网络行为及其对社会不平等等重大议题的影响提供了新见解。
