# BizChat: Scaffolding AI-Powered Business Planning for Small Business Owners Across Digital Skill Levels

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08493v2

## 原始摘要

Generative AI can help small business owners automate tasks, increase
efficiency, and improve their bottom line. However, despite the seemingly
intuitive design of systems like ChatGPT, significant barriers remain for those
less comfortable with technology. To address these disparities, prior work
highlights accessory skills -- beyond prompt engineering -- users must master
to successfully adopt generative AI including keyboard shortcuts, editing
skills, file conversions, and browser literacy. Building on a design workshop
series and 15 interviews with small businesses, we introduce BizChat, a large
language model (LLM)-powered web application that helps business owners across
digital skills levels write their business plan -- an essential but often
neglected document. To do so, BizChat's interface embodies three design
considerations inspired by learning sciences: ensuring accessibility to users
with less digital skills while maintaining extensibility to power users
("low-floor-high-ceiling"), providing in situ micro-learning to support
entrepreneurial education ("just-in-time learning"), and framing interaction
around business activities ("contextualized technology introduction"). We
conclude with plans for a future BizChat deployment.


## AI 摘要

生成式AI能帮助小企业主自动化任务、提高效率并改善盈利。然而，尽管ChatGPT等系统看似直观，但对技术不熟悉的用户仍面临障碍。研究表明，除提示工程外，用户还需掌握键盘快捷键、编辑技能、文件转换和浏览器操作等辅助技能。基于设计研讨会和对15家小企业的访谈，研究者开发了BizChat——一个基于大语言模型的网页应用，帮助不同数字技能水平的用户撰写商业计划书。BizChat采用三个设计原则：低门槛高上限、即时微学习和情境化技术引入。未来计划进一步部署该应用。（98字）
