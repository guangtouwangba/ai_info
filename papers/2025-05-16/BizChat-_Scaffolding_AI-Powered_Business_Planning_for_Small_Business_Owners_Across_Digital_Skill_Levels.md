# BizChat: Scaffolding AI-Powered Business Planning for Small Business Owners Across Digital Skill Levels

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08493v2

## 原始摘要

Generative AI can help small business owners automate tasks, increase
efficiency, and improve their bottom line. However, despite the seemingly
intuitive design of systems like ChatGPT, significant barriers remain for those
less comfortable with technology. To address these disparities, prior work
highlights accessory skills -- beyond prompt engineering -- users must master
to successfully adopt generative AI including keyboard shortcuts, editing
skills, file conversions, and browser literacy. Building on a design workshop
series and 15 interviews with small businesses, we introduce BizChat, a large
language model (LLM)-powered web application that helps business owners across
digital skills levels write their business plan -- an essential but often
neglected document. To do so, BizChat's interface embodies three design
considerations inspired by learning sciences: ensuring accessibility to users
with less digital skills while maintaining extensibility to power users
("low-floor-high-ceiling"), providing in situ micro-learning to support
entrepreneurial education ("just-in-time learning"), and framing interaction
around business activities ("contextualized technology introduction"). We
conclude with plans for a future BizChat deployment.


## AI 摘要

生成式AI虽能帮助小企业主自动化任务、提升效率，但技术门槛仍是主要障碍。研究表明，除提示工程外，用户还需掌握快捷键、文件转换等数字技能。为此，研究者基于工作坊和15家小企业访谈，开发了LLM驱动的BizChat应用，通过低门槛高扩展性界面（低地板高天花板）、实时微学习（即时学习）和业务场景化交互（情境化技术引入）三项设计原则，帮助不同数字技能水平的用户撰写商业计划书。该研究为AI工具普惠化提供了实践方案，并计划进一步部署测试。
