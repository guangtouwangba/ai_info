# Challenges and Future Directions of Data-Centric AI Alignment

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01957v2

## 原始摘要

As AI systems become increasingly capable and influential, ensuring their
alignment with human values, preferences, and goals has become a critical
research focus. Current alignment methods primarily focus on designing
algorithms and loss functions but often underestimate the crucial role of data.
This paper advocates for a shift towards data-centric AI alignment, emphasizing
the need to enhance the quality and representativeness of data used in aligning
AI systems. In this position paper, we highlight key challenges associated with
both human-based and AI-based feedback within the data-centric alignment
framework. Through qualitative analysis, we identify multiple sources of
unreliability in human feedback, as well as problems related to temporal drift,
context dependence, and AI-based feedback failing to capture human values due
to inherent model limitations. We propose future research directions, including
improved feedback collection practices, robust data-cleaning methodologies, and
rigorous feedback verification processes. We call for future research into
these critical directions to ensure, addressing gaps that persist in
understanding and improving data-centric alignment practices.


## AI 摘要

本文主张以数据为中心的人工智能对齐方法，强调提升训练数据的质量和代表性对AI系统与人类价值观对齐的重要性。研究指出当前基于人类和AI反馈的数据对齐存在关键挑战：人类反馈存在可靠性问题，AI反馈则受时间漂移、情境依赖及模型固有局限影响，难以准确反映人类价值观。作者建议未来研究方向包括优化反馈收集流程、开发稳健的数据清洗方法，以及建立严格的反馈验证机制，以解决数据对齐实践中的关键缺陷。这一立场论文呼吁加强数据导向的对齐研究，填补现有认知与实践空白。
