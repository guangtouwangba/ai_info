# Challenges and Future Directions of Data-Centric AI Alignment

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01957v2

## 原始摘要

As AI systems become increasingly capable and influential, ensuring their
alignment with human values, preferences, and goals has become a critical
research focus. Current alignment methods primarily focus on designing
algorithms and loss functions but often underestimate the crucial role of data.
This paper advocates for a shift towards data-centric AI alignment, emphasizing
the need to enhance the quality and representativeness of data used in aligning
AI systems. In this position paper, we highlight key challenges associated with
both human-based and AI-based feedback within the data-centric alignment
framework. Through qualitative analysis, we identify multiple sources of
unreliability in human feedback, as well as problems related to temporal drift,
context dependence, and AI-based feedback failing to capture human values due
to inherent model limitations. We propose future research directions, including
improved feedback collection practices, robust data-cleaning methodologies, and
rigorous feedback verification processes. We call for future research into
these critical directions to ensure, addressing gaps that persist in
understanding and improving data-centric alignment practices.


## AI 摘要

随着AI系统能力增强，确保其与人类价值观对齐成为研究重点。当前方法主要关注算法设计，却低估了数据的关键作用。本文主张转向以数据为中心的AI对齐，强调提升数据质量和代表性。研究揭示了人类反馈的可靠性问题（如时间漂移、情境依赖）以及AI反馈因模型局限难以捕捉人类价值观的缺陷。未来研究方向包括改进反馈收集、开发鲁棒的数据清洗方法及严格验证流程，以填补数据对齐实践的认知空白。该立场论文呼吁学界关注这些关键领域，推动AI系统的价值校准。
