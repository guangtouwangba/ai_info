# Towards Autonomous Micromobility through Scalable Urban Simulation

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00690v1

## 原始摘要

Micromobility, which utilizes lightweight mobile machines moving in urban
public spaces, such as delivery robots and mobility scooters, emerges as a
promising alternative to vehicular mobility. Current micromobility depends
mostly on human manual operation (in-person or remote control), which raises
safety and efficiency concerns when navigating busy urban environments full of
unpredictable obstacles and pedestrians. Assisting humans with AI agents in
maneuvering micromobility devices presents a viable solution for enhancing
safety and efficiency. In this work, we present a scalable urban simulation
solution to advance autonomous micromobility. First, we build URBAN-SIM - a
high-performance robot learning platform for large-scale training of embodied
agents in interactive urban scenes. URBAN-SIM contains three critical modules:
Hierarchical Urban Generation pipeline, Interactive Dynamics Generation
strategy, and Asynchronous Scene Sampling scheme, to improve the diversity,
realism, and efficiency of robot learning in simulation. Then, we propose
URBAN-BENCH - a suite of essential tasks and benchmarks to gauge various
capabilities of the AI agents in achieving autonomous micromobility.
URBAN-BENCH includes eight tasks based on three core skills of the agents:
Urban Locomotion, Urban Navigation, and Urban Traverse. We evaluate four robots
with heterogeneous embodiments, such as the wheeled and legged robots, across
these tasks. Experiments on diverse terrains and urban structures reveal each
robot's strengths and limitations.


## AI 摘要

微出行（如送货机器人、电动代步车）是城市交通的新选择，但依赖人工操作存在安全与效率问题。研究提出通过AI代理辅助操作来优化性能，并开发了URBAN-SIM仿真平台，包含分层城市生成、交互动态生成和异步场景采样三大模块，提升训练多样性、真实性和效率。配套的URBAN-BENCH测试套件评估AI代理的三大核心能力（移动、导航、穿越），涵盖8项任务，测试了轮式/足式等不同机器人在多样化地形中的表现。实验揭示了各机器人在城市环境中的优劣势，为自主微出行发展提供了量化基准。（99字）
