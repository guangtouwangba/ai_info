# clem:todd: A Framework for the Systematic Benchmarking of LLM-Based Task-Oriented Dialogue System Realisations

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05445v1

## 原始摘要

The emergence of instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) has advanced
the field of dialogue systems, enabling both realistic user simulations and
robust multi-turn conversational agents. However, existing research often
evaluates these components in isolation-either focusing on a single user
simulator or a specific system design-limiting the generalisability of insights
across architectures and configurations. In this work, we propose clem todd
(chat-optimized LLMs for task-oriented dialogue systems development), a
flexible framework for systematically evaluating dialogue systems under
consistent conditions. clem todd enables detailed benchmarking across
combinations of user simulators and dialogue systems, whether existing models
from literature or newly developed ones. It supports plug-and-play integration
and ensures uniform datasets, evaluation metrics, and computational
constraints. We showcase clem todd's flexibility by re-evaluating existing
task-oriented dialogue systems within this unified setup and integrating three
newly proposed dialogue systems into the same evaluation pipeline. Our results
provide actionable insights into how architecture, scale, and prompting
strategies affect dialogue performance, offering practical guidance for
building efficient and effective conversational AI systems.


## AI 摘要

本文介绍了clem todd框架，旨在通过统一标准系统评估任务导向对话系统。该框架支持灵活集成不同用户模拟器和对话系统，确保一致的测试条件（数据集、评估指标和计算资源）。研究通过重新评估现有系统和整合三个新系统，分析了架构、模型规模和提示策略对对话性能的影响，为构建高效对话AI提供了实用指导。该框架解决了现有研究中评估孤立、结论泛化性不足的问题，推动了对话系统开发的标准化比较。
