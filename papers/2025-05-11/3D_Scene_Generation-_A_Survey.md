# 3D Scene Generation: A Survey

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05474v1

## 原始摘要

3D scene generation seeks to synthesize spatially structured, semantically
meaningful, and photorealistic environments for applications such as immersive
media, robotics, autonomous driving, and embodied AI. Early methods based on
procedural rules offered scalability but limited diversity. Recent advances in
deep generative models (e.g., GANs, diffusion models) and 3D representations
(e.g., NeRF, 3D Gaussians) have enabled the learning of real-world scene
distributions, improving fidelity, diversity, and view consistency. Recent
advances like diffusion models bridge 3D scene synthesis and photorealism by
reframing generation as image or video synthesis problems. This survey provides
a systematic overview of state-of-the-art approaches, organizing them into four
paradigms: procedural generation, neural 3D-based generation, image-based
generation, and video-based generation. We analyze their technical foundations,
trade-offs, and representative results, and review commonly used datasets,
evaluation protocols, and downstream applications. We conclude by discussing
key challenges in generation capacity, 3D representation, data and annotations,
and evaluation, and outline promising directions including higher fidelity,
physics-aware and interactive generation, and unified perception-generation
models. This review organizes recent advances in 3D scene generation and
highlights promising directions at the intersection of generative AI, 3D
vision, and embodied intelligence. To track ongoing developments, we maintain
an up-to-date project page:

## AI 摘要

3D场景生成技术旨在创建空间结构化、语义丰富且逼真的虚拟环境，应用于沉浸式媒体、机器人、自动驾驶等领域。早期基于程序规则的方法可扩展但多样性不足。随着深度生成模型（如GAN、扩散模型）和3D表示（如NeRF、3D高斯）的发展，真实场景分布的建模能力显著提升，改善了保真度、多样性和视角一致性。最新方法将3D合成重构为图像或视频生成问题。本文系统梳理了四大技术范式（程序生成、神经3D生成、图像/视频生成），分析其基础、优缺点及评估标准，并探讨了未来方向如高保真、物理感知和统一感知生成模型。
