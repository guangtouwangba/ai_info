## 原始摘要

Pumpkin leaf diseases are significant threats to agricultural productivity,
requiring a timely and precise diagnosis for effective management. Traditional
identification methods are laborious and susceptible to human error,
emphasizing the necessity for automated solutions. This study employs on the
"Pumpkin Leaf Disease Dataset", that comprises of 2000 high-resolution images
separated into five categories. Downy mildew, powdery mildew, mosaic disease,
bacterial leaf spot, and healthy leaves. The dataset was rigorously assembled
from several agricultural fields to ensure a strong representation for model
training. We explored many proficient deep learning architectures, including
DenseNet201, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, Xception, ResNet50, ResNet101 and
InceptionResNetV2, and observed that ResNet50 performed most effectively, with
an accuracy of 90.5% and comparable precision, recall, and F1-Score. We used
Explainable AI (XAI) approaches like Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, Score-CAM, and
Layer-CAM to provide meaningful representations of model decision-making
processes, which improved understanding and trust in automated disease
diagnostics. These findings demonstrate ResNet50's potential to revolutionize
pumpkin leaf disease detection, allowing for earlier and more accurate
treatments.


## AI 摘要

南瓜叶病害严重影响农业生产，传统人工检测方法效率低且易出错。本研究使用包含2000张高清图像的"南瓜叶病害数据集"，涵盖霜霉病、白粉病、花叶病、细菌性叶斑病和健康叶片五类。通过测试多种深度学习模型，发现ResNet50表现最优，准确率达90.5%。研究还采用可解释AI技术(Grad-CAM等)增强模型决策透明度。结果表明，ResNet50能有效实现南瓜叶病害的自动化精准检测，有助于早期防治。该研究为农业病害智能诊断提供了可靠解决方案。
