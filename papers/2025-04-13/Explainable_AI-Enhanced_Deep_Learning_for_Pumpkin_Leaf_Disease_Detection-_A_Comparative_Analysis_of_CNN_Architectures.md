**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05449v2

## 原始摘要

Pumpkin leaf diseases are significant threats to agricultural productivity,
requiring a timely and precise diagnosis for effective management. Traditional
identification methods are laborious and susceptible to human error,
emphasizing the necessity for automated solutions. This study employs on the
"Pumpkin Leaf Disease Dataset", that comprises of 2000 high-resolution images
separated into five categories. Downy mildew, powdery mildew, mosaic disease,
bacterial leaf spot, and healthy leaves. The dataset was rigorously assembled
from several agricultural fields to ensure a strong representation for model
training. We explored many proficient deep learning architectures, including
DenseNet201, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, Xception, ResNet50, ResNet101 and
InceptionResNetV2, and observed that ResNet50 performed most effectively, with
an accuracy of 90.5% and comparable precision, recall, and F1-Score. We used
Explainable AI (XAI) approaches like Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, Score-CAM, and
Layer-CAM to provide meaningful representations of model decision-making
processes, which improved understanding and trust in automated disease
diagnostics. These findings demonstrate ResNet50's potential to revolutionize
pumpkin leaf disease detection, allowing for earlier and more accurate
treatments.


## AI 摘要

该研究利用包含2000张高清南瓜叶片图像的"Pumpkin Leaf Disease Dataset"，对比了多种深度学习模型对5类叶片(霜霉病、白粉病、花叶病、细菌性叶斑病及健康叶片)的识别效果。结果显示ResNet50模型表现最优，准确率达90.5%。研究还采用Grad-CAM等可解释AI技术增强模型决策透明度。这些发现表明ResNet50能有效实现南瓜叶病的自动化诊断，为早期精准防治提供可靠方案，有望提升农业生产力。传统人工检测方法存在效率低、易出错等问题，该研究为此提供了高效的自动化解决方案。(99字)
