# The Urban Impact of AI: Modeling Feedback Loops in Next-Venue Recommendation

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07911v1

## 原始摘要

Next-venue recommender systems are increasingly embedded in location-based
services, shaping individual mobility decisions in urban environments. While
their predictive accuracy has been extensively studied, less attention has been
paid to their systemic impact on urban dynamics. In this work, we introduce a
simulation framework to model the human-AI feedback loop underpinning
next-venue recommendation, capturing how algorithmic suggestions influence
individual behavior, which in turn reshapes the data used to retrain the
models. Our simulations, grounded in real-world mobility data, systematically
explore the effects of algorithmic adoption across a range of recommendation
strategies. We find that while recommender systems consistently increase
individual-level diversity in visited venues, they may simultaneously amplify
collective inequality by concentrating visits on a limited subset of popular
places. This divergence extends to the structure of social co-location
networks, revealing broader implications for urban accessibility and spatial
segregation. Our framework operationalizes the feedback loop in next-venue
recommendation and offers a novel lens through which to assess the societal
impact of AI-assisted mobility-providing a computational tool to anticipate
future risks, evaluate regulatory interventions, and inform the design of ethic
algorithmic systems.


## AI 摘要

基于位置的推荐系统正日益影响城市流动性决策。本研究通过模拟框架分析了人机反馈循环对下一地点推荐的影响，发现算法虽能提升个人访问场所的多样性，却可能加剧集体不平等——使访问集中在少数热门地点。基于真实移动数据的模拟显示，不同推荐策略会重塑社会共处网络结构，对城市可达性和空间隔离产生深远影响。该框架为评估AI辅助移动的社会影响提供了新工具，可帮助预测风险、评估监管措施并指导伦理算法设计。研究揭示了推荐系统在提升个体体验与加剧社会不平等间的矛盾。
