# The Urban Impact of AI: Modeling Feedback Loops in Next-Venue Recommendation

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07911v1

## 原始摘要

Next-venue recommender systems are increasingly embedded in location-based
services, shaping individual mobility decisions in urban environments. While
their predictive accuracy has been extensively studied, less attention has been
paid to their systemic impact on urban dynamics. In this work, we introduce a
simulation framework to model the human-AI feedback loop underpinning
next-venue recommendation, capturing how algorithmic suggestions influence
individual behavior, which in turn reshapes the data used to retrain the
models. Our simulations, grounded in real-world mobility data, systematically
explore the effects of algorithmic adoption across a range of recommendation
strategies. We find that while recommender systems consistently increase
individual-level diversity in visited venues, they may simultaneously amplify
collective inequality by concentrating visits on a limited subset of popular
places. This divergence extends to the structure of social co-location
networks, revealing broader implications for urban accessibility and spatial
segregation. Our framework operationalizes the feedback loop in next-venue
recommendation and offers a novel lens through which to assess the societal
impact of AI-assisted mobility-providing a computational tool to anticipate
future risks, evaluate regulatory interventions, and inform the design of ethic
algorithmic systems.


## AI 摘要

基于位置的推荐系统正日益影响城市流动性决策，但其系统性影响尚未充分研究。本研究通过模拟人机反馈循环，分析算法推荐如何改变用户行为并反哺模型训练。基于真实数据的研究发现：推荐系统虽能提升个人访问场所的多样性，却可能加剧集体不平等——使访问集中于少数热门地点。这种分化还体现在社交共处网络结构中，对城市可达性和空间隔离产生深远影响。该框架为预测AI辅助出行的社会影响提供了计算工具，可帮助评估监管措施并指导伦理算法设计。
