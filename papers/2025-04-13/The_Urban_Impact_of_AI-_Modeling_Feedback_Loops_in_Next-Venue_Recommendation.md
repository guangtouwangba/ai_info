# The Urban Impact of AI: Modeling Feedback Loops in Next-Venue Recommendation

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07911v1

## 原始摘要

Next-venue recommender systems are increasingly embedded in location-based
services, shaping individual mobility decisions in urban environments. While
their predictive accuracy has been extensively studied, less attention has been
paid to their systemic impact on urban dynamics. In this work, we introduce a
simulation framework to model the human-AI feedback loop underpinning
next-venue recommendation, capturing how algorithmic suggestions influence
individual behavior, which in turn reshapes the data used to retrain the
models. Our simulations, grounded in real-world mobility data, systematically
explore the effects of algorithmic adoption across a range of recommendation
strategies. We find that while recommender systems consistently increase
individual-level diversity in visited venues, they may simultaneously amplify
collective inequality by concentrating visits on a limited subset of popular
places. This divergence extends to the structure of social co-location
networks, revealing broader implications for urban accessibility and spatial
segregation. Our framework operationalizes the feedback loop in next-venue
recommendation and offers a novel lens through which to assess the societal
impact of AI-assisted mobility-providing a computational tool to anticipate
future risks, evaluate regulatory interventions, and inform the design of ethic
algorithmic systems.


## AI 摘要

基于位置的推荐系统正日益影响城市出行决策，但其系统性影响尚未充分研究。本文提出一个模拟框架，分析AI推荐与人类行为的反馈循环。研究发现：虽然推荐系统能增加个人访问场所的多样性，但会加剧集体不平等——使访问集中在少数热门地点。这种影响还体现在社交共处网络结构中，对城市可达性和空间隔离产生深远影响。该框架为评估AI辅助出行的社会影响提供了新视角，可帮助预测风险、评估监管措施并指导伦理算法设计。研究基于真实出行数据，系统比较了不同推荐策略的效果。
