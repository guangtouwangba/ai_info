# Reinforcing Clinical Decision Support through Multi-Agent Systems and Ethical AI Governance

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03699v2

## 原始摘要

In the age of data-driven medicine, it is paramount to include explainable
and ethically managed artificial intelligence in explaining clinical decision
support systems to achieve trustworthy and effective patient care. The focus of
this paper is on a new architecture of a multi-agent system for clinical
decision support that uses modular agents to analyze laboratory results, vital
signs, and the clinical context and then integrates these results to drive
predictions and validate outcomes. We describe our implementation with the eICU
database to run lab-analysis-specific agents, vitals-only interpreters, and
contextual reasoners and then run the prediction module and a validation agent.
Everything is a transparent implementation of business logic, influenced by the
principles of ethical AI governance such as Autonomy, Fairness, and
Accountability. It provides visible results that this agent-based framework not
only improves on interpretability and accuracy but also on reinforcing trust in
AI-assisted decisions in an intensive care setting.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种新型多智能体临床决策支持系统架构，采用模块化智能体分析实验室结果、生命体征和临床情境，并整合结果进行预测和验证。基于eICU数据库的实现展示了该系统通过透明业务逻辑和伦理AI治理原则（自主性、公平性、问责制），在重症监护场景中显著提升了AI决策的可解释性、准确性和可信度。各功能模块（实验室分析、生命体征解读、情境推理）的协同运作验证了该框架在增强AI辅助决策可信度方面的有效性。
