# We Are All Creators: Generative AI, Collective Knowledge, and the Path Towards Human-AI Synergy

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07936v1

## 原始摘要

Generative AI presents a profound challenge to traditional notions of human
uniqueness, particularly in creativity. Fueled by neural network based
foundation models, these systems demonstrate remarkable content generation
capabilities, sparking intense debates about authorship, copyright, and
intelligence itself. This paper argues that generative AI represents an
alternative form of intelligence and creativity, operating through mathematical
pattern synthesis rather than biological understanding or verbatim replication.
The fundamental differences between artificial and biological neural networks
reveal AI learning as primarily statistical pattern extraction from vast
datasets crystallized forms of collective human knowledge scraped from the
internet. This perspective complicates copyright theft narratives and
highlights practical challenges in attributing AI outputs to individual
sources. Rather than pursuing potentially futile legal restrictions, we
advocate for human AI synergy. By embracing generative AI as a complementary
tool alongside human intuition, context, and ethical judgment, society can
unlock unprecedented innovation, democratize creative expression, and address
complex challenges. This collaborative approach, grounded in realistic
understanding of AIs capabilities and limitations, offers the most promising
path forward. Additionally, recognizing these models as products of collective
human knowledge raises ethical questions about accessibility ensuring equitable
access to these tools could prevent widening societal divides and leverage
their full potential for collective benefit.


## AI 摘要

生成式AI对传统的人类独特性观念，尤其是创造力方面，提出了深刻挑战。基于神经网络的基础模型展现出强大的内容生成能力，引发了关于著作权、版权及智能本质的激烈争论。该研究认为，生成式AI代表了一种通过数学模式合成而非生物理解或直接复制的替代性智能与创造力形式。AI学习本质上是统计性模式提取，源于互联网上的人类集体知识结晶。这使版权争议复杂化，并突显了追溯AI输出来源的困难。研究主张人机协同，将AI作为人类直觉、伦理判断的补充工具，以释放创新潜力，同时需确保公平获取这些集体知识产物，避免加剧社会不平等。
