# We Are All Creators: Generative AI, Collective Knowledge, and the Path Towards Human-AI Synergy

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07936v1

## 原始摘要

Generative AI presents a profound challenge to traditional notions of human
uniqueness, particularly in creativity. Fueled by neural network based
foundation models, these systems demonstrate remarkable content generation
capabilities, sparking intense debates about authorship, copyright, and
intelligence itself. This paper argues that generative AI represents an
alternative form of intelligence and creativity, operating through mathematical
pattern synthesis rather than biological understanding or verbatim replication.
The fundamental differences between artificial and biological neural networks
reveal AI learning as primarily statistical pattern extraction from vast
datasets crystallized forms of collective human knowledge scraped from the
internet. This perspective complicates copyright theft narratives and
highlights practical challenges in attributing AI outputs to individual
sources. Rather than pursuing potentially futile legal restrictions, we
advocate for human AI synergy. By embracing generative AI as a complementary
tool alongside human intuition, context, and ethical judgment, society can
unlock unprecedented innovation, democratize creative expression, and address
complex challenges. This collaborative approach, grounded in realistic
understanding of AIs capabilities and limitations, offers the most promising
path forward. Additionally, recognizing these models as products of collective
human knowledge raises ethical questions about accessibility ensuring equitable
access to these tools could prevent widening societal divides and leverage
their full potential for collective benefit.


## AI 摘要

生成式AI对传统人类独特性（尤其是创造力）概念提出了深刻挑战。基于神经网络的基础模型展现出强大的内容生成能力，引发了关于著作权和智能本质的争论。论文指出，生成式AI通过数学模式合成（而非生物理解）展现另类智能与创造力。其学习本质是从海量人类集体知识数据中提取统计模式，这使得版权归属变得复杂。作者主张人机协同：将AI作为人类直觉、伦理判断的补充工具，以释放创新潜力、 democratize 创意表达。同时强调，这些模型作为集体知识产物，其公平获取关乎社会公平，需确保工具可及性以避免加剧社会分化。
