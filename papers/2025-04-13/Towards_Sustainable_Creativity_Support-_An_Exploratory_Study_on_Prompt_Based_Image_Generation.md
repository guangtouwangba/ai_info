# Towards Sustainable Creativity Support: An Exploratory Study on Prompt Based Image Generation

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07879v1

## 原始摘要

Creativity is a valuable human skill that has long been augmented through
both analog and digital tools. Recent progress in generative AI, such as image
generation, provides a disruptive technological solution to supporting human
creativity further and helping humans generate solutions faster. While AI image
generators can help to rapidly visualize ideas based on user prompts, the use
of such AI systems has also been critiqued due to their considerable energy
usage. In this paper, we report on a user study (N = 24) to understand whether
energy consumption can be reduced without impeding on the tool's perceived
creativity support. Our results highlight that, for example, a main effect of
(image generation) condition on energy consumption, and index of creativity
support per prompt but not per task, which seem mainly attributed to image
quantity per prompt. We provide details of our analysis on the relation between
energy usage, creativity support, and prompting behavior, including attitudes
towards designing with AI and its environmental impact.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文研究了AI图像生成工具在支持人类创造力时的能耗问题。通过24人用户实验发现，图像生成条件显著影响能耗和每个提示的创造力支持指数，但不会影响整个任务的创造力支持，这主要与每个提示生成的图像数量有关。研究分析了能耗、创造力支持和用户提示行为之间的关系，同时探讨了用户对AI设计及其环境影响的态度。结果表明，可以在不损害创造力支持的情况下降低AI工具的能耗。研究为平衡AI创造力辅助与可持续性提供了见解。
