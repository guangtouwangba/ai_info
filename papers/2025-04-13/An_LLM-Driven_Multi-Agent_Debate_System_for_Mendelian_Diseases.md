# An LLM-Driven Multi-Agent Debate System for Mendelian Diseases

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07881v1

## 原始摘要

Accurate diagnosis of Mendelian diseases is crucial for precision therapy and
assistance in preimplantation genetic diagnosis. However, existing methods
often fall short of clinical standards or depend on extensive datasets to build
pretrained machine learning models. To address this, we introduce an innovative
LLM-Driven multi-agent debate system (MD2GPS) with natural language
explanations of the diagnostic results. It utilizes a language model to
transform results from data-driven and knowledge-driven agents into natural
language, then fostering a debate between these two specialized agents. This
system has been tested on 1,185 samples across four independent datasets,
enhancing the TOP1 accuracy from 42.9% to 66% on average. Additionally, in a
challenging cohort of 72 cases, MD2GPS identified potential pathogenic genes in
12 patients, reducing the diagnostic time by 90%. The methods within each
module of this multi-agent debate system are also replaceable, facilitating its
adaptation for diagnosing and researching other complex diseases.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种创新的LLM驱动多智能体辩论系统(MD2GPS)，用于提高孟德尔疾病的诊断准确性。该系统通过语言模型将数据驱动和知识驱动代理的结果转化为自然语言，并促进两者间的辩论。在4个独立数据集的1185个样本测试中，TOP1准确率从42.9%提升至66%。在72例疑难病例中，该系统发现了12例患者的潜在致病基因，诊断时间缩短90%。该系统各模块方法可替换，便于扩展应用于其他复杂疾病的诊断研究。该系统为精准治疗和植入前遗传学诊断提供了更高效可靠的解决方案。
