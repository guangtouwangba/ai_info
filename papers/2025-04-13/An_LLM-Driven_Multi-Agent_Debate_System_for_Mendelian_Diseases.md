# An LLM-Driven Multi-Agent Debate System for Mendelian Diseases

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07881v1

## 原始摘要

Accurate diagnosis of Mendelian diseases is crucial for precision therapy and
assistance in preimplantation genetic diagnosis. However, existing methods
often fall short of clinical standards or depend on extensive datasets to build
pretrained machine learning models. To address this, we introduce an innovative
LLM-Driven multi-agent debate system (MD2GPS) with natural language
explanations of the diagnostic results. It utilizes a language model to
transform results from data-driven and knowledge-driven agents into natural
language, then fostering a debate between these two specialized agents. This
system has been tested on 1,185 samples across four independent datasets,
enhancing the TOP1 accuracy from 42.9% to 66% on average. Additionally, in a
challenging cohort of 72 cases, MD2GPS identified potential pathogenic genes in
12 patients, reducing the diagnostic time by 90%. The methods within each
module of this multi-agent debate system are also replaceable, facilitating its
adaptation for diagnosing and researching other complex diseases.


## AI 摘要

研究人员开发了一种基于大语言模型的多智能体辩论系统MD2GPS，用于提高孟德尔疾病的诊断准确性。该系统通过数据驱动和知识驱动智能体的自然语言辩论，将诊断准确率从42.9%提升至66%，并在72例疑难病例中成功识别12例致病基因，缩短90%诊断时间。该系统具有模块可替换性，可拓展应用于其他复杂疾病的诊断研究。测试覆盖1,185个样本，证明了其临床实用价值。
