# Dual Engines of Thoughts: A Depth-Breadth Integration Framework for Open-Ended Analysis

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07872v1

## 原始摘要

We propose the Dual Engines of Thoughts (DEoT), an analytical framework for
comprehensive open-ended reasoning. While traditional reasoning frameworks
primarily focus on finding "the best answer" or "the correct answer" for
single-answer problems, DEoT is specifically designed for "open-ended
questions," enabling both broader and deeper analytical exploration. The
framework centers on three key components: a Base Prompter for refining user
queries, a Solver Agent that orchestrates task decomposition, execution, and
validation, and a Dual-Engine System consisting of a Breadth Engine (to explore
diverse impact factors) and a Depth Engine (to perform deep investigations).
This integrated design allows DEoT to balance wide-ranging coverage with
in-depth analysis, and it is highly customizable, enabling users to adjust
analytical parameters and tool configurations based on specific requirements.
Experimental results show that DEoT excels in addressing complex, multi-faceted
questions, achieving a total win rate of 77-86% compared to existing reasoning
models, thus highlighting its effectiveness in real-world applications.


## AI 摘要

本文提出"思维双引擎"(DEoT)框架，专为开放性问题设计，突破传统单答案推理的局限。该框架包含三大核心：基础提示器优化用户查询，求解代理协调任务分解与验证，以及由广度引擎(探索多元因素)和深度引擎(深入分析)构成的双引擎系统。DEoT能平衡广泛覆盖与深度分析，支持参数自定义，实验显示其处理复杂问题的胜率达77-86%，显著优于现有模型。这种集成设计在现实应用中展现出卓越的多维度分析能力，为开放性问题提供更全面的解决方案。
