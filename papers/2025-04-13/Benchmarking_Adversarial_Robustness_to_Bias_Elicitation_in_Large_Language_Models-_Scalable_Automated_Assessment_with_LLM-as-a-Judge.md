# Benchmarking Adversarial Robustness to Bias Elicitation in Large Language Models: Scalable Automated Assessment with LLM-as-a-Judge

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07887v1

## 原始摘要

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence,
driving advancements in machine translation, summarization, and conversational
agents. However, their increasing integration into critical societal domains
has raised concerns about embedded biases, which can perpetuate stereotypes and
compromise fairness. These biases stem from various sources, including
historical inequalities in training data, linguistic imbalances, and
adversarial manipulation. Despite mitigation efforts, recent studies indicate
that LLMs remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks designed to elicit biased
responses. This work proposes a scalable benchmarking framework to evaluate LLM
robustness against adversarial bias elicitation. Our methodology involves (i)
systematically probing models with a multi-task approach targeting biases
across various sociocultural dimensions, (ii) quantifying robustness through
safety scores using an LLM-as-a-Judge approach for automated assessment of
model responses, and (iii) employing jailbreak techniques to investigate
vulnerabilities in safety mechanisms. Our analysis examines prevalent biases in
both small and large state-of-the-art models and their impact on model safety.
Additionally, we assess the safety of domain-specific models fine-tuned for
critical fields, such as medicine. Finally, we release a curated dataset of
bias-related prompts, CLEAR-Bias, to facilitate systematic vulnerability
benchmarking. Our findings reveal critical trade-offs between model size and
safety, aiding the development of fairer and more robust future language
models.


## AI 摘要

大型语言模型(LLMs)在推动AI进步的同时，其潜在偏见问题日益引发关注。这些偏见源于训练数据中的历史不平等、语言不平衡和对抗性操纵。研究提出了一种可扩展的评估框架，通过多任务方法系统探测模型在不同社会文化维度上的偏见，采用LLM-as-a-Judge方法量化模型安全性，并利用越狱技术检测安全机制漏洞。分析揭示了模型大小与安全性之间的关键权衡，评估了医疗等关键领域专用模型的安全性。研究发布了CLEAR-Bias偏见提示数据集，为开发更公平、更稳健的语言模型提供支持。
