# Information Fusion in Smart Agriculture: Machine Learning Applications and Future Research Directions

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17465v2

## 原始摘要

Machine learning (ML) is a rapidly evolving technology with expanding
applications across various fields. This paper presents a comprehensive survey
of recent ML applications in agriculture for sustainability and efficiency.
Existing reviews mainly focus on narrow subdomains or lack a fusion-driven
perspectives. This study provides a combined analysis of ML applications in
agriculture, structured around five key objectives: (i) Analyzing ML techniques
across pre-harvesting, harvesting, and post-harvesting phases. (ii)
Demonstrating how ML can be used with agricultural data and data fusion. (iii)
Conducting a bibliometric and statistical analysis to reveal research trends
and activity. (iv) Investigating real-world case studies of leading artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven agricultural companies that use different types of
multisensors and multisource data. (v) Compiling publicly available datasets to
support ML model training. Going beyond existing previous reviews, this review
focuses on how machine learning (ML) techniques, combined with multi-source
data fusion (integrating remote sensing, IoT, and climate analytics), enhance
precision agriculture by improving predictive accuracy and decision-making.
Case studies and statistical insights illustrate the evolving landscape of AI
driven smart farming, while future research directions also discusses
challenges associated with data fusion for heterogeneous datasets. This review
bridges the gap between AI research and agricultural applications, offering a
roadmap for researchers, industry professionals, and policymakers to harness
information fusion and ML for advancing precision agriculture.
