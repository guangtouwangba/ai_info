# VisEscape: A Benchmark for Evaluating Exploration-driven Decision-making in Virtual Escape Rooms

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14427v1

## 原始摘要

Escape rooms present a unique cognitive challenge that demands
exploration-driven planning: players should actively search their environment,
continuously update their knowledge based on new discoveries, and connect
disparate clues to determine which elements are relevant to their objectives.
Motivated by this, we introduce VisEscape, a benchmark of 20 virtual escape
rooms specifically designed to evaluate AI models under these challenging
conditions, where success depends not only on solving isolated puzzles but also
on iteratively constructing and refining spatial-temporal knowledge of a
dynamically changing environment. On VisEscape, we observed that even
state-of-the-art multimodal models generally fail to escape the rooms, showing
considerable variation in their levels of progress and trajectories. To address
this issue, we propose VisEscaper, which effectively integrates Memory,
Feedback, and ReAct modules, demonstrating significant improvements by
performing 3.7 times more effectively and 5.0 times more efficiently on
average.


## AI 摘要

VisEscape是一个包含20个虚拟密室逃脱的基准测试，旨在评估AI模型在探索驱动规划中的表现。该测试要求模型不仅解决孤立谜题，还需动态构建和优化时空知识。研究发现，即使最先进的多模态模型也难以成功逃脱，表现差异显著。为此，提出了VisEscaper模型，通过整合记忆、反馈和ReAct模块，显著提升了性能，平均效率提高了5倍，效果提升了3.7倍。
