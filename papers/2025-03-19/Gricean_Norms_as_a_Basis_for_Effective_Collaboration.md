# Gricean Norms as a Basis for Effective Collaboration

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14484v1

## 原始摘要

Effective human-AI collaboration hinges not only on the AI agent's ability to
follow explicit instructions but also on its capacity to navigate ambiguity,
incompleteness, invalidity, and irrelevance in communication. Gricean
conversational and inference norms facilitate collaboration by aligning unclear
instructions with cooperative principles. We propose a normative framework that
integrates Gricean norms and cognitive frameworks -- common ground, relevance
theory, and theory of mind -- into large language model (LLM) based agents. The
normative framework adopts the Gricean maxims of quantity, quality, relation,
and manner, along with inference, as Gricean norms to interpret unclear
instructions, which are: ambiguous, incomplete, invalid, or irrelevant. Within
this framework, we introduce Lamoids, GPT-4 powered agents designed to
collaborate with humans. To assess the influence of Gricean norms in human-AI
collaboration, we evaluate two versions of a Lamoid: one with norms and one
without. In our experiments, a Lamoid collaborates with a human to achieve
shared goals in a grid world (Doors, Keys, and Gems) by interpreting both clear
and unclear natural language instructions. Our results reveal that the Lamoid
with Gricean norms achieves higher task accuracy and generates clearer, more
accurate, and contextually relevant responses than the Lamoid without norms.
This improvement stems from the normative framework, which enhances the agent's
pragmatic reasoning, fostering effective human-AI collaboration and enabling
context-aware communication in LLM-based agents.


## AI 摘要

有效的人机协作不仅依赖于AI遵循明确指令的能力，还取决于其处理沟通中的模糊性、不完整性、无效性和无关性的能力。研究提出了一种结合Gricean准则（数量、质量、关联、方式）和认知框架（共同基础、关联理论、心智理论）的规范框架，用于指导基于大语言模型（LLM）的AI代理。实验表明，采用Gricean准则的Lamoid（GPT-4驱动的代理）在任务准确性和生成清晰、准确、上下文相关的响应方面优于未采用准则的版本，表明规范框架增强了AI的实用推理能力，促进了有效的人机协作。
