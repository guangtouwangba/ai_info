# Gricean Norms as a Basis for Effective Collaboration

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14484v1

## 原始摘要

Effective human-AI collaboration hinges not only on the AI agent's ability to
follow explicit instructions but also on its capacity to navigate ambiguity,
incompleteness, invalidity, and irrelevance in communication. Gricean
conversational and inference norms facilitate collaboration by aligning unclear
instructions with cooperative principles. We propose a normative framework that
integrates Gricean norms and cognitive frameworks -- common ground, relevance
theory, and theory of mind -- into large language model (LLM) based agents. The
normative framework adopts the Gricean maxims of quantity, quality, relation,
and manner, along with inference, as Gricean norms to interpret unclear
instructions, which are: ambiguous, incomplete, invalid, or irrelevant. Within
this framework, we introduce Lamoids, GPT-4 powered agents designed to
collaborate with humans. To assess the influence of Gricean norms in human-AI
collaboration, we evaluate two versions of a Lamoid: one with norms and one
without. In our experiments, a Lamoid collaborates with a human to achieve
shared goals in a grid world (Doors, Keys, and Gems) by interpreting both clear
and unclear natural language instructions. Our results reveal that the Lamoid
with Gricean norms achieves higher task accuracy and generates clearer, more
accurate, and contextually relevant responses than the Lamoid without norms.
This improvement stems from the normative framework, which enhances the agent's
pragmatic reasoning, fostering effective human-AI collaboration and enabling
context-aware communication in LLM-based agents.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种整合Gricean准则和认知框架的规范性框架，旨在提升基于大型语言模型（LLM）的AI代理在人类-AI协作中的表现。该框架通过Gricean准则（数量、质量、关联、方式）和推理来解释模糊、不完整、无效或不相关的指令。实验中使用GPT-4驱动的Lamoid代理在网格世界任务中与人类协作，结果显示，遵循Gricean准则的Lamoid在任务准确性和生成清晰、准确、上下文相关的响应方面表现更优。这表明规范性框架增强了AI的语用推理能力，促进了有效的人类-AI协作。
