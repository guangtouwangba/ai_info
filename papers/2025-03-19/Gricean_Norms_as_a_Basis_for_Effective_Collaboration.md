# Gricean Norms as a Basis for Effective Collaboration

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14484v1

## 原始摘要

Effective human-AI collaboration hinges not only on the AI agent's ability to
follow explicit instructions but also on its capacity to navigate ambiguity,
incompleteness, invalidity, and irrelevance in communication. Gricean
conversational and inference norms facilitate collaboration by aligning unclear
instructions with cooperative principles. We propose a normative framework that
integrates Gricean norms and cognitive frameworks -- common ground, relevance
theory, and theory of mind -- into large language model (LLM) based agents. The
normative framework adopts the Gricean maxims of quantity, quality, relation,
and manner, along with inference, as Gricean norms to interpret unclear
instructions, which are: ambiguous, incomplete, invalid, or irrelevant. Within
this framework, we introduce Lamoids, GPT-4 powered agents designed to
collaborate with humans. To assess the influence of Gricean norms in human-AI
collaboration, we evaluate two versions of a Lamoid: one with norms and one
without. In our experiments, a Lamoid collaborates with a human to achieve
shared goals in a grid world (Doors, Keys, and Gems) by interpreting both clear
and unclear natural language instructions. Our results reveal that the Lamoid
with Gricean norms achieves higher task accuracy and generates clearer, more
accurate, and contextually relevant responses than the Lamoid without norms.
This improvement stems from the normative framework, which enhances the agent's
pragmatic reasoning, fostering effective human-AI collaboration and enabling
context-aware communication in LLM-based agents.


## AI 摘要

有效的人机协作不仅依赖于AI遵循明确指令的能力，还需其应对沟通中的模糊性、不完整性、无效性和无关性。本文提出了一种结合Gricean准则（数量、质量、关联、方式）和认知框架（共同基础、关联理论、心理理论）的规范性框架，用于指导基于大语言模型（LLM）的智能体。通过实验，我们评估了两种版本的Lamoid（一种由GPT-4驱动的智能体）：一种遵循Gricean准则，另一种不遵循。结果表明，遵循Gricean准则的Lamoid在任务准确性和生成清晰、准确、上下文相关的响应方面表现更优，显著提升了人机协作效果。
