# GenoTEX: An LLM Agent Benchmark for Automated Gene Expression Data Analysis

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15341v3

## 原始摘要

Recent advancements in machine learning have significantly improved the
identification of disease-associated genes from gene expression datasets.
However, these processes often require extensive expertise and manual effort,
limiting their scalability. Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown
promise in automating these tasks due to their increasing problem-solving
abilities. To support the evaluation and development of such methods, we
introduce GenoTEX, a benchmark dataset for the automated analysis of gene
expression data. GenoTEX provides analysis code and results for solving a wide
range of gene-trait association problems, encompassing dataset selection,
preprocessing, and statistical analysis, in a pipeline that follows
computational genomics standards. The benchmark includes expert-curated
annotations from bioinformaticians to ensure accuracy and reliability. To
provide baselines for these tasks, we present GenoAgent, a team of LLM-based
agents that adopt a multi-step programming workflow with flexible
self-correction, to collaboratively analyze gene expression datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate the potential of LLM-based methods in analyzing genomic
data, while error analysis highlights the challenges and areas for future
improvement. We propose GenoTEX as a promising resource for benchmarking and
enhancing automated methods for gene expression data analysis. The benchmark is
available at https://github.com/Liu-Hy/GenoTEX.


## AI 摘要

近期机器学习在基因表达数据疾病相关基因识别方面取得显著进展，但传统方法依赖专家经验且难以扩展。为此，研究者开发了GenoTEX基准数据集，包含标准化的基因-性状关联分析流程（数据选择、预处理和统计分析）及专家验证结果。同时提出基于大语言模型的GenoAgent系统，采用多智能体协作编程与自我修正机制来自动化分析流程。实验证明该方法潜力，但也揭示了现存挑战。GenoTEX为基因表达分析的自动化方法提供了评估基准，相关资源已在GitHub开源。该研究为基因组学分析的智能化转型提供了新思路。
