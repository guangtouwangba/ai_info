# GenoTEX: An LLM Agent Benchmark for Automated Gene Expression Data Analysis

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15341v3

## 原始摘要

Recent advancements in machine learning have significantly improved the
identification of disease-associated genes from gene expression datasets.
However, these processes often require extensive expertise and manual effort,
limiting their scalability. Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown
promise in automating these tasks due to their increasing problem-solving
abilities. To support the evaluation and development of such methods, we
introduce GenoTEX, a benchmark dataset for the automated analysis of gene
expression data. GenoTEX provides analysis code and results for solving a wide
range of gene-trait association problems, encompassing dataset selection,
preprocessing, and statistical analysis, in a pipeline that follows
computational genomics standards. The benchmark includes expert-curated
annotations from bioinformaticians to ensure accuracy and reliability. To
provide baselines for these tasks, we present GenoAgent, a team of LLM-based
agents that adopt a multi-step programming workflow with flexible
self-correction, to collaboratively analyze gene expression datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate the potential of LLM-based methods in analyzing genomic
data, while error analysis highlights the challenges and areas for future
improvement. We propose GenoTEX as a promising resource for benchmarking and
enhancing automated methods for gene expression data analysis. The benchmark is
available at https://github.com/Liu-Hy/GenoTEX.


## AI 摘要

近期机器学习的发展显著提升了从基因表达数据中识别疾病相关基因的能力，但该过程通常依赖专业知识和人工操作，限制了可扩展性。为解决这一问题，研究团队开发了GenoTEX基准数据集，用于自动化基因表达数据分析的评估。该数据集包含标准化的分析流程、专家标注及多步骤编程工作流框架GenoAgent（基于大语言模型的智能体系统）。实验表明，大语言模型在基因组数据分析中具有潜力，但也存在需改进的挑战。GenoTEX为自动化基因分析方法的基准测试和优化提供了资源平台，相关数据已开源。
