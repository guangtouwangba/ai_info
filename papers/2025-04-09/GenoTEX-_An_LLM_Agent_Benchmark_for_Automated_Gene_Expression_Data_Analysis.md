# GenoTEX: An LLM Agent Benchmark for Automated Gene Expression Data Analysis

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15341v3

## 原始摘要

Recent advancements in machine learning have significantly improved the
identification of disease-associated genes from gene expression datasets.
However, these processes often require extensive expertise and manual effort,
limiting their scalability. Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown
promise in automating these tasks due to their increasing problem-solving
abilities. To support the evaluation and development of such methods, we
introduce GenoTEX, a benchmark dataset for the automated analysis of gene
expression data. GenoTEX provides analysis code and results for solving a wide
range of gene-trait association problems, encompassing dataset selection,
preprocessing, and statistical analysis, in a pipeline that follows
computational genomics standards. The benchmark includes expert-curated
annotations from bioinformaticians to ensure accuracy and reliability. To
provide baselines for these tasks, we present GenoAgent, a team of LLM-based
agents that adopt a multi-step programming workflow with flexible
self-correction, to collaboratively analyze gene expression datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate the potential of LLM-based methods in analyzing genomic
data, while error analysis highlights the challenges and areas for future
improvement. We propose GenoTEX as a promising resource for benchmarking and
enhancing automated methods for gene expression data analysis. The benchmark is
available at https://github.com/Liu-Hy/GenoTEX.


## AI 摘要

GenoTEX是一个用于自动化基因表达数据分析的基准数据集，包含基因-性状关联分析的全流程（数据选择、预处理和统计分析），并遵循计算基因组学标准。该数据集提供专家标注以确保准确性，并支持评估基于大语言模型（LLM）的方法。研究团队还开发了GenoAgent，一个采用多步骤编程和自校正机制的LLM智能体系统，用于协作分析基因数据。实验表明LLM方法在基因组数据分析中具有潜力，但也存在挑战。GenoTEX可作为提升基因表达数据自动化分析方法的资源，相关基准已开源。
