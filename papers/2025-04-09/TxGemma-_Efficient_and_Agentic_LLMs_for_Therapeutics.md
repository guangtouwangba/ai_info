# TxGemma: Efficient and Agentic LLMs for Therapeutics

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06196v1

## 原始摘要

Therapeutic development is a costly and high-risk endeavor that is often
plagued by high failure rates. To address this, we introduce TxGemma, a suite
of efficient, generalist large language models (LLMs) capable of therapeutic
property prediction as well as interactive reasoning and explainability. Unlike
task-specific models, TxGemma synthesizes information from diverse sources,
enabling broad application across the therapeutic development pipeline. The
suite includes 2B, 9B, and 27B parameter models, fine-tuned from Gemma-2 on a
comprehensive dataset of small molecules, proteins, nucleic acids, diseases,
and cell lines. Across 66 therapeutic development tasks, TxGemma achieved
superior or comparable performance to the state-of-the-art generalist model on
64 (superior on 45), and against state-of-the-art specialist models on 50
(superior on 26). Fine-tuning TxGemma models on therapeutic downstream tasks,
such as clinical trial adverse event prediction, requires less training data
than fine-tuning base LLMs, making TxGemma suitable for data-limited
applications. Beyond these predictive capabilities, TxGemma features
conversational models that bridge the gap between general LLMs and specialized
property predictors. These allow scientists to interact in natural language,
provide mechanistic reasoning for predictions based on molecular structure, and
engage in scientific discussions. Building on this, we further introduce
Agentic-Tx, a generalist therapeutic agentic system powered by Gemini 2.5 that
reasons, acts, manages diverse workflows, and acquires external domain
knowledge. Agentic-Tx surpasses prior leading models on the Humanity's Last
Exam benchmark (Chemistry &amp; Biology) with 52.3% relative improvement over
o3-mini (high) and 26.7% over o3-mini (high) on GPQA (Chemistry) and excels
with improvements of 6.3% (ChemBench-Preference) and 2.4% (ChemBench-Mini) over
o3-mini (high).


## AI 摘要
