# Modeling Challenging Patient Interactions: LLMs for Medical Communication Training

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22250v2

## 原始摘要

Effective patient communication is pivotal in healthcare, yet traditional
medical training often lacks exposure to diverse, challenging interpersonal
dynamics. To bridge this gap, this study proposes the use of Large Language
Models (LLMs) to simulate authentic patient communication styles, specifically
the "accuser" and "rationalizer" personas derived from the Satir model, while
also ensuring multilingual applicability to accommodate diverse cultural
contexts and enhance accessibility for medical professionals. Leveraging
advanced prompt engineering, including behavioral prompts, author's notes, and
stubbornness mechanisms, we developed virtual patients (VPs) that embody
nuanced emotional and conversational traits. Medical professionals evaluated
these VPs, rating their authenticity (accuser: $3.8 \pm 1.0$; rationalizer:
$3.7 \pm 0.8$ on a 5-point Likert scale (from one to five)) and correctly
identifying their styles. Emotion analysis revealed distinct profiles: the
accuser exhibited pain, anger, and distress, while the rationalizer displayed
contemplation and calmness, aligning with predefined, detailed patient
description including medical history. Sentiment scores (on a scale from zero
to nine) further validated these differences in the communication styles, with
the accuser adopting negative ($3.1 \pm 0.6$) and the rationalizer more neutral
($4.0 \pm 0.4$) tone. These results underscore LLMs' capability to replicate
complex communication styles, offering transformative potential for medical
education. This approach equips trainees to navigate challenging clinical
scenarios by providing realistic, adaptable patient interactions, enhancing
empathy and diagnostic acumen. Our findings advocate for AI-driven tools as
scalable, cost-effective solutions to cultivate nuanced communication skills,
setting a foundation for future innovations in healthcare training.


## AI 摘要

本研究利用大语言模型（LLM）模拟基于Satir模型的"指责型"和"合理化型"患者角色，通过行为提示、作者注释和固执机制等高级提示工程，开发出具有细腻情感特征的虚拟患者（VPs）。医疗专业人员评估显示，两种角色的真实性评分（5分制）分别为3.8±1.0和3.7±0.8，并能准确识别其风格。情感分析表明，指责型患者表现出痛苦、愤怒（情感得分3.1±0.6），而合理化型患者则呈现沉思、平静（4.0±0.4）。研究证实LLM能有效复现复杂医患沟通模式，为培养医务人员共情能力和诊断技巧提供了可扩展、经济高效的AI培训方案。
