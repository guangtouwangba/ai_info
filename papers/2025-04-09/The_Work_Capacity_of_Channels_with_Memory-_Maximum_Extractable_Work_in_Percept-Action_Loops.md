# The Work Capacity of Channels with Memory: Maximum Extractable Work in Percept-Action Loops

## 原始摘要

Predicting future observations plays a central role in machine learning,
biology, economics, and many other fields. It lies at the heart of
organizational principles such as the variational free energy principle and has
even been shown -- based on the second law of thermodynamics -- to be necessary
for reaching the fundamental energetic limits of sequential information
processing. While the usefulness of the predictive paradigm is undisputed,
complex adaptive systems that interact with their environment are more than
just predictive machines: they have the power to act upon their environment and
cause change. In this work, we develop a framework to analyze the
thermodynamics of information processing in percept-action loops -- a model of
agent-environment interaction -- allowing us to investigate the thermodynamic
implications of actions and percepts on equal footing. To this end, we
introduce the concept of work capacity -- the maximum rate at which an agent
can expect to extract work from its environment. Our results reveal that
neither of two previously established design principles for work-efficient
agents -- maximizing predictive power and forgetting past actions -- remains
optimal in environments where actions have observable consequences. Instead, a
trade-off emerges: work-efficient agents must balance prediction and
forgetting, as remembering past actions can reduce the available free energy.
This highlights a fundamental departure from the thermodynamics of passive
observation, suggesting that prediction and energy efficiency may be at odds in
active learning systems.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文探讨了主动学习系统中预测与能量效率的关系。研究发现，在与环境互动的感知-行动循环中，仅最大化预测能力或遗忘过去行动的传统设计原则并不最优。当行动会产生可观察后果时，高效能代理必须在预测和遗忘间取得平衡——记住过去行动反而可能减少可用自由能。这揭示了主动学习系统与被动观察热力学的根本区别，表明预测能力与能量效率可能存在冲突。研究通过引入"工作容量"概念（代理从环境中提取功的最大速率），为分析代理-环境互动的热力学效应提供了新框架。
