# The Work Capacity of Channels with Memory: Maximum Extractable Work in Percept-Action Loops

## 原始摘要

Predicting future observations plays a central role in machine learning,
biology, economics, and many other fields. It lies at the heart of
organizational principles such as the variational free energy principle and has
even been shown -- based on the second law of thermodynamics -- to be necessary
for reaching the fundamental energetic limits of sequential information
processing. While the usefulness of the predictive paradigm is undisputed,
complex adaptive systems that interact with their environment are more than
just predictive machines: they have the power to act upon their environment and
cause change. In this work, we develop a framework to analyze the
thermodynamics of information processing in percept-action loops -- a model of
agent-environment interaction -- allowing us to investigate the thermodynamic
implications of actions and percepts on equal footing. To this end, we
introduce the concept of work capacity -- the maximum rate at which an agent
can expect to extract work from its environment. Our results reveal that
neither of two previously established design principles for work-efficient
agents -- maximizing predictive power and forgetting past actions -- remains
optimal in environments where actions have observable consequences. Instead, a
trade-off emerges: work-efficient agents must balance prediction and
forgetting, as remembering past actions can reduce the available free energy.
This highlights a fundamental departure from the thermodynamics of passive
observation, suggesting that prediction and energy efficiency may be at odds in
active learning systems.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文研究了主动学习系统中信息处理的热力学原理。作者提出了"工作容量"概念，量化智能体从环境中提取功的最大速率。研究发现，在具有可观察行为后果的环境中，既非最大化预测能力也非遗忘过往行为这两种传统设计原则能保持最优。相反，高效能智能体必须在预测与遗忘间取得平衡，因为记住过往行为可能降低可用自由能。这揭示了主动学习系统与被动观测系统的根本区别，表明预测能力与能量效率在主动系统中可能存在矛盾。该框架为分析感知-行为循环的热力学特性提供了新视角。
