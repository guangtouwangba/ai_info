# The Work Capacity of Channels with Memory: Maximum Extractable Work in Percept-Action Loops

## 原始摘要

Predicting future observations plays a central role in machine learning,
biology, economics, and many other fields. It lies at the heart of
organizational principles such as the variational free energy principle and has
even been shown -- based on the second law of thermodynamics -- to be necessary
for reaching the fundamental energetic limits of sequential information
processing. While the usefulness of the predictive paradigm is undisputed,
complex adaptive systems that interact with their environment are more than
just predictive machines: they have the power to act upon their environment and
cause change. In this work, we develop a framework to analyze the
thermodynamics of information processing in percept-action loops -- a model of
agent-environment interaction -- allowing us to investigate the thermodynamic
implications of actions and percepts on equal footing. To this end, we
introduce the concept of work capacity -- the maximum rate at which an agent
can expect to extract work from its environment. Our results reveal that
neither of two previously established design principles for work-efficient
agents -- maximizing predictive power and forgetting past actions -- remains
optimal in environments where actions have observable consequences. Instead, a
trade-off emerges: work-efficient agents must balance prediction and
forgetting, as remembering past actions can reduce the available free energy.
This highlights a fundamental departure from the thermodynamics of passive
observation, suggesting that prediction and energy efficiency may be at odds in
active learning systems.

这篇论文探讨了主动学习系统的热力学特性，提出了一个分析感知-动作循环中信息处理热力学的框架。研究发现，在与环境互动的主动系统中，传统基于预测效率的设计原则（最大化预测能力和遗忘过去行为）不再最优。作者引入"工作容量"概念来衡量系统从环境中提取功的最大速率，揭示了预测与能量效率之间存在新的权衡关系：高效系统必须在预测能力和行为记忆之间取得平衡，因为记住过去行为可能减少可用自由能。这表明主动系统的热力学特性与被动观测系统存在本质差异。
