# CREA: A Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework for Creative Content Generation with Diffusion Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05306v1

## 原始摘要

Creativity in AI imagery remains a fundamental challenge, requiring not only
the generation of visually compelling content but also the capacity to add
novel, expressive, and artistically rich transformations to images. Unlike
conventional editing tasks that rely on direct prompt-based modifications,
creative image editing demands an autonomous, iterative approach that balances
originality, coherence, and artistic intent. To address this, we introduce
CREA, a novel multi-agent collaborative framework that mimics the human
creative process. Our framework leverages a team of specialized AI agents who
dynamically collaborate to conceptualize, generate, critique, and enhance
images. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we
demonstrate that CREA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
diversity, semantic alignment, and creative transformation. By structuring
creativity as a dynamic, agentic process, CREA redefines the intersection of AI
and art, paving the way for autonomous AI-driven artistic exploration,
generative design, and human-AI co-creation. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work to introduce the task of creative editing.


## AI 摘要

本文提出CREA框架，通过多智能体协作模拟人类创作过程，解决AI图像创意编辑的挑战。不同于传统基于提示的直接修改，CREA采用自主迭代方法，由专门AI智能体协同完成构思、生成、评价和优化。实验表明，CREA在多样性、语义对齐和创意转换方面显著优于现有方法。该框架将创造力构建为动态代理过程，重新定义了AI与艺术的结合，为自主AI艺术探索、生成设计和人机共创开辟了新途径。据作者所知，这是首个针对创意编辑任务的研究。
