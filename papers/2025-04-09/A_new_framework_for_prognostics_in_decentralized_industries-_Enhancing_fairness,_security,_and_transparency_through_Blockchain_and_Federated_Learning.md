## 原始摘要

As global industries transition towards Industry 5.0 predictive maintenance
PM remains crucial for cost effective operations resilience and minimizing
downtime in increasingly smart manufacturing environments In this chapter we
explore how the integration of Federated Learning FL and blockchain BC
technologies enhances the prediction of machinerys Remaining Useful Life RUL
within decentralized and human centric industrial ecosystems Traditional
centralized data approaches raise concerns over privacy security and
scalability especially as Artificial intelligence AI driven smart manufacturing
becomes more prevalent This chapter leverages FL to enable localized model
training across multiple sites while utilizing BC to ensure trust transparency
and data integrity across the network This BC integrated FL framework optimizes
RUL predictions enhances data privacy and security establishes transparency and
promotes collaboration in decentralized manufacturing It addresses key
challenges such as maintaining privacy and security ensuring transparency and
fairness and incentivizing participation in decentralized networks Experimental
validation using the NASA CMAPSS dataset demonstrates the model effectiveness
in real world scenarios and we extend our findings to the broader research
community through open source code on GitHub inviting collaborative development
to drive innovation in Industry 5.0


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了在工业5.0背景下，如何通过联邦学习(FL)和区块链(BC)技术结合来提升设备剩余使用寿命(RUL)预测。传统集中式数据方法存在隐私、安全和扩展性问题，而FL支持多站点本地化模型训练，BC则确保网络中的信任、透明和数据完整性。该框架优化了RUL预测，增强数据隐私与安全，促进分散制造中的协作。研究使用NASA CMAPSS数据集验证了模型在实际场景中的有效性，并通过GitHub开源代码推动工业5.0的创新合作。
