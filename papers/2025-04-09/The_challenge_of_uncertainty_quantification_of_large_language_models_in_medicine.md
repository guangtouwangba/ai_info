# The challenge of uncertainty quantification of large language models in medicine

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05278v1

## 原始摘要

This study investigates uncertainty quantification in large language models
(LLMs) for medical applications, emphasizing both technical innovations and
philosophical implications. As LLMs become integral to clinical
decision-making, accurately communicating uncertainty is crucial for ensuring
reliable, safe, and ethical AI-assisted healthcare. Our research frames
uncertainty not as a barrier but as an essential part of knowledge that invites
a dynamic and reflective approach to AI design. By integrating advanced
probabilistic methods such as Bayesian inference, deep ensembles, and Monte
Carlo dropout with linguistic analysis that computes predictive and semantic
entropy, we propose a comprehensive framework that manages both epistemic and
aleatoric uncertainties. The framework incorporates surrogate modeling to
address limitations of proprietary APIs, multi-source data integration for
better context, and dynamic calibration via continual and meta-learning.
Explainability is embedded through uncertainty maps and confidence metrics to
support user trust and clinical interpretability. Our approach supports
transparent and ethical decision-making aligned with Responsible and Reflective
AI principles. Philosophically, we advocate accepting controlled ambiguity
instead of striving for absolute predictability, recognizing the inherent
provisionality of medical knowledge.


## AI 摘要

本研究探讨了大型语言模型(LLMs)在医疗应用中的不确定性量化问题，结合技术创新与哲学思考。研究强调不确定性是知识的重要组成部分，提出通过贝叶斯推理、深度集成和蒙特卡洛dropout等概率方法，结合预测熵和语义熵的语言分析，构建综合框架来管理认知和随机不确定性。该框架整合了代理模型、多源数据和动态校准技术，并通过不确定性图谱和置信度指标增强可解释性。研究主张接受可控模糊性而非追求绝对确定性，符合负责任AI原则，为临床决策提供透明、可靠的AI辅助，同时承认医学知识的固有暂定性。
