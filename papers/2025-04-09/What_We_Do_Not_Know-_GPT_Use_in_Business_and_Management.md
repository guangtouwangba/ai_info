# What We Do Not Know: GPT Use in Business and Management

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05273v1

## 原始摘要

This systematic review examines peer-reviewed studies on application of GPT
in business management, revealing significant knowledge gaps. Despite
identifying interesting research directions such as best practices,
benchmarking, performance comparisons, social impacts, our analysis yields only
42 relevant studies for the 22 months since its release. There are so few
studies looking at a particular sector or subfield that management researchers,
business consultants, policymakers, and journalists do not yet have enough
information to make well-founded statements on how GPT is being used in
businesses. The primary contribution of this paper is a call to action for
further research. We provide a description of current research and identify
knowledge gaps on the use of GPT in business. We cover the management subfields
of finance, marketing, human resources, strategy, operations, production, and
analytics, excluding retail and sales. We discuss gaps in knowledge of GPT
potential consequences on employment, productivity, environmental costs,
oppression, and small businesses. We propose how management consultants and the
media can help fill those gaps. We call for practical work on business control
systems as they relate to existing and foreseeable AI-related business
challenges. This work may be of interest to managers, to management
researchers, and to people working on AI in society.


## AI 摘要

这篇系统综述分析了GPT在商业管理中的应用研究，发现存在显著的知识缺口。尽管研究指出了最佳实践、基准测试、性能比较和社会影响等方向，但在GPT发布后的22个月内仅找到42篇相关研究。目前针对特定行业或子领域的研究过少，导致学者、顾问、政策制定者和记者难以全面评估GPT的商业应用现状。论文呼吁加强研究，梳理了金融、营销、人力资源等管理子领域的现有成果和知识缺口，并探讨了GPT对就业、生产力、环境成本等方面的影响。研究对管理者、学者和AI社会影响研究者具有参考价值。（99字）
