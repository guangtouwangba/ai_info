# Control Tax: The Price of Keeping AI in Check

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05296v1

## 原始摘要

The rapid integration of agentic AI into high-stakes real-world applications
requires robust oversight mechanisms. The emerging field of AI Control (AIC)
aims to provide such an oversight mechanism, but practical adoption depends
heavily on implementation overhead. To study this problem better, we introduce
the notion of Control tax -- the operational and financial cost of integrating
control measures into AI pipelines. Our work makes three key contributions to
the field of AIC: (1) we introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the
Control Tax and maps classifier performance to safety assurances; (2) we
conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in
adversarial settings, where attacker models insert subtle backdoors into code
while monitoring models attempt to detect these vulnerabilities; and (3) we
provide empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols and develop
optimized monitoring strategies that balance safety and cost-effectiveness
while accounting for practical constraints like auditing budgets. Our framework
enables practitioners to make informed decisions by systematically connecting
safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AIC through principled economic
feasibility assessment across different deployment contexts.


## AI 摘要

随着自主AI在高风险领域的快速应用，AI控制（AIC）领域应运而生，旨在提供监管机制。本研究提出"控制税"概念，即整合控制措施所需的运营和财务成本，并做出三项贡献：1）建立量化控制税的理论框架，将分类器性能与安全保障关联；2）在对抗环境中评估先进语言模型，研究攻击模型植入代码后门与监控模型检测漏洞的能力；3）估算控制协议的实际财务成本，开发兼顾安全性与成本效益的优化监控策略。该框架通过系统关联安全保障与成本，为不同部署场景的经济可行性评估提供决策依据。
