# Control Tax: The Price of Keeping AI in Check

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05296v1

## 原始摘要

The rapid integration of agentic AI into high-stakes real-world applications
requires robust oversight mechanisms. The emerging field of AI Control (AIC)
aims to provide such an oversight mechanism, but practical adoption depends
heavily on implementation overhead. To study this problem better, we introduce
the notion of Control tax -- the operational and financial cost of integrating
control measures into AI pipelines. Our work makes three key contributions to
the field of AIC: (1) we introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the
Control Tax and maps classifier performance to safety assurances; (2) we
conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in
adversarial settings, where attacker models insert subtle backdoors into code
while monitoring models attempt to detect these vulnerabilities; and (3) we
provide empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols and develop
optimized monitoring strategies that balance safety and cost-effectiveness
while accounting for practical constraints like auditing budgets. Our framework
enables practitioners to make informed decisions by systematically connecting
safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AIC through principled economic
feasibility assessment across different deployment contexts.


## AI 摘要

随着自主AI在高风险领域的快速应用，AI控制领域(AIC)亟需建立高效的监管机制。本研究提出"控制税"概念，即AI系统中实施控制措施所需的运营和财务成本。研究包含三大贡献：(1)建立量化控制税的理论框架，将分类器性能与安全保障关联；(2)在对抗环境下评估前沿语言模型，分析攻击模型植入后门代码与监测模型识别的对抗过程；(3)提供控制协议的实际成本估算，并开发兼顾安全性与成本效益的优化监测策略。该框架通过系统评估安全保证与成本的关系，为不同应用场景提供经济可行的AI控制方案。
