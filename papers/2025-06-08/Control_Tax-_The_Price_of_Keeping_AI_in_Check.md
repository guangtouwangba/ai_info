# Control Tax: The Price of Keeping AI in Check

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05296v1

## 原始摘要

The rapid integration of agentic AI into high-stakes real-world applications
requires robust oversight mechanisms. The emerging field of AI Control (AIC)
aims to provide such an oversight mechanism, but practical adoption depends
heavily on implementation overhead. To study this problem better, we introduce
the notion of Control tax -- the operational and financial cost of integrating
control measures into AI pipelines. Our work makes three key contributions to
the field of AIC: (1) we introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the
Control Tax and maps classifier performance to safety assurances; (2) we
conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in
adversarial settings, where attacker models insert subtle backdoors into code
while monitoring models attempt to detect these vulnerabilities; and (3) we
provide empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols and develop
optimized monitoring strategies that balance safety and cost-effectiveness
while accounting for practical constraints like auditing budgets. Our framework
enables practitioners to make informed decisions by systematically connecting
safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AIC through principled economic
feasibility assessment across different deployment contexts.


## AI 摘要

随着自主AI在高风险领域的快速应用，亟需建立有效的监管机制。AI控制领域(AIC)旨在提供此类监管，但实际应用受限于实施成本。本研究提出"控制税"概念，即AI系统中集成控制措施所需的运营和财务成本。研究贡献包括：(1)量化控制税的理论框架；(2)对抗环境下先进语言模型的全面评估；(3)控制协议的成本估算及优化监控策略开发。该框架通过系统关联安全保证与成本，帮助从业者在预算等实际约束下做出平衡安全与成本效益的决策，推动AI控制的经济可行性评估。
