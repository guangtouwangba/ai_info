# ProRefine: Inference-time Prompt Refinement with Textual Feedback

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05305v1

## 原始摘要

Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex
tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal
performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively
guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the
reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine,
an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual
feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine
dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional
training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical
reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only
boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of
larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI
deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.


## AI 摘要

ProRefine是一种创新的即时提示优化方法，通过利用大语言模型的文本反馈来改进多智能体协作工作流中的提示设计。该方法无需额外训练或真实标签，即可动态优化多步推理任务的提示。在五个数学推理基准测试中，ProRefine比零样本思维链基线高出3-37个百分点，显著提升了准确性。研究还表明，该方法能使较小模型达到与大模型相当的性能，有助于高效、可扩展的AI部署，并促进高性能AI的普及。这为解决智能体工作流中的错误传播和性能不佳问题提供了有效方案。
