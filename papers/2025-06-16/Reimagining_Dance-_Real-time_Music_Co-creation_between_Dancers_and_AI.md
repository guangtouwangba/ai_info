# Reimagining Dance: Real-time Music Co-creation between Dancers and AI

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12008v1

## 原始摘要

Dance performance traditionally follows a unidirectional relationship where
movement responds to music. While AI has advanced in various creative domains,
its application in dance has primarily focused on generating choreography from
musical input. We present a system that enables dancers to dynamically shape
musical environments through their movements. Our multi-modal architecture
creates a coherent musical composition by intelligently combining pre-recorded
musical clips in response to dance movements, establishing a bidirectional
creative partnership where dancers function as both performers and composers.
Through correlation analysis of performance data, we demonstrate emergent
communication patterns between movement qualities and audio features. This
approach reconceptualizes the role of AI in performing arts as a responsive
collaborator that expands possibilities for both professional dance performance
and improvisational artistic expression across broader populations.


## AI 摘要

传统舞蹈表演中，动作单向响应音乐。本研究提出了一种双向互动系统，通过多模态架构让舞者动态塑造音乐环境。该系统能智能组合预录音乐片段，实时响应舞者动作，建立舞者同时作为表演者和作曲家的创作伙伴关系。分析显示，动作特征与音频特征之间存在明显的关联模式。这种AI应用重新定义了表演艺术中技术的角色，使其成为响应式协作伙伴，既拓展了专业舞蹈表演的可能性，也为更广泛人群的即兴艺术表达开辟了新途径。
