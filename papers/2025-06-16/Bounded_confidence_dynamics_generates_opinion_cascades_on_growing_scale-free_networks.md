# Bounded confidence dynamics generates opinion cascades on growing scale-free networks

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02669v2

## 原始摘要

We study the pairwise bounded confidence model on scale-free networks where
new agents regularly arrive over time. The probability that arriving agents
form links to preexisting ones depends on both agent degree and opinion
proximity. In parameter value ranges where both factors impact the link choice,
a new phenomenon is observed. Minor clusters continuously form on the periphery
of the opinion space and remain stable for a time, before suddenly merging with
a major cluster in the network. We label these processes as "opinion cascades",
and analyse their origin and behavior. They are triggered by the arrival of
agents acting as "bridges" between the previously disconnected minor and major
clusters. Lastly, we propose theoretical approximations to describe the varying
shapes and merging behavior of opinion cascades under different conditions.


## AI 摘要

本研究探讨了在无标度网络中随时间新增节点的有界置信模型。新节点与现有节点的连接概率同时受到节点度和观点接近度的影响。在特定参数范围内，研究者发现了一种新现象：观点空间边缘会持续形成小型稳定集群，随后突然与网络中的主要集群合并，称为"观点级联"。这种现象由充当"桥梁"的新节点触发，连接了原本分离的大小集群。研究还提出了理论近似方法，用于描述不同条件下观点级联的形态变化和合并行为。
