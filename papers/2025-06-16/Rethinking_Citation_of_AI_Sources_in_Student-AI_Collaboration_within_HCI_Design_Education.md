# Rethinking Citation of AI Sources in Student-AI Collaboration within HCI Design Education

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08467v2

## 原始摘要

The growing integration of AI tools in student design projects presents an
unresolved challenge in HCI education: how should AI-generated content be cited
and documented? Traditional citation frameworks -- grounded in credibility,
retrievability, and authorship -- struggle to accommodate the dynamic and
ephemeral nature of AI outputs. In this paper, we examine how undergraduate
students in a UX design course approached AI usage and citation when given the
freedom to integrate generative tools into their design process. Through
qualitative analysis of 35 team projects and reflections from 175 students, we
identify varied citation practices ranging from formal attribution to indirect
or absent acknowledgment. These inconsistencies reveal gaps in existing
frameworks and raise questions about authorship, assessment, and pedagogical
transparency. We argue for rethinking AI citation as a reflective and
pedagogical practice; one that supports metacognitive engagement by prompting
students to critically evaluate how and why they used AI throughout the design
process. We propose alternative strategies -- such as AI contribution
statements and process-aware citation models that better align with the
iterative and reflective nature of design education. This work invites
educators to reconsider how citation practices can support meaningful
student--AI collaboration.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文探讨了AI工具在学生设计项目中的引用问题。研究发现，传统引用框架难以适应AI内容的动态性和临时性。通过对35个UX设计项目和175名学生反馈的分析，作者观察到学生引用AI的方式参差不齐，从正式标注到间接提及甚至完全不标注。这暴露了现有引用框架的不足，并引发了对作者身份、评估和教学透明度的思考。作者建议将AI引用重构为一种反思性教学实践，通过贡献声明和过程导向的引用模型，帮助学生批判性思考AI在设计过程中的作用。研究呼吁教育者重新思考如何通过引用实践促进有意义的师生-AI协作。
