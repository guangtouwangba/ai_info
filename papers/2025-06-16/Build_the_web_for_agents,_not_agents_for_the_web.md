# Build the web for agents, not agents for the web

## 原始摘要

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.


## AI 摘要

这篇立场论文提出，当前基于大语言模型（LLM）的网络代理面临人机界面不匹配的挑战，主张开发专为AI优化的"代理式网络界面"（AWI）。作者指出现有方法在处理DOM树、截图增强或API交互时存在局限，建议转变思路，设计符合AI特性的新交互范式。AWI设计遵循安全、效率和标准化等六大原则，旨在平衡各方利益，克服传统界面限制，推动更高效可靠的网络代理发展。这一变革需要机器学习社区的广泛协作，为自动化网络任务开辟新途径。
