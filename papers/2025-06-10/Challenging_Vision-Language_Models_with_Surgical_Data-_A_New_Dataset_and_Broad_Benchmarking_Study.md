# Challenging Vision-Language Models with Surgical Data: A New Dataset and Broad Benchmarking Study

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06232v1

## 原始摘要

While traditional computer vision models have historically struggled to
generalize to endoscopic domains, the emergence of foundation models has shown
promising cross-domain performance. In this work, we present the first
large-scale study assessing the capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs)
for endoscopic tasks with a specific focus on laparoscopic surgery. Using a
diverse set of state-of-the-art models, multiple surgical datasets, and
extensive human reference annotations, we address three key research questions:
(1) Can current VLMs solve basic perception tasks on surgical images? (2) Can
they handle advanced frame-based endoscopic scene understanding tasks? and (3)
How do specialized medical VLMs compare to generalist models in this context?
Our results reveal that VLMs can effectively perform basic surgical perception
tasks, such as object counting and localization, with performance levels
comparable to general domain tasks. However, their performance deteriorates
significantly when the tasks require medical knowledge. Notably, we find that
specialized medical VLMs currently underperform compared to generalist models
across both basic and advanced surgical tasks, suggesting that they are not yet
optimized for the complexity of surgical environments. These findings highlight
the need for further advancements to enable VLMs to handle the unique
challenges posed by surgery. Overall, our work provides important insights for
the development of next-generation endoscopic AI systems and identifies key
areas for improvement in medical visual language models.


## AI 摘要

本研究评估了视觉语言模型(VLM)在内窥镜手术任务中的表现，发现VLM能有效完成基本感知任务(如目标计数和定位)，性能与通用领域相当；但在需要医学知识的任务中表现显著下降。值得注意的是，专用医疗VLM目前表现不及通用模型，表明其尚未针对手术环境的复杂性进行优化。研究揭示了VLM在手术领域应用的局限性，强调了需要进一步改进以应对手术特有的挑战。这些发现为下一代内窥镜AI系统开发提供了重要见解，并指出了医疗视觉语言模型的关键改进方向。
