# Supporting Construction Worker Well-Being with a Multi-Agent Conversational AI System

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07997v1

## 原始摘要

The construction industry is characterized by both high physical and
psychological risks, yet supports of mental health remain limited. While
advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language
models (LLMs), offer promising solutions, their potential in construction
remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we developed a
conversational multi-agent system that addresses industry-specific challenges
through an AI-driven approach integrated with domain knowledge. In parallel, it
fulfills construction workers' basic psychological needs by enabling
interactions with multiple agents, each has a distinct persona. This approach
ensures that workers receive both practical problem-solving support and social
engagement, ultimately contributing to their overall well-being. We evaluate
its usability and effectiveness through a within-subjects user study with 12
participants. The results show that our system significantly outperforms the
single-agent baseline, achieving improvements of 18% in usability, 40% in
self-determination, 60% in social presence, and 60% in trust. These findings
highlight the promise of LLM-driven AI systems in providing domain-specific
support for construction workers.


## AI 摘要

该研究开发了一个基于大语言模型(LLMs)的多智能体对话系统，旨在解决建筑行业工人的心理健康需求。系统通过集成领域知识和多个具有不同角色的智能体，既提供实际问题解决方案，又满足工人的社交需求。对12名参与者的用户研究表明，相比单智能体基线，该系统在可用性(提升18%)、自主性(40%)、社交临场感(60%)和信任度(60%)方面均有显著改善。这些发现凸显了LLM驱动系统在建筑行业心理健康支持方面的潜力，为这个高风险行业提供了创新的心理支持方案。
