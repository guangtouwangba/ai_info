# Supporting Construction Worker Well-Being with a Multi-Agent Conversational AI System

## 原始摘要

The construction industry is characterized by both high physical and
psychological risks, yet supports of mental health remain limited. While
advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language
models (LLMs), offer promising solutions, their potential in construction
remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we developed a
conversational multi-agent system that addresses industry-specific challenges
through an AI-driven approach integrated with domain knowledge. In parallel, it
fulfills construction workers' basic psychological needs by enabling
interactions with multiple agents, each has a distinct persona. This approach
ensures that workers receive both practical problem-solving support and social
engagement, ultimately contributing to their overall well-being. We evaluate
its usability and effectiveness through a within-subjects user study with 12
participants. The results show that our system significantly outperforms the
single-agent baseline, achieving improvements of 18% in usability, 40% in
self-determination, 60% in social presence, and 60% in trust. These findings
highlight the promise of LLM-driven AI systems in providing domain-specific
support for construction workers.


## AI 摘要

建筑行业存在较高的身心风险，但心理健康支持不足。研究开发了一个结合领域知识的对话式多智能体系统，通过不同角色的AI代理为工人提供实际问题解决和社交互动支持。用户研究（12人参与）显示，该系统显著优于单代理基线：可用性提升18%，自主性提高40%，社交临场感增强60%，信任度提升60%。结果表明，基于大语言模型的AI系统能有效满足建筑工人的心理需求，改善其福祉。该研究填补了AI在建筑领域心理健康应用的空白，展现了多智能体系统在行业特定支持中的潜力。
