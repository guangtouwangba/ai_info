# Supporting Construction Worker Well-Being with a Multi-Agent Conversational AI System

## 原始摘要

The construction industry is characterized by both high physical and
psychological risks, yet supports of mental health remain limited. While
advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language
models (LLMs), offer promising solutions, their potential in construction
remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we developed a
conversational multi-agent system that addresses industry-specific challenges
through an AI-driven approach integrated with domain knowledge. In parallel, it
fulfills construction workers' basic psychological needs by enabling
interactions with multiple agents, each has a distinct persona. This approach
ensures that workers receive both practical problem-solving support and social
engagement, ultimately contributing to their overall well-being. We evaluate
its usability and effectiveness through a within-subjects user study with 12
participants. The results show that our system significantly outperforms the
single-agent baseline, achieving improvements of 18% in usability, 40% in
self-determination, 60% in social presence, and 60% in trust. These findings
highlight the promise of LLM-driven AI systems in providing domain-specific
support for construction workers.


## AI 摘要

建筑行业存在较高的身心风险，但心理健康支持有限。本研究开发了一个基于大语言模型(LLM)的多智能体对话系统，通过整合行业知识解决实际问题，同时满足工人的心理需求。系统设计了不同个性的智能体，既提供专业支持又促进社交互动。12人参与的用户研究表明，相比单智能体基线，该系统在可用性(提升18%)、自主性(40%)、社交临场感(60%)和信任度(60%)方面均有显著改善。这验证了LLM驱动系统为建筑工人提供专业心理支持的潜力。
