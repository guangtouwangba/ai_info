# Supporting Construction Worker Well-Being with a Multi-Agent Conversational AI System

## 原始摘要

The construction industry is characterized by both high physical and
psychological risks, yet supports of mental health remain limited. While
advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language
models (LLMs), offer promising solutions, their potential in construction
remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we developed a
conversational multi-agent system that addresses industry-specific challenges
through an AI-driven approach integrated with domain knowledge. In parallel, it
fulfills construction workers' basic psychological needs by enabling
interactions with multiple agents, each has a distinct persona. This approach
ensures that workers receive both practical problem-solving support and social
engagement, ultimately contributing to their overall well-being. We evaluate
its usability and effectiveness through a within-subjects user study with 12
participants. The results show that our system significantly outperforms the
single-agent baseline, achieving improvements of 18% in usability, 40% in
self-determination, 60% in social presence, and 60% in trust. These findings
highlight the promise of LLM-driven AI systems in providing domain-specific
support for construction workers.


## AI 摘要

建筑行业存在较高的身心风险，但心理健康支持不足。本研究开发了一种基于大语言模型(LLM)的多智能体对话系统，通过整合专业知识解决行业问题，同时满足工人的基本心理需求。系统设计了不同角色的智能体，既提供实际问题支持，也促进社交互动。12人参与的用户研究表明，该系统显著优于单智能体基线：可用性提升18%，自主性提高40%，社交临场感增强60%，信任度提升60%。结果表明，LLM驱动的AI系统有望为建筑工人提供专业支持，改善其心理健康状况。
