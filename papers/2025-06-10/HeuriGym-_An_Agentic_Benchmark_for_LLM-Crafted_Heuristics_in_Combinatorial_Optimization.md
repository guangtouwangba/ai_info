# HeuriGym: An Agentic Benchmark for LLM-Crafted Heuristics in Combinatorial Optimization

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07972v1

## 原始摘要

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements
in reasoning and agent-based problem-solving, current evaluation methodologies
fail to adequately assess their capabilities: existing benchmarks either rely
on closed-ended questions prone to saturation and memorization, or subjective
comparisons that lack consistency and rigor. In this work, we introduce
HeuriGym, an agentic framework designed for evaluating heuristic algorithms
generated by LLMs for combinatorial optimization problems, characterized by
clearly defined objectives and expansive solution spaces. HeuriGym empowers
LLMs to propose heuristics, receive evaluative feedback via code execution, and
iteratively refine their solutions. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art models on
nine problems across domains such as computer systems, logistics, and biology,
exposing persistent limitations in tool use, planning, and adaptive reasoning.
To quantify performance, we propose the Quality-Yield Index (QYI), a metric
that captures both solution pass rate and quality. Even top models like
GPT-o4-mini-high and Gemini-2.5-Pro attain QYI scores of only 0.6, well below
the expert baseline of 1. Our open-source benchmark aims to guide the
development of LLMs toward more effective and realistic problem-solving in
scientific and engineering domains.


## AI 摘要

该研究提出了HeuriGym框架，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）在组合优化问题中的启发式算法生成能力。该框架通过代码执行提供反馈，支持LLMs迭代优化方案。研究测试了9个前沿模型在计算机系统、物流和生物学等领域的9个问题，揭示了LLMs在工具使用、规划和自适应推理方面的局限。研究引入质量-产出指数（QYI）量化性能，发现最佳模型（如GPT-4-mini-high和Gemini-2.5-Pro）的QYI仅为0.6，远低于专家基线1.0。开源基准旨在推动LLMs在科学和工程领域更有效的实际应用。
