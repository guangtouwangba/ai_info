# HeuriGym: An Agentic Benchmark for LLM-Crafted Heuristics in Combinatorial Optimization

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07972v1

## 原始摘要

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements
in reasoning and agent-based problem-solving, current evaluation methodologies
fail to adequately assess their capabilities: existing benchmarks either rely
on closed-ended questions prone to saturation and memorization, or subjective
comparisons that lack consistency and rigor. In this work, we introduce
HeuriGym, an agentic framework designed for evaluating heuristic algorithms
generated by LLMs for combinatorial optimization problems, characterized by
clearly defined objectives and expansive solution spaces. HeuriGym empowers
LLMs to propose heuristics, receive evaluative feedback via code execution, and
iteratively refine their solutions. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art models on
nine problems across domains such as computer systems, logistics, and biology,
exposing persistent limitations in tool use, planning, and adaptive reasoning.
To quantify performance, we propose the Quality-Yield Index (QYI), a metric
that captures both solution pass rate and quality. Even top models like
GPT-o4-mini-high and Gemini-2.5-Pro attain QYI scores of only 0.6, well below
the expert baseline of 1. Our open-source benchmark aims to guide the
development of LLMs toward more effective and realistic problem-solving in
scientific and engineering domains.


## AI 摘要

该论文提出了HeuriGym框架，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）在组合优化问题中生成启发式算法的能力。该框架通过代码执行提供反馈，让LLMs能迭代改进解决方案。研究测试了9个前沿模型在计算机系统、物流和生物学等领域的9个问题，揭示了LLMs在工具使用、规划和适应性推理方面的局限。作者提出了质量-产出指数（QYI）来量化性能，结合通过率和解决方案质量。结果显示，即使是GPT-4和Gemini-2.5-Pro等顶级模型，QYI得分仅为0.6，远低于专家基准1。该开源基准旨在推动LLMs在科学和工程领域的实际应用。
