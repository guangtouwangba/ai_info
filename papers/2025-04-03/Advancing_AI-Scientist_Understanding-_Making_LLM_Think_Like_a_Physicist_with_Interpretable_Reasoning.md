# Advancing AI-Scientist Understanding: Making LLM Think Like a Physicist with Interpretable Reasoning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01911v1

## 原始摘要

Large Language Models (LLMs) are playing an expanding role in physics
research by enhancing reasoning, symbolic manipulation, and numerical
computation. However, ensuring the reliability and interpretability of their
outputs remains a significant challenge. In our framework, we conceptualize the
collaboration between AI and human scientists as a dynamic interplay among
three modules: the reasoning module, the interpretation module, and the
AI-scientist interaction module. Recognizing that effective physics reasoning
demands rigorous logical consistency, quantitative precision, and deep
integration with established theoretical models, we introduce the
interpretation module to improve the understanding of AI-generated outputs,
which is not previously explored in the literature. This module comprises
multiple specialized agents, including summarizers, model builders, UI
builders, and testers, which collaboratively structure LLM outputs within a
physically grounded framework, by constructing a more interpretable science
model. A case study demonstrates that our approach enhances transparency,
facilitates validation, and strengthens AI-augmented reasoning in scientific
discovery.


## AI 摘要

大语言模型(LLMs)在物理研究中正发挥日益重要的作用，但确保其输出的可靠性和可解释性仍具挑战。本研究提出由推理模块、解释模块和人机交互模块组成的协作框架，重点关注以往未被深入研究的解释模块。该模块包含摘要生成、模型构建、界面开发和测试等专业代理，能协同构建基于物理基础的可解释科学模型。案例研究表明，该方法能增强透明度、促进验证，并强化AI辅助的科学推理能力。研究特别强调物理推理所需的逻辑一致性、定量精确性以及与理论模型的深度整合。
