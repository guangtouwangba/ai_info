# Advancing AI-Scientist Understanding: Making LLM Think Like a Physicist with Interpretable Reasoning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01911v1

## 原始摘要

Large Language Models (LLMs) are playing an expanding role in physics
research by enhancing reasoning, symbolic manipulation, and numerical
computation. However, ensuring the reliability and interpretability of their
outputs remains a significant challenge. In our framework, we conceptualize the
collaboration between AI and human scientists as a dynamic interplay among
three modules: the reasoning module, the interpretation module, and the
AI-scientist interaction module. Recognizing that effective physics reasoning
demands rigorous logical consistency, quantitative precision, and deep
integration with established theoretical models, we introduce the
interpretation module to improve the understanding of AI-generated outputs,
which is not previously explored in the literature. This module comprises
multiple specialized agents, including summarizers, model builders, UI
builders, and testers, which collaboratively structure LLM outputs within a
physically grounded framework, by constructing a more interpretable science
model. A case study demonstrates that our approach enhances transparency,
facilitates validation, and strengthens AI-augmented reasoning in scientific
discovery.


## AI 摘要

大语言模型(LLMs)在物理研究中通过增强推理、符号运算和数值计算发挥重要作用，但其输出的可靠性和可解释性仍是挑战。本研究提出由推理模块、解释模块和人机交互模块组成的协作框架，其中创新的解释模块包含多个专业代理(如总结器、模型构建器等)，将LLM输出转化为基于物理的可解释科学模型。案例研究表明，该方法提高了AI辅助科学发现的透明度，便于验证，强化了推理能力。该框架首次系统探索了物理研究中AI输出的解释性问题，为可靠的科学AI协作提供了新思路。
