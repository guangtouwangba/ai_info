# Advancing AI-Scientist Understanding: Making LLM Think Like a Physicist with Interpretable Reasoning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01911v1

## 原始摘要

Large Language Models (LLMs) are playing an expanding role in physics
research by enhancing reasoning, symbolic manipulation, and numerical
computation. However, ensuring the reliability and interpretability of their
outputs remains a significant challenge. In our framework, we conceptualize the
collaboration between AI and human scientists as a dynamic interplay among
three modules: the reasoning module, the interpretation module, and the
AI-scientist interaction module. Recognizing that effective physics reasoning
demands rigorous logical consistency, quantitative precision, and deep
integration with established theoretical models, we introduce the
interpretation module to improve the understanding of AI-generated outputs,
which is not previously explored in the literature. This module comprises
multiple specialized agents, including summarizers, model builders, UI
builders, and testers, which collaboratively structure LLM outputs within a
physically grounded framework, by constructing a more interpretable science
model. A case study demonstrates that our approach enhances transparency,
facilitates validation, and strengthens AI-augmented reasoning in scientific
discovery.


## AI 摘要

该研究提出一个由推理模块、解释模块和人机交互模块组成的框架，旨在提升大语言模型(LLMs)在物理研究中的可靠性和可解释性。其中创新的解释模块包含多个专业代理(如总结器、模型构建器等)，通过建立可解释的科学模型来结构化LLM输出。案例研究表明，该方法能增强AI辅助科学推理的透明度，便于验证，并促进与现有理论模型的深度融合。研究特别强调了物理推理所需的逻辑一致性、定量精确性等关键要求，这是以往文献未充分探索的方向。
