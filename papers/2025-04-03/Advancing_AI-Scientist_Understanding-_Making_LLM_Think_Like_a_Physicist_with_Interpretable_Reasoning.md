# Advancing AI-Scientist Understanding: Making LLM Think Like a Physicist with Interpretable Reasoning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01911v1

## 原始摘要

Large Language Models (LLMs) are playing an expanding role in physics
research by enhancing reasoning, symbolic manipulation, and numerical
computation. However, ensuring the reliability and interpretability of their
outputs remains a significant challenge. In our framework, we conceptualize the
collaboration between AI and human scientists as a dynamic interplay among
three modules: the reasoning module, the interpretation module, and the
AI-scientist interaction module. Recognizing that effective physics reasoning
demands rigorous logical consistency, quantitative precision, and deep
integration with established theoretical models, we introduce the
interpretation module to improve the understanding of AI-generated outputs,
which is not previously explored in the literature. This module comprises
multiple specialized agents, including summarizers, model builders, UI
builders, and testers, which collaboratively structure LLM outputs within a
physically grounded framework, by constructing a more interpretable science
model. A case study demonstrates that our approach enhances transparency,
facilitates validation, and strengthens AI-augmented reasoning in scientific
discovery.


## AI 摘要

该研究提出一个AI与物理学家协作的新框架，包含推理模块、解释模块和人机交互模块。针对大语言模型(LLMs)在物理研究中可靠性不足的问题，研究特别设计了创新的解释模块，通过总结器、模型构建器、界面构建器和测试器等专业代理，将LLM输出结构化到物理框架中，建立可解释的科学模型。案例研究表明，该方法能提升AI输出的透明度，便于验证，强化了AI辅助科学发现的能力。研究首次系统探索了AI生成结果的解释性问题，为物理研究中的人机协作提供了新思路。
