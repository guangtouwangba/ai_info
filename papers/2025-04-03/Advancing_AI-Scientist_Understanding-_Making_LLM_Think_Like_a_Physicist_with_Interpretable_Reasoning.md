# Advancing AI-Scientist Understanding: Making LLM Think Like a Physicist with Interpretable Reasoning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01911v1

## 原始摘要

Large Language Models (LLMs) are playing an expanding role in physics
research by enhancing reasoning, symbolic manipulation, and numerical
computation. However, ensuring the reliability and interpretability of their
outputs remains a significant challenge. In our framework, we conceptualize the
collaboration between AI and human scientists as a dynamic interplay among
three modules: the reasoning module, the interpretation module, and the
AI-scientist interaction module. Recognizing that effective physics reasoning
demands rigorous logical consistency, quantitative precision, and deep
integration with established theoretical models, we introduce the
interpretation module to improve the understanding of AI-generated outputs,
which is not previously explored in the literature. This module comprises
multiple specialized agents, including summarizers, model builders, UI
builders, and testers, which collaboratively structure LLM outputs within a
physically grounded framework, by constructing a more interpretable science
model. A case study demonstrates that our approach enhances transparency,
facilitates validation, and strengthens AI-augmented reasoning in scientific
discovery.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文提出了一个提升大语言模型(LLMs)在物理研究中可靠性和可解释性的框架。该框架包含三个模块：推理模块、解释模块和人机交互模块，其中创新的解释模块通过多个专业代理(如总结器、模型构建器等)协作，将LLM输出结构化到物理基础框架中，构建更易解释的科学模型。研究表明，这种方法能增强透明度，便于验证，并强化AI辅助的科学推理。案例验证了该框架在提高输出可解释性和促进科学发现方面的有效性，解决了现有研究中AI输出难以理解的问题。
