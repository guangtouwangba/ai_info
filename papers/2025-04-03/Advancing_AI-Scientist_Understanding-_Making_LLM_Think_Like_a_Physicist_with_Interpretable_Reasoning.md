# Advancing AI-Scientist Understanding: Making LLM Think Like a Physicist with Interpretable Reasoning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01911v1

## 原始摘要

Large Language Models (LLMs) are playing an expanding role in physics
research by enhancing reasoning, symbolic manipulation, and numerical
computation. However, ensuring the reliability and interpretability of their
outputs remains a significant challenge. In our framework, we conceptualize the
collaboration between AI and human scientists as a dynamic interplay among
three modules: the reasoning module, the interpretation module, and the
AI-scientist interaction module. Recognizing that effective physics reasoning
demands rigorous logical consistency, quantitative precision, and deep
integration with established theoretical models, we introduce the
interpretation module to improve the understanding of AI-generated outputs,
which is not previously explored in the literature. This module comprises
multiple specialized agents, including summarizers, model builders, UI
builders, and testers, which collaboratively structure LLM outputs within a
physically grounded framework, by constructing a more interpretable science
model. A case study demonstrates that our approach enhances transparency,
facilitates validation, and strengthens AI-augmented reasoning in scientific
discovery.


## AI 摘要

该研究提出了一个AI与物理学家协作的新框架，包含推理模块、解释模块和人机交互模块。针对大语言模型(LLM)在物理研究中可靠性不足的问题，创新性地引入了解释模块，通过总结器、模型构建器等专业代理，将LLM输出结构化到物理理论框架中，提升结果的可解释性。研究表明，该方法能增强AI辅助科学推理的透明度，便于验证，并促进科学发现。案例验证了该框架在保持逻辑一致性、数值精度和理论整合方面的有效性，为解决AI在科学研究中的可解释性挑战提供了新思路。
