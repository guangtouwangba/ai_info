# Advancing AI-Scientist Understanding: Making LLM Think Like a Physicist with Interpretable Reasoning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01911v1

## 原始摘要

Large Language Models (LLMs) are playing an expanding role in physics
research by enhancing reasoning, symbolic manipulation, and numerical
computation. However, ensuring the reliability and interpretability of their
outputs remains a significant challenge. In our framework, we conceptualize the
collaboration between AI and human scientists as a dynamic interplay among
three modules: the reasoning module, the interpretation module, and the
AI-scientist interaction module. Recognizing that effective physics reasoning
demands rigorous logical consistency, quantitative precision, and deep
integration with established theoretical models, we introduce the
interpretation module to improve the understanding of AI-generated outputs,
which is not previously explored in the literature. This module comprises
multiple specialized agents, including summarizers, model builders, UI
builders, and testers, which collaboratively structure LLM outputs within a
physically grounded framework, by constructing a more interpretable science
model. A case study demonstrates that our approach enhances transparency,
facilitates validation, and strengthens AI-augmented reasoning in scientific
discovery.


## AI 摘要

大型语言模型(LLMs)在物理研究中正发挥日益重要的作用，但其输出的可靠性和可解释性仍面临挑战。本研究提出由推理模块、解释模块和人机交互模块组成的协作框架，特别创新性地引入了解释模块。该模块包含摘要生成、模型构建、界面设计和测试等专业代理，通过构建可解释的科学模型来结构化LLM输出。案例研究表明，该方法能提高透明度、便于验证，并增强科学发现中AI辅助推理的能力，解决了现有研究未充分探索的AI输出理解问题。
