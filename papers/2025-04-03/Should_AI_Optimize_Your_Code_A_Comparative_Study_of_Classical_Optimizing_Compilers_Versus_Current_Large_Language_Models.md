## 原始摘要

Traditional optimizing compilers have played an important role in adapting to
the growing complexity of modern software systems. The need for efficient
parallel programming in current architectures requires strong optimization
techniques. The beginning of Large Language Models (LLMs) raises intriguing
questions about the potential of these AI approaches to revolutionize code
optimization methodologies. This work aims to answer an essential question for
the compiler community: "Can AI-driven models revolutionize the way we approach
code optimization?".
  To address this question, we present a comparative analysis between three
classical optimizing compilers and two recent large language models, evaluating
their respective abilities and limitations in optimizing code for maximum
efficiency. In addition, we introduce a benchmark suite of challenging
optimization patterns and an automatic mechanism for evaluating the performance
and correctness of the code generated by LLMs. We used three different
prompting strategies to evaluate the performance of the LLMs, Simple
Instruction (IP), Detailed Instruction Prompting (DIP), and Chain of Thought
(CoT).
  A key finding is that while LLMs have the potential to outperform current
optimizing compilers, they often generate incorrect code on large code sizes,
calling for automated verification methods. In addition, expressing a compiler
strategy as part of the LLMs prompt substantially improves its overall
performance. Our evaluation across three benchmark suites shows CodeLlama-70B
as the superior LLM, capable of achieving speedups of up to x1.75.
Additionally, CETUS is the best among the current optimizing compilers,
achieving a maximum speedup of 1.67x. We also found substantial differences
among the three prompting strategies.


## AI 摘要

传统优化编译器在现代软件系统中扮演重要角色，而高效并行编程的需求催生了强大的优化技术。本研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）能否革新代码优化方法，通过对比三个经典优化编译器与两个LLMs的性能。研究引入了具有挑战性的优化模式基准套件和自动评估机制，测试了三种提示策略（简单指令、详细指令和思维链）。结果显示，LLMs（如CodeLlama-70B）潜力显著（最高加速1.75倍），但大代码量时易出错，需自动化验证。优化策略融入提示可显著提升性能。最佳传统编译器CETUS加速1.67倍，不同提示策略效果差异显著。
