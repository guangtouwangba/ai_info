# Graphon games and an idealized limit of large network games

## 原始摘要

Graphon games are a class of games with a continuum of agents, introduced to
approximate the strategic interactions in large network games. The first result
of this study is an equilibrium existence theorem in graphon games, under the
same conditions as those in network games. We prove the existence of an
equilibrium in a graphon game with an infinite-dimensional strategy space,
under the continuity and quasi-concavity of the utility functions. The second
result characterizes Nash equilibria in graphon games as the limit points of
asymptotic Nash equilibria in large network games. If a sequence of large
network games converges to a graphon game, any convergent sequence of
asymptotic Nash equilibria in these large network games also converges to a
Nash equilibrium of the graphon game. In addition, for any graphon game and its
equilibrium, there exists a sequence of large network games that converges to
the graphon game and has asymptotic Nash equilibria converging to the
equilibrium. These results suggest that the concept of a graphon game is an
idealized limit of large network games as the number of players tends to
infinity.

本研究证明了图子博弈（graphon games）在无限维策略空间下，当效用函数满足连续性和拟凹性时存在纳什均衡，其条件与网络博弈相同。研究还表明，图子博弈的纳什均衡可作为大型网络博弈渐近纳什均衡的极限点：当网络博弈序列收敛于图子博弈时，其渐近均衡的收敛点即为图子博弈的均衡；反之，任意图子博弈均衡都可找到对应的收敛网络博弈序列及其渐近均衡。这些结论表明，图子博弈是玩家数量趋近无限时大型网络博弈的理想化极限模型。
