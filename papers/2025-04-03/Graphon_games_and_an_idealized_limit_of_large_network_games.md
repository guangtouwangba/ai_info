# Graphon games and an idealized limit of large network games

## 原始摘要

Graphon games are a class of games with a continuum of agents, introduced to
approximate the strategic interactions in large network games. The first result
of this study is an equilibrium existence theorem in graphon games, under the
same conditions as those in network games. We prove the existence of an
equilibrium in a graphon game with an infinite-dimensional strategy space,
under the continuity and quasi-concavity of the utility functions. The second
result characterizes Nash equilibria in graphon games as the limit points of
asymptotic Nash equilibria in large network games. If a sequence of large
network games converges to a graphon game, any convergent sequence of
asymptotic Nash equilibria in these large network games also converges to a
Nash equilibrium of the graphon game. In addition, for any graphon game and its
equilibrium, there exists a sequence of large network games that converges to
the graphon game and has asymptotic Nash equilibria converging to the
equilibrium. These results suggest that the concept of a graphon game is an
idealized limit of large network games as the number of players tends to
infinity.

本研究证明了图博弈（graphon games）在效用函数连续且拟凹条件下存在均衡，并表明图博弈可作为大型网络博弈的极限模型。主要结论包括：1）在无限维策略空间中，图博弈存在均衡；2）图博弈的纳什均衡是大型网络博弈渐近均衡的极限点。当网络博弈序列收敛于图博弈时，其渐近均衡序列也收敛于图博弈的均衡；反之，对任意图博弈均衡，存在收敛于该均衡的网络博弈序列。这些结果表明图博弈是玩家数量趋近无限时大型网络博弈的理想极限模型。（100字）
