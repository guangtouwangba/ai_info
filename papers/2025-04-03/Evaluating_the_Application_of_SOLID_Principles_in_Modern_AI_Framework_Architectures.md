# Evaluating the Application of SOLID Principles in Modern AI Framework Architectures

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13786v2

## 原始摘要

This research evaluates the extent to which modern AI frameworks,
specifically TensorFlow and scikit-learn, adhere to the SOLID design principles
- Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface
Segregation, and Dependency Inversion. Analyzing the frameworks architectural
documentation and design philosophies, this research investigates architectural
trade-offs when balancing software engineering best practices with AI-specific
needs. I examined each frameworks documentation, source code, and architectural
components to evaluate their adherence to these principles. The results show
that both frameworks adopt certain aspects of SOLID design principles but make
intentional trade-offs to address performance, scalability, and the
experimental nature of AI development. TensorFlow focuses on performance and
scalability, sometimes sacrificing strict adherence to principles like Single
Responsibility and Interface Segregation. While scikit-learns design philosophy
aligns more closely with SOLID principles through consistent interfaces and
composition principles, sticking closer to SOLID guidelines but with occasional
deviations for performance optimizations and scalability. This research
discovered that applying SOLID principles in AI frameworks depends on context,
as performance, scalability, and flexibility often require deviations from
traditional software engineering principles. This research contributes to
understanding how domain-specific constraints influence architectural decisions
in modern AI frameworks and how these frameworks strategically adapted design
choices to effectively balance these contradicting requirements.


## AI 摘要

该研究评估了TensorFlow和scikit-learn两大AI框架对SOLID设计原则的遵循程度。分析发现，两个框架在性能、可扩展性和AI开发特性之间做出权衡：TensorFlow为性能牺牲了单一职责和接口隔离原则；scikit-learn更贴近SOLID原则，但也会为性能优化偏离规范。研究表明，AI框架需要根据具体场景灵活应用软件工程原则，性能需求和领域特性常导致对传统原则的调整。该研究揭示了AI框架如何通过战略性的设计选择来平衡相互矛盾的需求，为理解领域限制对架构决策的影响提供了新见解。（99字）
