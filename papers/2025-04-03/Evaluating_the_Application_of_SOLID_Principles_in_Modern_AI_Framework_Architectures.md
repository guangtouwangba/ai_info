# Evaluating the Application of SOLID Principles in Modern AI Framework Architectures

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13786v2

## 原始摘要

This research evaluates the extent to which modern AI frameworks,
specifically TensorFlow and scikit-learn, adhere to the SOLID design principles
- Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface
Segregation, and Dependency Inversion. Analyzing the frameworks architectural
documentation and design philosophies, this research investigates architectural
trade-offs when balancing software engineering best practices with AI-specific
needs. I examined each frameworks documentation, source code, and architectural
components to evaluate their adherence to these principles. The results show
that both frameworks adopt certain aspects of SOLID design principles but make
intentional trade-offs to address performance, scalability, and the
experimental nature of AI development. TensorFlow focuses on performance and
scalability, sometimes sacrificing strict adherence to principles like Single
Responsibility and Interface Segregation. While scikit-learns design philosophy
aligns more closely with SOLID principles through consistent interfaces and
composition principles, sticking closer to SOLID guidelines but with occasional
deviations for performance optimizations and scalability. This research
discovered that applying SOLID principles in AI frameworks depends on context,
as performance, scalability, and flexibility often require deviations from
traditional software engineering principles. This research contributes to
understanding how domain-specific constraints influence architectural decisions
in modern AI frameworks and how these frameworks strategically adapted design
choices to effectively balance these contradicting requirements.


## AI 摘要

本研究评估了TensorFlow和scikit-learn两大AI框架对SOLID设计原则（单一职责、开闭原则、里氏替换、接口隔离和依赖倒置）的遵循程度。分析发现，两个框架为兼顾AI开发的性能、可扩展性和实验性需求，均对SOLID原则进行了策略性取舍：TensorFlow更侧重性能与扩展性，在单一职责和接口隔离上有所妥协；scikit-learn通过统一接口和组合原则更贴近SOLID，但仍存在性能优化导致的偏离。研究表明，AI框架需根据具体场景权衡传统软件工程原则与领域特殊需求，这对理解AI框架的架构决策具有重要启示。（99字）
