**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19027v2

## 原始摘要

Code generation by Llama 3.1 models, such as Meta's Llama 3.1 405B,
represents a significant advancement in the field of artificial intelligence,
particularly in natural language processing and programming automation. This
paper explores the capabilities and applications of Llama-driven code
generation, highlighting its ability to translate natural language prompts into
executable code across multiple programming languages. Key features include
contextual awareness, multi-language support, and enhanced debugging and
optimization functionalities. By examining these aspects, we illustrate how
Llama can serve as a versatile tool for developers of all skill levels,
improving productivity and efficiency in software development. The potential
implications for education, industry, and the future of coding practices are
also discussed, underscoring the transformative impact of AI in programming.
Experimentation shows that while Llama 3.1 405B performs well with simple
algorithmic and data structure based problems, it still struggles with problems
on Quantum Computing, Bioinformatics, and Artificial Intelligence.
