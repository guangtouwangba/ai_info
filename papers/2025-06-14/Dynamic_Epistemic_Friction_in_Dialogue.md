# Dynamic Epistemic Friction in Dialogue

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10934v1

## 原始摘要

Recent developments in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
preferences have significantly enhanced their utility in human-AI collaborative
scenarios. However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of
"epistemic friction," or the inherent resistance encountered when updating
beliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this
paper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic
integration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current
belief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position
this within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit,
2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the
interaction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that
demonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief
updates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief
alignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be
made more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue
scenarios.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了"认知摩擦"在人类与AI协作中的重要性，即智能体在面对新信息时更新信念的内在阻力。作者将动态认知摩擦定义为当前信念状态与外部证据支持的新命题之间的错位，并在动态认知逻辑框架下建模这种非平凡的信念修正过程。通过协作任务分析，该模型能有效预测对话中的信念更新。研究还讨论了如何进一步完善这一模型，以更好地适应现实对话场景的复杂性，为提升大语言模型与人类偏好的对齐提供了新视角。
