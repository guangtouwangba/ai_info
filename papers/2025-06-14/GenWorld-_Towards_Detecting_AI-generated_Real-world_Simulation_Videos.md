## 原始摘要

The flourishing of video generation technologies has endangered the
credibility of real-world information and intensified the demand for
AI-generated video detectors. Despite some progress, the lack of high-quality
real-world datasets hinders the development of trustworthy detectors. In this
paper, we propose GenWorld, a large-scale, high-quality, and real-world
simulation dataset for AI-generated video detection. GenWorld features the
following characteristics: (1) Real-world Simulation: GenWorld focuses on
videos that replicate real-world scenarios, which have a significant impact due
to their realism and potential influence; (2) High Quality: GenWorld employs
multiple state-of-the-art video generation models to provide realistic and
high-quality forged videos; (3) Cross-prompt Diversity: GenWorld includes
videos generated from diverse generators and various prompt modalities (e.g.,
text, image, video), offering the potential to learn more generalizable
forensic features. We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect
high-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing
potential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues. To address this, we propose a
simple yet effective model, SpannDetector, to leverage multi-view consistency
as a strong criterion for real-world AI-generated video detection. Experiments
show that our method achieves superior results, highlighting a promising
direction for explainable AI-generated video detection based on physical
plausibility. We believe that GenWorld will advance the field of AI-generated
video detection. Project Page: https://chen-wl20.github.io/GenWorld


## AI 摘要

随着AI视频生成技术的快速发展，真实信息的可信度面临威胁，对AI生成视频检测的需求日益迫切。然而，高质量真实世界数据集的缺乏阻碍了可靠检测器的发展。为此，研究团队提出GenWorld——一个大规模、高质量、模拟真实场景的AI生成视频检测数据集，其特点包括：真实场景模拟、多先进模型生成的高质量伪造视频，以及跨生成器和多提示模态的多样性。研究发现现有方法难以检测世界模型生成的视频，团队进而提出SpannDetector模型，利用多视角一致性作为检测标准，实验显示其效果显著。该数据集有望推动AI生成视频检测领域发展。
