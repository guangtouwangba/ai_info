## 原始摘要

The flourishing of video generation technologies has endangered the
credibility of real-world information and intensified the demand for
AI-generated video detectors. Despite some progress, the lack of high-quality
real-world datasets hinders the development of trustworthy detectors. In this
paper, we propose GenWorld, a large-scale, high-quality, and real-world
simulation dataset for AI-generated video detection. GenWorld features the
following characteristics: (1) Real-world Simulation: GenWorld focuses on
videos that replicate real-world scenarios, which have a significant impact due
to their realism and potential influence; (2) High Quality: GenWorld employs
multiple state-of-the-art video generation models to provide realistic and
high-quality forged videos; (3) Cross-prompt Diversity: GenWorld includes
videos generated from diverse generators and various prompt modalities (e.g.,
text, image, video), offering the potential to learn more generalizable
forensic features. We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect
high-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing
potential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues. To address this, we propose a
simple yet effective model, SpannDetector, to leverage multi-view consistency
as a strong criterion for real-world AI-generated video detection. Experiments
show that our method achieves superior results, highlighting a promising
direction for explainable AI-generated video detection based on physical
plausibility. We believe that GenWorld will advance the field of AI-generated
video detection. Project Page: https://chen-wl20.github.io/GenWorld


## AI 摘要

随着AI视频生成技术的快速发展，其可能对真实信息可信度造成的威胁引发了业界对检测技术的迫切需求。针对现有高质量真实场景数据集的匮乏，研究团队提出GenWorld——一个大规模、高质量、模拟真实场景的AI生成视频检测数据集。该数据集具有三大特点：(1)真实场景模拟；(2)采用多款先进视频生成模型；(3)涵盖多种生成方式和提示模态。研究发现现有方法难以检测世界模型生成的视频，团队因此提出SpannDetector模型，通过多视角一致性检测实现更优效果。实验证明该方法为基于物理合理性的可解释AI视频检测提供了新方向。
