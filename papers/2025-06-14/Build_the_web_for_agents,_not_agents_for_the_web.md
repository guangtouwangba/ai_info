# Build the web for agents, not agents for the web

## 原始摘要

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.


## AI 摘要

当前大语言模型(LLMs)和多模态模型的发展推动了网页代理(能自主浏览和完成网页任务的AI系统)的研究。然而，现有方法因网页界面设计与LLM能力不匹配而面临挑战，如处理复杂DOM树、依赖增强截图或绕过界面直接调用API。本文提出应转向专为代理优化的新型交互范式——"代理式网页界面"(AWI)，并制定了六项设计原则，强调安全性、效率和标准化，以平衡各方利益。这一转变旨在克服现有界面的根本局限，推动更高效、可靠和透明的网页代理设计，需要机器学习社区的广泛协作。
