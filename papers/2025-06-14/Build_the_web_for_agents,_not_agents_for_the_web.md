# Build the web for agents, not agents for the web

## 原始摘要

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.


## AI 摘要

当前大语言模型(LLMs)和多模态模型的发展推动了网页代理(Web Agent)的研究，但现有方法面临网页界面与LLM能力不匹配的挑战。本文提出范式转变：应开发专为AI代理优化的新型交互界面——代理式网页界面(AWI)，而非让代理适应人类界面。AWI设计遵循安全性、效率和标准化等六大原则，兼顾各方利益。这一重构旨在克服现有界面的根本局限，推动更高效、可靠和透明的网页代理发展，需要机器学习社区的广泛协作。
