# Build the web for agents, not agents for the web

## 原始摘要

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.


## AI 摘要

这篇立场论文主张改变网页代理的研究范式，提出应开发专为AI代理优化的"代理式网页界面"(AWI)，而非让人工智能适应人类设计的界面。当前基于大语言模型(LLM)的网页代理面临核心挑战：处理复杂DOM树、依赖增强截图或通过API绕过界面等现有方法都存在根本性局限。AWI设计遵循安全、效率和标准化等六大原则，旨在平衡各方利益。这种新范式有望突破现有界面的限制，推动更高效、可靠和透明的网页代理发展，需要机器学习社区的广泛协作来实现这一转变。
