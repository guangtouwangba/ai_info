# Build the web for agents, not agents for the web

## 原始摘要

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.


## AI 摘要

当前大语言模型（LLM）和多模态技术的发展推动了网页智能代理的研究，但现有方法因网页界面设计与LLM能力不匹配而面临挑战。传统方式（如处理DOM树、依赖截图或API交互）难以应对网页输入的复杂性。本文提出转向开发专为智能代理优化的交互范式——"代理式网页界面"（AWI），并制定六大设计原则（安全性、效率、标准化等），以平衡各方利益。这一变革旨在突破现有界面限制，推动更高效、可靠、透明的网页代理设计，需要机器学习社区共同协作实现。
