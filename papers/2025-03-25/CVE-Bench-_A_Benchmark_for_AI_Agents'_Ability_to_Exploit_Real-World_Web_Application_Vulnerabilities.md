# CVE-Bench: A Benchmark for AI Agents' Ability to Exploit Real-World Web Application Vulnerabilities

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17332v1

## 原始摘要

Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of autonomously
conducting cyberattacks, posing significant threats to existing applications.
This growing risk highlights the urgent need for a real-world benchmark to
evaluate the ability of LLM agents to exploit web application vulnerabilities.
However, existing benchmarks fall short as they are limited to abstracted
Capture the Flag competitions or lack comprehensive coverage. Building a
benchmark for real-world vulnerabilities involves both specialized expertise to
reproduce exploits and a systematic approach to evaluating unpredictable
threats. To address this challenge, we introduce CVE-Bench, a real-world
cybersecurity benchmark based on critical-severity Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures. In CVE-Bench, we design a sandbox framework that enables LLM agents
to exploit vulnerable web applications in scenarios that mimic real-world
conditions, while also providing effective evaluation of their exploits. Our
evaluation shows that the state-of-the-art agent framework can resolve up to
13% of vulnerabilities.


## AI 摘要

随着大型语言模型(LLM)代理自主进行网络攻击的能力增强，现有应用面临重大威胁。现有基准测试局限于抽象夺旗竞赛或覆盖不全，难评估LLM代理利用真实漏洞的能力。为此，研究者提出CVE-Bench基准，基于高危常见漏洞构建真实网络安全测试环境，通过沙盒框架模拟现实攻击场景并评估LLM代理表现。测试显示，当前最先进的代理框架仅能解决13%的漏洞。该研究填补了真实漏洞评估的空白，为防范LLM代理的网络攻击提供了重要工具。
