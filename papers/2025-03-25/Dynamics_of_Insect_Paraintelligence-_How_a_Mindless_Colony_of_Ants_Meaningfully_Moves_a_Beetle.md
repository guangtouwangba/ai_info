# Dynamics of Insect Paraintelligence: How a Mindless Colony of Ants Meaningfully Moves a Beetle

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18858v1

## 原始摘要

In this work, a new concept called Vector Dissipation of Randomness (VDR) is
developed and formalized. It describes the mechanism by which complex
multicomponent systems transition from chaos to order through the filtering of
random directions, accumulation of information in the environment, and
self-organization of agents. VDR explains how individual random strategies can
evolve into collective goaldirected behavior, leading to the emergence of an
ordered structure without centralized control. To test the proposed model, a
numerical simulation of the "ant and beetle" system was conducted, in which
agents (ants) randomly choose movement directions, but through feedback
mechanisms and filtering of weak strategies, they form a single coordinated
vector of the beetles movement. VDR is a universal mechanism applicable to a
wide range of self-organizing systems, including biological populations,
decentralized technological networks, sociological processes, and artificial
intelligence algorithms. For the first time, an equation of the normalized
emergence function in the processing of vector dissipation of randomness in the
Ant and Beetle system has been formulated. The concept of paraintelligence was
introduced for the first time. Insect paraintelligence is interpreted as a
rational functionality that is close to or equivalent to intelligent activity
in the absence of reflexive consciousness and selfawareness.


## AI 摘要

本文提出并形式化了一个新概念——随机性矢量耗散(VDR)，用于解释复杂多组分系统如何通过随机方向的过滤、环境信息积累和智能体自组织，从混沌过渡到有序。VDR阐明了分散个体如何通过随机策略演化为具有集体目标导向的行为，最终在无中心控制下形成有序结构。研究者通过"蚂蚁与甲虫"系统模拟验证该模型：蚂蚁随机移动，但通过反馈机制和弱策略过滤，最终形成甲虫运动的统一协调矢量。VDR是适用于生物种群、去中心化网络、社会过程和AI算法等自组织系统的通用机制。研究首次提出了标准化涌现函数方程，并引入"准智能"概念描述无自我意识的类智能功能。
