# Dynamics of Insect Paraintelligence: How a Mindless Colony of Ants Meaningfully Moves a Beetle

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18858v1

## 原始摘要

In this work, a new concept called Vector Dissipation of Randomness (VDR) is
developed and formalized. It describes the mechanism by which complex
multicomponent systems transition from chaos to order through the filtering of
random directions, accumulation of information in the environment, and
self-organization of agents. VDR explains how individual random strategies can
evolve into collective goaldirected behavior, leading to the emergence of an
ordered structure without centralized control. To test the proposed model, a
numerical simulation of the "ant and beetle" system was conducted, in which
agents (ants) randomly choose movement directions, but through feedback
mechanisms and filtering of weak strategies, they form a single coordinated
vector of the beetles movement. VDR is a universal mechanism applicable to a
wide range of self-organizing systems, including biological populations,
decentralized technological networks, sociological processes, and artificial
intelligence algorithms. For the first time, an equation of the normalized
emergence function in the processing of vector dissipation of randomness in the
Ant and Beetle system has been formulated. The concept of paraintelligence was
introduced for the first time. Insect paraintelligence is interpreted as a
rational functionality that is close to or equivalent to intelligent activity
in the absence of reflexive consciousness and selfawareness.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了"随机性矢量耗散"(VDR)的新概念，描述了多组分系统通过随机方向过滤、环境信息积累和智能体自组织从混沌到有序的转变机制。VDR解释了随机个体策略如何演化为集体目标导向行为，实现无需中心控制的有序结构。通过"蚂蚁与甲虫"系统的数值模拟验证：蚂蚁随机移动，但通过反馈机制和弱策略过滤，最终形成甲虫运动的协调矢量。VDR是适用于生物群体、去中心化网络、社会过程和AI算法的普适机制。研究首次提出了标准化涌现函数方程，并引入"准智能"概念，指无自我意识但功能等效智能的理性活动。
