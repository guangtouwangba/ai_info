# Dynamics of Insect Paraintelligence: How a Mindless Colony of Ants Meaningfully Moves a Beetle

## 原始摘要

In this work, a new concept called Vector Dissipation of Randomness (VDR) is
developed and formalized. It describes the mechanism by which complex
multicomponent systems transition from chaos to order through the filtering of
random directions, accumulation of information in the environment, and
self-organization of agents. VDR explains how individual random strategies can
evolve into collective goaldirected behavior, leading to the emergence of an
ordered structure without centralized control. To test the proposed model, a
numerical simulation of the "ant and beetle" system was conducted, in which
agents (ants) randomly choose movement directions, but through feedback
mechanisms and filtering of weak strategies, they form a single coordinated
vector of the beetles movement. VDR is a universal mechanism applicable to a
wide range of self-organizing systems, including biological populations,
decentralized technological networks, sociological processes, and artificial
intelligence algorithms. For the first time, an equation of the normalized
emergence function in the processing of vector dissipation of randomness in the
Ant and Beetle system has been formulated. The concept of paraintelligence was
introduced for the first time. Insect paraintelligence is interpreted as a
rational functionality that is close to or equivalent to intelligent activity
in the absence of reflexive consciousness and selfawareness.


## AI 摘要

本文提出"随机性矢量耗散"(VDR)新概念，阐释多组分系统通过随机方向过滤、环境信息积累和智能体自组织，实现从混沌到有序的转变机制。研究通过"蚂蚁与甲虫"系统模拟验证：蚂蚁随机移动经反馈机制和弱策略过滤，最终形成甲虫运动的协调矢量。VDR是普适性机制，适用于生物种群、去中心化网络、社会过程和AI算法等领域。首次提出标准化涌现函数方程，并引入"准智能"概念——指无反射意识状态下接近智能活动的理性功能。该研究为自组织系统演化提供了统一理论框架。
