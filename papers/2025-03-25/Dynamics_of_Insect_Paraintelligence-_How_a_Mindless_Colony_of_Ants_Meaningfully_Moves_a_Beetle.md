# Dynamics of Insect Paraintelligence: How a Mindless Colony of Ants Meaningfully Moves a Beetle

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18858v1

## 原始摘要

In this work, a new concept called Vector Dissipation of Randomness (VDR) is
developed and formalized. It describes the mechanism by which complex
multicomponent systems transition from chaos to order through the filtering of
random directions, accumulation of information in the environment, and
self-organization of agents. VDR explains how individual random strategies can
evolve into collective goaldirected behavior, leading to the emergence of an
ordered structure without centralized control. To test the proposed model, a
numerical simulation of the "ant and beetle" system was conducted, in which
agents (ants) randomly choose movement directions, but through feedback
mechanisms and filtering of weak strategies, they form a single coordinated
vector of the beetles movement. VDR is a universal mechanism applicable to a
wide range of self-organizing systems, including biological populations,
decentralized technological networks, sociological processes, and artificial
intelligence algorithms. For the first time, an equation of the normalized
emergence function in the processing of vector dissipation of randomness in the
Ant and Beetle system has been formulated. The concept of paraintelligence was
introduced for the first time. Insect paraintelligence is interpreted as a
rational functionality that is close to or equivalent to intelligent activity
in the absence of reflexive consciousness and selfawareness.


## AI 摘要

本文提出并形式化了"随机性矢量耗散"(VDR)新概念，揭示了多组分复杂系统通过随机方向过滤、环境信息积累和主体自组织从混沌向有序转变的机制。该理论阐释个体随机策略如何演化为集体目标导向行为，从而在无中心控制下形成有序结构。通过"蚂蚁与甲虫"系统数值模拟验证：蚂蚁随机移动经反馈机制和弱策略过滤，最终协调形成甲虫运动矢量。VDR是普适机制，适用于生物种群、去中心化技术网络、社会过程和AI算法等领域。研究首次提出标准化涌现函数方程，并引入"准智能"概念描述无自我意识却具有类智能功能的现象。
