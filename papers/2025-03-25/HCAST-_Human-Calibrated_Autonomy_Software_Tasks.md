# HCAST: Human-Calibrated Autonomy Software Tasks

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17354v1

## 原始摘要

To understand and predict the societal impacts of highly autonomous AI
systems, we need benchmarks with grounding, i.e., metrics that directly connect
AI performance to real-world effects we care about. We present HCAST
(Human-Calibrated Autonomy Software Tasks), a benchmark of 189 machine learning
engineering, cybersecurity, software engineering, and general reasoning tasks.
We collect 563 human baselines (totaling over 1500 hours) from people skilled
in these domains, working under identical conditions as AI agents, which lets
us estimate that HCAST tasks take humans between one minute and 8+ hours.
Measuring the time tasks take for humans provides an intuitive metric for
evaluating AI capabilities, helping answer the question "can an agent be
trusted to complete a task that would take a human X hours?" We evaluate the
success rates of AI agents built on frontier foundation models, and we find
that current agents succeed 70-80% of the time on tasks that take humans less
than one hour, and less than 20% of the time on tasks that take humans more
than 4 hours.


## AI 摘要

研究人员开发了HCAST基准测试，包含189项机器学习、网络安全、软件工程和逻辑推理任务，并收集了563名专业人士（总计1500+小时）的人类表现基线。该测试通过对比人类完成时间（1分钟至8+小时）来评估AI能力，为"AI能否完成人类需X小时的任务"提供直观指标。测试显示，当前基于前沿基础模型的AI代理在人类1小时内完成的任务上成功率70-80%，但在人类需4小时以上的任务上成功率不足20%。该基准通过将AI表现与现实影响关联，帮助预测高度自主AI的社会影响。
