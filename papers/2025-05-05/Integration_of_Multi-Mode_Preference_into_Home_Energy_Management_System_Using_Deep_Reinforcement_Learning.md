## 原始摘要

Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) have emerged as a pivotal tool in the
smart home ecosystem, aiming to enhance energy efficiency, reduce costs, and
improve user comfort. By enabling intelligent control and optimization of
household energy consumption, HEMS plays a significant role in bridging the gap
between consumer needs and energy utility objectives. However, much of the
existing literature construes consumer comfort as a mere deviation from the
standard appliance settings. Such deviations are typically incorporated into
optimization objectives via static weighting factors. These factors often
overlook the dynamic nature of consumer behaviors and preferences. Addressing
this oversight, our paper introduces a multi-mode Deep Reinforcement
Learning-based HEMS (DRL-HEMS) framework, meticulously designed to optimize
based on dynamic, consumer-defined preferences. Our primary goal is to augment
consumer involvement in Demand Response (DR) programs by embedding dynamic
multi-mode preferences tailored to individual appliances. In this study, we
leverage a model-free, single-agent DRL algorithm to deliver a HEMS framework
that is not only dynamic but also user-friendly. To validate its efficacy, we
employed real-world data at 15-minute intervals, including metrics such as
electricity price, ambient temperature, and appliances' power consumption. Our
results show that the model performs exceptionally well in optimizing energy
consumption within different preference modes. Furthermore, when compared to
traditional algorithms based on Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), our
model achieves nearly optimal performance while outperforming in computational
efficiency.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种基于深度强化学习(DRL)的智能家庭能源管理系统(HEMS)框架，通过动态多模式偏好优化家庭能源使用。与现有使用静态权重因子的方法不同，该框架能更好地适应消费者行为偏好的动态变化。研究采用无模型单智能体DRL算法，利用15分钟间隔的真实数据（电价、环境温度、电器功耗）进行验证。结果显示，该模型在不同偏好模式下均能出色优化能耗，计算效率优于传统的混合整数线性规划(MILP)方法，同时保持近乎最优的性能，有效提升了用户在需求响应(DR)计划中的参与度。
