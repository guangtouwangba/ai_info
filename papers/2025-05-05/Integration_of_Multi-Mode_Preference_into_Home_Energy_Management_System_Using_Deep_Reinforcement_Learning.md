## 原始摘要

Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) have emerged as a pivotal tool in the
smart home ecosystem, aiming to enhance energy efficiency, reduce costs, and
improve user comfort. By enabling intelligent control and optimization of
household energy consumption, HEMS plays a significant role in bridging the gap
between consumer needs and energy utility objectives. However, much of the
existing literature construes consumer comfort as a mere deviation from the
standard appliance settings. Such deviations are typically incorporated into
optimization objectives via static weighting factors. These factors often
overlook the dynamic nature of consumer behaviors and preferences. Addressing
this oversight, our paper introduces a multi-mode Deep Reinforcement
Learning-based HEMS (DRL-HEMS) framework, meticulously designed to optimize
based on dynamic, consumer-defined preferences. Our primary goal is to augment
consumer involvement in Demand Response (DR) programs by embedding dynamic
multi-mode preferences tailored to individual appliances. In this study, we
leverage a model-free, single-agent DRL algorithm to deliver a HEMS framework
that is not only dynamic but also user-friendly. To validate its efficacy, we
employed real-world data at 15-minute intervals, including metrics such as
electricity price, ambient temperature, and appliances' power consumption. Our
results show that the model performs exceptionally well in optimizing energy
consumption within different preference modes. Furthermore, when compared to
traditional algorithms based on Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), our
model achieves nearly optimal performance while outperforming in computational
efficiency.
