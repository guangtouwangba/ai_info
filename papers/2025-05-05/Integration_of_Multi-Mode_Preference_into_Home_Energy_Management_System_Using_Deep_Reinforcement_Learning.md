## 原始摘要

Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) have emerged as a pivotal tool in the
smart home ecosystem, aiming to enhance energy efficiency, reduce costs, and
improve user comfort. By enabling intelligent control and optimization of
household energy consumption, HEMS plays a significant role in bridging the gap
between consumer needs and energy utility objectives. However, much of the
existing literature construes consumer comfort as a mere deviation from the
standard appliance settings. Such deviations are typically incorporated into
optimization objectives via static weighting factors. These factors often
overlook the dynamic nature of consumer behaviors and preferences. Addressing
this oversight, our paper introduces a multi-mode Deep Reinforcement
Learning-based HEMS (DRL-HEMS) framework, meticulously designed to optimize
based on dynamic, consumer-defined preferences. Our primary goal is to augment
consumer involvement in Demand Response (DR) programs by embedding dynamic
multi-mode preferences tailored to individual appliances. In this study, we
leverage a model-free, single-agent DRL algorithm to deliver a HEMS framework
that is not only dynamic but also user-friendly. To validate its efficacy, we
employed real-world data at 15-minute intervals, including metrics such as
electricity price, ambient temperature, and appliances' power consumption. Our
results show that the model performs exceptionally well in optimizing energy
consumption within different preference modes. Furthermore, when compared to
traditional algorithms based on Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), our
model achieves nearly optimal performance while outperforming in computational
efficiency.


## AI 摘要

家庭能源管理系统（HEMS）是智能家居生态中的关键工具，旨在提升能效、降低成本并优化用户舒适度。传统研究常将用户舒适度简单视为设备设置的静态偏差，而本文提出了一种基于深度强化学习（DRL）的多模式HEMS框架（DRL-HEMS），通过动态学习用户偏好实现优化。该模型采用无模型单智能体DRL算法，结合电价、环境温度和电器功耗等实时数据，显著提升了需求响应（DR）中的用户参与度。实验表明，相比传统混合整数线性规划（MILP）算法，该框架在保持近最优性能的同时，计算效率更高。
