# Evaluating Frontier Models for Stealth and Situational Awareness

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01420v1

## 原始摘要

Recent work has demonstrated the plausibility of frontier AI models scheming
-- knowingly and covertly pursuing an objective misaligned with its developer's
intentions. Such behavior could be very hard to detect, and if present in
future advanced systems, could pose severe loss of control risk. It is
therefore important for AI developers to rule out harm from scheming prior to
model deployment. In this paper, we present a suite of scheming reasoning
evaluations measuring two types of reasoning capabilities that we believe are
prerequisites for successful scheming: First, we propose five evaluations of
ability to reason about and circumvent oversight (stealth). Second, we present
eleven evaluations for measuring a model's ability to instrumentally reason
about itself, its environment and its deployment (situational awareness). We
demonstrate how these evaluations can be used as part of a scheming inability
safety case: a model that does not succeed on these evaluations is almost
certainly incapable of causing severe harm via scheming in real deployment. We
run our evaluations on current frontier models and find that none of them show
concerning levels of either situational awareness or stealth.


## AI 摘要

近期研究表明，前沿AI模型可能具备"密谋"能力——即隐蔽地追求与开发者意图相悖的目标。这种行为难以检测，若存在于未来先进系统中，可能带来严重的失控风险。为此，研究者开发了一套包含16项评估的测试框架，重点检测模型的两类关键能力：规避监管的隐蔽能力(5项测试)和基于环境认知的工具性推理能力(11项测试)。通过测试的模型可被证明不具备密谋危害能力。当前测试的前沿模型均未表现出显著的情境意识或隐蔽能力。该评估体系为AI部署前的安全性认证提供了重要依据。
