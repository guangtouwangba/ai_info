# The Dance of the Sheared Eigenfunctions

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01303v1

## 原始摘要

In this work, we delve into the theory of sheared potentials in
non-relativistic quantum mechanics. After defining what we mean by a family of
sheared potentials, we consider these families in two particular but emblematic
cases, the harmonic oscillator and the symmetric potential well proportional to
$|x|$. In both cases, besides determining the spectra, we analyse the impact of
the shearing process on the respective eigenfunctions. The latter analysis is
typically left aside in the literature, but here we show that the sheared
eigenfunctions yield insights that allow for a deeper understanding of the main
features exhibited by the spectra. Finally, we make a few comments about the
connection between the change in the spectra of a given sheared family and the
necessary work that must be made by an external agent to implement such a
change.


## AI 摘要

本研究探讨了非相对论量子力学中的剪切势理论，重点分析了两种典型势场（谐振子势和对称|x|势阱）在剪切变换下的能谱及本征函数变化。研究发现，剪切过程不仅改变了系统的能谱结构，其对本征函数的影响也为理解能谱特征提供了新视角，这一方面常被现有文献忽视。此外，研究还讨论了能谱变化与外部作用所需做功之间的关联。通过系统分析剪切势族，该工作深化了对势场几何变形与量子系统响应关系的理解。
