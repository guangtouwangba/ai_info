# The Dance of the Sheared Eigenfunctions

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01303v1

## 原始摘要

In this work, we delve into the theory of sheared potentials in
non-relativistic quantum mechanics. After defining what we mean by a family of
sheared potentials, we consider these families in two particular but emblematic
cases, the harmonic oscillator and the symmetric potential well proportional to
$|x|$. In both cases, besides determining the spectra, we analyse the impact of
the shearing process on the respective eigenfunctions. The latter analysis is
typically left aside in the literature, but here we show that the sheared
eigenfunctions yield insights that allow for a deeper understanding of the main
features exhibited by the spectra. Finally, we make a few comments about the
connection between the change in the spectra of a given sheared family and the
necessary work that must be made by an external agent to implement such a
change.


## AI 摘要

本文研究了非相对论量子力学中的剪切势理论，重点分析了两种典型情况：谐振子势和对称势阱|x|。研究不仅确定了能谱，还深入探讨了剪切过程对本征函数的影响，揭示了本征函数特征与能谱特性的内在联系。此外，文章还讨论了能谱变化与外力做功之间的关系。该研究填补了文献中对剪切本征函数分析的空白，为理解剪切势系统的量子行为提供了新视角。
