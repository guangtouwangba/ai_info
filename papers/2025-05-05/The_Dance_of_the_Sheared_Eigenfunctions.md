# The Dance of the Sheared Eigenfunctions

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01303v1

## 原始摘要

In this work, we delve into the theory of sheared potentials in
non-relativistic quantum mechanics. After defining what we mean by a family of
sheared potentials, we consider these families in two particular but emblematic
cases, the harmonic oscillator and the symmetric potential well proportional to
$|x|$. In both cases, besides determining the spectra, we analyse the impact of
the shearing process on the respective eigenfunctions. The latter analysis is
typically left aside in the literature, but here we show that the sheared
eigenfunctions yield insights that allow for a deeper understanding of the main
features exhibited by the spectra. Finally, we make a few comments about the
connection between the change in the spectra of a given sheared family and the
necessary work that must be made by an external agent to implement such a
change.


## AI 摘要

本研究探讨了非相对论量子力学中的剪切势理论，重点分析了两种典型势场（谐振子势和|x|对称势阱）的剪切族。研究不仅确定了能谱，还深入考察了剪切过程对本征函数的影响，揭示了本征函数特征与能谱主要特性之间的深刻联系。此外，作者还讨论了能谱变化与实现这种变化所需外力做功之间的关系。该工作弥补了文献中常被忽略的本征函数分析，为理解剪切势的物理特性提供了新视角。（99字）
