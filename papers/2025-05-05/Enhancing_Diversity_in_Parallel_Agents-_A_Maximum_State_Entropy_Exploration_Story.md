# Enhancing Diversity in Parallel Agents: A Maximum State Entropy Exploration Story

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01336v1

## 原始摘要

Parallel data collection has redefined Reinforcement Learning (RL), unlocking
unprecedented efficiency and powering breakthroughs in large-scale real-world
applications. In this paradigm, $N$ identical agents operate in $N$ replicas of
an environment simulator, accelerating data collection by a factor of $N$. A
critical question arises: \textit{Does specializing the policies of the
parallel agents hold the key to surpass the $N$ factor acceleration?} In this
paper, we introduce a novel learning framework that maximizes the entropy of
collected data in a parallel setting. Our approach carefully balances the
entropy of individual agents with inter-agent diversity, effectively minimizing
redundancies. The latter idea is implemented with a centralized policy gradient
method, which shows promise when evaluated empirically against systems of
identical agents, as well as synergy with batch RL techniques that can exploit
data diversity. Finally, we provide an original concentration analysis that
shows faster rates for specialized parallel sampling distributions, which
supports our methodology and may be of independent interest.
