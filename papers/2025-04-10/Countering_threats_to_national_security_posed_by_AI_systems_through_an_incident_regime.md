# Countering threats to national security posed by AI systems through an incident regime

## 原始摘要

Recent progress in AI capabilities has heightened concerns that AI systems
could pose a threat to national security, for example, by making it easier for
malicious actors to perform cyberattacks on critical national infrastructure,
or through loss of control of autonomous AI systems. In parallel, federal
legislators in the US have proposed nascent 'AI incident regimes' to identify
and counter similar threats. In this paper, we consolidate these two trends and
present a proposal for a legally mandated post-deployment AI incident regime
that aims to counter potential national security threats from AI systems. We
start the paper by introducing the concept of 'security-critical' to describe
doctors that pose extreme risks to national security, before arguing that
'security-critical' describes civilian nuclear power, aviation, life science
dual-use research of concern, and frontier AI development. We then present in
detail our AI incident regime proposal, justifying each component of the
proposal by demonstrating its similarity to US domestic incident regimes in
other 'security-critical' sectors. Finally, we sketch a hypothetical scenario
where our proposed AI incident regime deals with an AI cyber incident. Our
proposed AI incident regime is split into three phases. The first phase
revolves around a novel operationalization of what counts as an 'AI incident'
and we suggest that AI providers must create a 'national security case' before
deploying a frontier AI system. The second and third phases spell out that AI
providers should notify a government agency about incidents, and that the
government agency should be involved in amending AI providers' security and
safety procedures, in order to counter future threats to national security.


## AI 摘要

本文提出建立强制性的AI事故应对机制以应对国家安全威胁。作者将"安全关键领域"概念扩展到民用核能、航空、生命科学和前沿AI开发等领域，建议AI系统部署前需提交"国家安全案例"。该机制分为三阶段：1)明确AI事故定义；2)要求AI供应商向政府机构报告事故；3)政府参与修订安全规程以预防未来威胁。研究通过类比美国其他安全关键领域的现有机制，论证了该提案的合理性，并以AI网络事件为例展示了机制运作方式，旨在通过法律手段降低AI系统对国家安全构成的潜在风险。
