# Countering threats to national security posed by AI systems through an incident regime

## 原始摘要

Recent progress in AI capabilities has heightened concerns that AI systems
could pose a threat to national security, for example, by making it easier for
malicious actors to perform cyberattacks on critical national infrastructure,
or through loss of control of autonomous AI systems. In parallel, federal
legislators in the US have proposed nascent 'AI incident regimes' to identify
and counter similar threats. In this paper, we consolidate these two trends and
present a proposal for a legally mandated post-deployment AI incident regime
that aims to counter potential national security threats from AI systems. We
start the paper by introducing the concept of 'security-critical' to describe
doctors that pose extreme risks to national security, before arguing that
'security-critical' describes civilian nuclear power, aviation, life science
dual-use research of concern, and frontier AI development. We then present in
detail our AI incident regime proposal, justifying each component of the
proposal by demonstrating its similarity to US domestic incident regimes in
other 'security-critical' sectors. Finally, we sketch a hypothetical scenario
where our proposed AI incident regime deals with an AI cyber incident. Our
proposed AI incident regime is split into three phases. The first phase
revolves around a novel operationalization of what counts as an 'AI incident'
and we suggest that AI providers must create a 'national security case' before
deploying a frontier AI system. The second and third phases spell out that AI
providers should notify a government agency about incidents, and that the
government agency should be involved in amending AI providers' security and
safety procedures, in order to counter future threats to national security.


## AI 摘要

本文提出建立针对AI系统的强制性"AI事故响应机制"以应对国家安全威胁。研究将核能、航空等高风险领域定义为"安全关键"行业，认为前沿AI开发也应归入此类。该机制分为三阶段：1)要求AI提供商在部署前沿系统前提交"国家安全案例"；2)发生事故时需向政府报告；3)政府参与修订安全规程以防范未来威胁。作者通过与其他安全关键行业的现有机制对比论证方案合理性，并模拟了该机制处理AI网络攻击的案例。该提案旨在通过法律强制手段管控AI可能引发的国家安全风险。
