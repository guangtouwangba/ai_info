# Countering threats to national security posed by AI systems through an incident regime

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19887v2

## 原始摘要

Recent progress in AI capabilities has heightened concerns that AI systems
could pose a threat to national security, for example, by making it easier for
malicious actors to perform cyberattacks on critical national infrastructure,
or through loss of control of autonomous AI systems. In parallel, federal
legislators in the US have proposed nascent 'AI incident regimes' to identify
and counter similar threats. In this paper, we consolidate these two trends and
present a proposal for a legally mandated post-deployment AI incident regime
that aims to counter potential national security threats from AI systems. We
start the paper by introducing the concept of 'security-critical' to describe
doctors that pose extreme risks to national security, before arguing that
'security-critical' describes civilian nuclear power, aviation, life science
dual-use research of concern, and frontier AI development. We then present in
detail our AI incident regime proposal, justifying each component of the
proposal by demonstrating its similarity to US domestic incident regimes in
other 'security-critical' sectors. Finally, we sketch a hypothetical scenario
where our proposed AI incident regime deals with an AI cyber incident. Our
proposed AI incident regime is split into three phases. The first phase
revolves around a novel operationalization of what counts as an 'AI incident'
and we suggest that AI providers must create a 'national security case' before
deploying a frontier AI system. The second and third phases spell out that AI
providers should notify a government agency about incidents, and that the
government agency should be involved in amending AI providers' security and
safety procedures, in order to counter future threats to national security.


## AI 摘要

近期AI能力的快速发展引发了对国家安全威胁的担忧，如恶意网络攻击或自主AI系统失控。为此，美国立法者提出建立"AI事件管理机制"应对这些风险。本文提出一个法定的事后部署AI事件管理方案，将AI与核能、航空等"安全关键"领域并列，要求AI提供商在部署前沿系统前提交"国家安全案例"，并在事故发生时向政府报告。方案分为三阶段：界定AI事件标准、强制事故报告制度、政府参与修正安全措施。最后通过模拟网络攻击案例展示了该机制的实际应用价值。
