# Countering threats to national security posed by AI systems through an incident regime

## 原始摘要

Recent progress in AI capabilities has heightened concerns that AI systems
could pose a threat to national security, for example, by making it easier for
malicious actors to perform cyberattacks on critical national infrastructure,
or through loss of control of autonomous AI systems. In parallel, federal
legislators in the US have proposed nascent 'AI incident regimes' to identify
and counter similar threats. In this paper, we consolidate these two trends and
present a proposal for a legally mandated post-deployment AI incident regime
that aims to counter potential national security threats from AI systems. We
start the paper by introducing the concept of 'security-critical' to describe
doctors that pose extreme risks to national security, before arguing that
'security-critical' describes civilian nuclear power, aviation, life science
dual-use research of concern, and frontier AI development. We then present in
detail our AI incident regime proposal, justifying each component of the
proposal by demonstrating its similarity to US domestic incident regimes in
other 'security-critical' sectors. Finally, we sketch a hypothetical scenario
where our proposed AI incident regime deals with an AI cyber incident. Our
proposed AI incident regime is split into three phases. The first phase
revolves around a novel operationalization of what counts as an 'AI incident'
and we suggest that AI providers must create a 'national security case' before
deploying a frontier AI system. The second and third phases spell out that AI
providers should notify a government agency about incidents, and that the
government agency should be involved in amending AI providers' security and
safety procedures, in order to counter future threats to national security.


## AI 摘要

近期AI技术的快速发展引发了对国家安全威胁的担忧，如网络攻击关键基础设施或失控的自主AI系统。为此，美国立法者提出建立"AI事件管理机制"来应对此类风险。本文建议设立法律强制的AI部署后事件管理机制，将可能威胁国家安全的领域定义为"安全关键领域"(如核电、航空、生物双用途研究和前沿AI开发)。提案分为三阶段：(1)AI供应商部署前沿系统前需创建"国家安全案例"；(2)发生事件时需向政府报告；(3)政府参与修正供应商的安全规程。最后通过模拟网络事件案例说明该机制运作方式。
