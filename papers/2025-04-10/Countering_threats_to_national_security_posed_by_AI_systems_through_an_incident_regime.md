# Countering threats to national security posed by AI systems through an incident regime

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19887v2

## 原始摘要

Recent progress in AI capabilities has heightened concerns that AI systems
could pose a threat to national security, for example, by making it easier for
malicious actors to perform cyberattacks on critical national infrastructure,
or through loss of control of autonomous AI systems. In parallel, federal
legislators in the US have proposed nascent 'AI incident regimes' to identify
and counter similar threats. In this paper, we consolidate these two trends and
present a proposal for a legally mandated post-deployment AI incident regime
that aims to counter potential national security threats from AI systems. We
start the paper by introducing the concept of 'security-critical' to describe
doctors that pose extreme risks to national security, before arguing that
'security-critical' describes civilian nuclear power, aviation, life science
dual-use research of concern, and frontier AI development. We then present in
detail our AI incident regime proposal, justifying each component of the
proposal by demonstrating its similarity to US domestic incident regimes in
other 'security-critical' sectors. Finally, we sketch a hypothetical scenario
where our proposed AI incident regime deals with an AI cyber incident. Our
proposed AI incident regime is split into three phases. The first phase
revolves around a novel operationalization of what counts as an 'AI incident'
and we suggest that AI providers must create a 'national security case' before
deploying a frontier AI system. The second and third phases spell out that AI
providers should notify a government agency about incidents, and that the
government agency should be involved in amending AI providers' security and
safety procedures, in order to counter future threats to national security.


## AI 摘要

近期AI能力的快速发展引发了国家安全担忧，如恶意网络攻击关键基础设施或自主AI系统失控的风险。为此，本文提出建立法律强制的"AI事件管理机制"以应对威胁。首先界定"安全关键"领域（如核能、航空、生物双用途研究及前沿AI），然后设计三阶段机制：1)部署前沿AI前需提交"国家安全论证"并明确AI事件定义；2)发生事件时AI提供商须向政府报告；3)政府参与修订安全规程以防范未来风险。该机制借鉴了美国其他安全关键行业的事件管理经验，并通过模拟网络攻击场景验证其可行性。
