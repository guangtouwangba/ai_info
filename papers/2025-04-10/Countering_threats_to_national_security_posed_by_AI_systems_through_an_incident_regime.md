# Countering threats to national security posed by AI systems through an incident regime

## 原始摘要

Recent progress in AI capabilities has heightened concerns that AI systems
could pose a threat to national security, for example, by making it easier for
malicious actors to perform cyberattacks on critical national infrastructure,
or through loss of control of autonomous AI systems. In parallel, federal
legislators in the US have proposed nascent 'AI incident regimes' to identify
and counter similar threats. In this paper, we consolidate these two trends and
present a proposal for a legally mandated post-deployment AI incident regime
that aims to counter potential national security threats from AI systems. We
start the paper by introducing the concept of 'security-critical' to describe
doctors that pose extreme risks to national security, before arguing that
'security-critical' describes civilian nuclear power, aviation, life science
dual-use research of concern, and frontier AI development. We then present in
detail our AI incident regime proposal, justifying each component of the
proposal by demonstrating its similarity to US domestic incident regimes in
other 'security-critical' sectors. Finally, we sketch a hypothetical scenario
where our proposed AI incident regime deals with an AI cyber incident. Our
proposed AI incident regime is split into three phases. The first phase
revolves around a novel operationalization of what counts as an 'AI incident'
and we suggest that AI providers must create a 'national security case' before
deploying a frontier AI system. The second and third phases spell out that AI
providers should notify a government agency about incidents, and that the
government agency should be involved in amending AI providers' security and
safety procedures, in order to counter future threats to national security.


## AI 摘要

随着AI能力的快速进步，其潜在国家安全风险引发担忧，如网络攻击关键基础设施或失控的自主AI系统。为此，美国立法者提出建立"AI事件应对机制"。本文提出一项法定部署后AI事件监管方案，将"安全关键"概念(适用于核能、航空等领域)延伸至前沿AI系统。该机制分三阶段：1)部署前需提交"国家安全论证"；2)事件发生后强制上报政府机构；3)政府参与修正AI供应商的安全协议。研究通过类比其他安全关键行业的现有机制，论证了该方案的合理性，并以假设性网络事件为例说明运作流程。
