# Countering threats to national security posed by AI systems through an incident regime

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19887v2

## 原始摘要

Recent progress in AI capabilities has heightened concerns that AI systems
could pose a threat to national security, for example, by making it easier for
malicious actors to perform cyberattacks on critical national infrastructure,
or through loss of control of autonomous AI systems. In parallel, federal
legislators in the US have proposed nascent 'AI incident regimes' to identify
and counter similar threats. In this paper, we consolidate these two trends and
present a proposal for a legally mandated post-deployment AI incident regime
that aims to counter potential national security threats from AI systems. We
start the paper by introducing the concept of 'security-critical' to describe
doctors that pose extreme risks to national security, before arguing that
'security-critical' describes civilian nuclear power, aviation, life science
dual-use research of concern, and frontier AI development. We then present in
detail our AI incident regime proposal, justifying each component of the
proposal by demonstrating its similarity to US domestic incident regimes in
other 'security-critical' sectors. Finally, we sketch a hypothetical scenario
where our proposed AI incident regime deals with an AI cyber incident. Our
proposed AI incident regime is split into three phases. The first phase
revolves around a novel operationalization of what counts as an 'AI incident'
and we suggest that AI providers must create a 'national security case' before
deploying a frontier AI system. The second and third phases spell out that AI
providers should notify a government agency about incidents, and that the
government agency should be involved in amending AI providers' security and
safety procedures, in order to counter future threats to national security.


## AI 摘要

近期AI能力的快速发展引发了对国家安全的担忧，如恶意网络攻击和自主AI失控的风险。为此，美国立法者提出建立"AI事件管理机制"来应对这些威胁。本文建议将AI系统部署后纳入法定监管，重点关注"安全关键"领域（如核能、航空、生物双用途研究和前沿AI）。提案分为三阶段：1)部署前沿AI前需提交"国家安全案例"；2)AI提供商须报告事件；3)政府机构参与修订安全规程。该机制借鉴了其他关键行业的监管经验，并通过模拟网络事件场景验证其可行性，旨在预防AI对国家安全的潜在威胁。(100字)
