# Evaluating Retrieval Augmented Generative Models for Document Queries in Transportation Safety

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07022v1

## 原始摘要

Applications of generative Large Language Models LLMs are rapidly expanding
across various domains, promising significant improvements in workflow
efficiency and information retrieval. However, their implementation in
specialized, high-stakes domains such as hazardous materials transportation is
challenging due to accuracy and reliability concerns. This study evaluates the
performance of three fine-tuned generative models, ChatGPT, Google's Vertex AI,
and ORNL Retrieval Augmented Generation augmented LLaMA 2 and LLaMA in
retrieving regulatory information essential for hazardous material
transportation compliance in the United States. Utilizing approximately 40
publicly available federal and state regulatory documents, we developed 100
realistic queries relevant to route planning and permitting requirements.
Responses were qualitatively rated based on accuracy, detail, and relevance,
complemented by quantitative assessments of semantic similarity between model
outputs. Results demonstrated that the RAG-augmented LLaMA models significantly
outperformed Vertex AI and ChatGPT, providing more detailed and generally
accurate information, despite occasional inconsistencies. This research
introduces the first known application of RAG in transportation safety,
emphasizing the need for domain-specific fine-tuning and rigorous evaluation
methodologies to ensure reliability and minimize the risk of inaccuracies in
high-stakes environments.


## AI 摘要

本研究评估了ChatGPT、谷歌Vertex AI和ORNL检索增强生成（RAG）优化的LLaMA 2/LLaMA模型在美国危险品运输法规检索中的表现。基于约40份联邦/州法规文件和100个实际查询测试发现，RAG增强的LLaMA模型在准确性、细节和相关性上显著优于其他模型，尽管偶有不一致。该研究首次将RAG技术应用于运输安全领域，强调专业领域需进行模型微调和严格评估，以确保高风险环境下的可靠性。研究为生成式大模型在专业领域的应用提供了重要参考。
