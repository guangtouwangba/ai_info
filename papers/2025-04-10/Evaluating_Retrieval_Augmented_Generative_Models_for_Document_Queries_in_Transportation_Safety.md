# Evaluating Retrieval Augmented Generative Models for Document Queries in Transportation Safety

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07022v1

## 原始摘要

Applications of generative Large Language Models LLMs are rapidly expanding
across various domains, promising significant improvements in workflow
efficiency and information retrieval. However, their implementation in
specialized, high-stakes domains such as hazardous materials transportation is
challenging due to accuracy and reliability concerns. This study evaluates the
performance of three fine-tuned generative models, ChatGPT, Google's Vertex AI,
and ORNL Retrieval Augmented Generation augmented LLaMA 2 and LLaMA in
retrieving regulatory information essential for hazardous material
transportation compliance in the United States. Utilizing approximately 40
publicly available federal and state regulatory documents, we developed 100
realistic queries relevant to route planning and permitting requirements.
Responses were qualitatively rated based on accuracy, detail, and relevance,
complemented by quantitative assessments of semantic similarity between model
outputs. Results demonstrated that the RAG-augmented LLaMA models significantly
outperformed Vertex AI and ChatGPT, providing more detailed and generally
accurate information, despite occasional inconsistencies. This research
introduces the first known application of RAG in transportation safety,
emphasizing the need for domain-specific fine-tuning and rigorous evaluation
methodologies to ensure reliability and minimize the risk of inaccuracies in
high-stakes environments.


## AI 摘要

本研究评估了ChatGPT、谷歌Vertex AI和ORNL检索增强生成（RAG）优化的LLaMA模型在美国危险品运输法规检索中的表现。基于约40份联邦和州法规文件生成的100个查询测试显示，RAG增强的LLaMA模型在准确性、细节和相关性上显著优于其他模型，尽管偶有不一致。这是RAG技术在运输安全领域的首次应用，研究表明在专业高风险领域需进行针对性优化和严格评估，以确保可靠性并减少错误风险。研究为专业领域大语言模型的应用提供了重要参考。
