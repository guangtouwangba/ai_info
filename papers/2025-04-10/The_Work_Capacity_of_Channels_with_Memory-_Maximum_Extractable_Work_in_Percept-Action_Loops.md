# The Work Capacity of Channels with Memory: Maximum Extractable Work in Percept-Action Loops

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06209v1

## 原始摘要

Predicting future observations plays a central role in machine learning,
biology, economics, and many other fields. It lies at the heart of
organizational principles such as the variational free energy principle and has
even been shown -- based on the second law of thermodynamics -- to be necessary
for reaching the fundamental energetic limits of sequential information
processing. While the usefulness of the predictive paradigm is undisputed,
complex adaptive systems that interact with their environment are more than
just predictive machines: they have the power to act upon their environment and
cause change. In this work, we develop a framework to analyze the
thermodynamics of information processing in percept-action loops -- a model of
agent-environment interaction -- allowing us to investigate the thermodynamic
implications of actions and percepts on equal footing. To this end, we
introduce the concept of work capacity -- the maximum rate at which an agent
can expect to extract work from its environment. Our results reveal that
neither of two previously established design principles for work-efficient
agents -- maximizing predictive power and forgetting past actions -- remains
optimal in environments where actions have observable consequences. Instead, a
trade-off emerges: work-efficient agents must balance prediction and
forgetting, as remembering past actions can reduce the available free energy.
This highlights a fundamental departure from the thermodynamics of passive
observation, suggesting that prediction and energy efficiency may be at odds in
active learning systems.


## AI 摘要

这篇研究探讨了主动学习系统中信息处理的热力学原理。传统观点认为预测能力是机器学习和生物系统高效运作的核心，但研究发现，在与环境互动的主动系统中，仅优化预测并不总能实现最佳能量效率。作者提出了"工作容量"概念来衡量系统从环境中提取功的最大速率，发现当系统行为会影响环境时，过去被推崇的两大设计原则——最大化预测能力和遗忘过去行为——都不再最优。相反，高效系统需要在预测和遗忘之间取得平衡，因为记住过去行为可能减少可用自由能，这表明主动学习系统中预测与能效可能存在矛盾。
