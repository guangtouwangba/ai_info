# Dolphin: Moving Towards Closed-loop Auto-research through Thinking, Practice, and Feedback

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03916v3

## 原始摘要

The scientific research paradigm is undergoing a profound transformation
owing to the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Recent works
demonstrate that various AI-assisted research methods can largely improve
research efficiency by improving data analysis, accelerating computation, and
fostering novel idea generation. To further move towards the ultimate goal
(i.e., automatic scientific research), in this paper, we introduce Dolphin, a
closed-loop LLM-driven framework to enhance the automation level of scientific
research. Dolphin first generates novel ideas based on feedback from previous
experiments and relevant papers ranked by the topic and task attributes. Then,
the generated ideas can be implemented using a code template refined and
debugged with the designed exception-traceback-guided local code structure.
Finally, Dolphin automatically analyzes the results of each idea and feeds the
results back to the next round of idea generation. Experiments are conducted on
the benchmark datasets of different topics and a subset of MLE-bench. Results
show that Dolphin can continuously improve the performance of the input topic
in a loop. We highlight that Dolphin can automatically propose methods that are
comparable to the state-of-the-art in some tasks such as 3D point
classification.


## AI 摘要

人工智能正在深刻改变科研范式。本文提出Dolphin框架，这是一个由大语言模型驱动的闭环系统，旨在提升科研自动化水平。Dolphin能根据先前实验结果和相关论文反馈生成新想法，通过代码模板实现并调试，自动分析结果并反馈给下一轮创新。实验表明，Dolphin能在循环中持续提升输入课题的性能，在某些任务(如3D点分类)中提出的方法甚至媲美最先进技术。该框架通过改进数据分析、加速计算和促进创新，显著提高了科研效率，向自动化科研的终极目标迈进了一步。
