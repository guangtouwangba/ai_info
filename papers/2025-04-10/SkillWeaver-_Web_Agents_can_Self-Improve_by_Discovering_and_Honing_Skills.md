# SkillWeaver: Web Agents can Self-Improve by Discovering and Honing Skills

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07079v1

## 原始摘要

To survive and thrive in complex environments, humans have evolved
sophisticated self-improvement mechanisms through environment exploration,
hierarchical abstraction of experiences into reuseable skills, and
collaborative construction of an ever-growing skill repertoire. Despite recent
advancements, autonomous web agents still lack crucial self-improvement
capabilities, struggling with procedural knowledge abstraction, refining
skills, and skill composition. In this work, we introduce SkillWeaver, a
skill-centric framework enabling agents to self-improve by autonomously
synthesizing reusable skills as APIs. Given a new website, the agent
autonomously discovers skills, executes them for practice, and distills
practice experiences into robust APIs. Iterative exploration continually
expands a library of lightweight, plug-and-play APIs, significantly enhancing
the agent's capabilities. Experiments on WebArena and real-world websites
demonstrate the efficacy of SkillWeaver, achieving relative success rate
improvements of 31.8% and 39.8%, respectively. Additionally, APIs synthesized
by strong agents substantially enhance weaker agents through transferable
skills, yielding improvements of up to 54.3% on WebArena. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of honing diverse website interactions into APIs,
which can be seamlessly shared among various web agents.


## AI 摘要

人类通过环境探索、经验抽象和技能协作构建了复杂的自我提升机制，但现有网络代理仍缺乏关键的自改进能力。为此，研究者提出了SkillWeaver框架，使代理能自主合成可重用的API技能：在新网站上发现技能、通过练习提炼为稳健API，并持续扩展轻量级API库。实验显示，SkillWeaver在WebArena和真实网站上的成功率分别提升31.8%和39.8%，且强代理合成的API可使弱代理性能提升达54.3%。该框架有效将网站交互提炼为可共享API，显著增强了代理能力。
