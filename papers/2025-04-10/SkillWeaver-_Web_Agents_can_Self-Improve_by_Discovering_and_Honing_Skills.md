# SkillWeaver: Web Agents can Self-Improve by Discovering and Honing Skills

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07079v1

## 原始摘要

To survive and thrive in complex environments, humans have evolved
sophisticated self-improvement mechanisms through environment exploration,
hierarchical abstraction of experiences into reuseable skills, and
collaborative construction of an ever-growing skill repertoire. Despite recent
advancements, autonomous web agents still lack crucial self-improvement
capabilities, struggling with procedural knowledge abstraction, refining
skills, and skill composition. In this work, we introduce SkillWeaver, a
skill-centric framework enabling agents to self-improve by autonomously
synthesizing reusable skills as APIs. Given a new website, the agent
autonomously discovers skills, executes them for practice, and distills
practice experiences into robust APIs. Iterative exploration continually
expands a library of lightweight, plug-and-play APIs, significantly enhancing
the agent's capabilities. Experiments on WebArena and real-world websites
demonstrate the efficacy of SkillWeaver, achieving relative success rate
improvements of 31.8% and 39.8%, respectively. Additionally, APIs synthesized
by strong agents substantially enhance weaker agents through transferable
skills, yielding improvements of up to 54.3% on WebArena. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of honing diverse website interactions into APIs,
which can be seamlessly shared among various web agents.


## AI 摘要

人类通过环境探索、经验分层抽象和协作构建技能库实现自我提升。当前自主网络代理缺乏这种能力，难以抽象程序性知识、优化技能和组合技能。为此，研究者提出SkillWeaver框架，使代理能自主合成可重用的API技能：在新网站发现技能→实践执行→将经验提炼为稳健API。通过迭代探索构建轻量级即插即用API库，实验显示在WebArena和真实网站上的成功率分别提升31.8%和39.8%。强代理合成的API还能提升弱代理性能（WebArena上达54.3%），证明API技能可跨代理共享。
