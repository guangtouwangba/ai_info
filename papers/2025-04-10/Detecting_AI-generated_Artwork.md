# Detecting AI-generated Artwork

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07078v1

## 原始摘要

The high efficiency and quality of artwork generated by Artificial
Intelligence (AI) has created new concerns and challenges for human artists. In
particular, recent improvements in generative AI have made it difficult for
people to distinguish between human-generated and AI-generated art. In this
research, we consider the potential utility of various types of Machine
Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models in distinguishing AI-generated
artwork from human-generated artwork. We focus on three challenging artistic
styles, namely, baroque, cubism, and expressionism. The learning models we test
are Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer
Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our best experimental
results yield a multiclass accuracy of 0.8208 over six classes, and an
impressive accuracy of 0.9758 for the binary classification problem of
distinguishing AI-generated from human-generated art.


## AI 摘要

人工智能(AI)生成艺术的高效性和高质量对人类艺术家提出了新挑战。本研究探讨了机器学习(ML)和深度学习(DL)模型在区分AI生成与人类创作艺术方面的应用潜力，重点分析了巴洛克、立体主义和表现主义三种艺术风格。测试了逻辑回归(LR)、支持向量机(SVM)、多层感知器(MLP)和卷积神经网络(CNN)四种模型。实验结果显示，在六分类任务中取得0.8208的准确率，而在区分AI与人类艺术的二分类任务中达到0.9758的高准确率。这表明机器学习方法能有效识别AI生成的艺术作品。
