## 原始摘要

The high efficiency and quality of artwork generated by Artificial
Intelligence (AI) has created new concerns and challenges for human artists. In
particular, recent improvements in generative AI have made it difficult for
people to distinguish between human-generated and AI-generated art. In this
research, we consider the potential utility of various types of Machine
Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models in distinguishing AI-generated
artwork from human-generated artwork. We focus on three challenging artistic
styles, namely, baroque, cubism, and expressionism. The learning models we test
are Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer
Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our best experimental
results yield a multiclass accuracy of 0.8208 over six classes, and an
impressive accuracy of 0.9758 for the binary classification problem of
distinguishing AI-generated from human-generated art.


## AI 摘要

这篇研究探讨了如何利用机器学习（ML）和深度学习（DL）模型区分AI生成与人类创作的艺术作品。针对巴洛克、立体主义和表现主义三种复杂艺术风格，研究者测试了逻辑回归（LR）、支持向量机（SVM）、多层感知器（MLP）和卷积神经网络（CNN）等模型。实验结果显示，六分类任务的最高准确率达82.08%，而区分AI与人类艺术的二分类任务准确率高达97.58%。该研究为应对生成式AI带来的艺术真伪鉴别挑战提供了有效解决方案。
