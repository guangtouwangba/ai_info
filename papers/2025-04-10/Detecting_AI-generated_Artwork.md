# Detecting AI-generated Artwork

## 原始摘要

The high efficiency and quality of artwork generated by Artificial
Intelligence (AI) has created new concerns and challenges for human artists. In
particular, recent improvements in generative AI have made it difficult for
people to distinguish between human-generated and AI-generated art. In this
research, we consider the potential utility of various types of Machine
Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models in distinguishing AI-generated
artwork from human-generated artwork. We focus on three challenging artistic
styles, namely, baroque, cubism, and expressionism. The learning models we test
are Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer
Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our best experimental
results yield a multiclass accuracy of 0.8208 over six classes, and an
impressive accuracy of 0.9758 for the binary classification problem of
distinguishing AI-generated from human-generated art.


## AI 摘要

随着AI生成艺术的质量和效率提升，区分人类与AI创作的艺术品变得更具挑战性。本研究探讨了机器学习（ML）和深度学习（DL）模型在识别AI生成艺术品方面的潜力，聚焦巴洛克、立体主义和表现主义三种艺术风格。测试的模型包括逻辑回归（LR）、支持向量机（SVM）、多层感知机（MLP）和卷积神经网络（CNN）。实验结果显示，六分类任务的多类准确率达到0.8208，而在区分AI与人类艺术品的二分类任务中，准确率高达0.9758，表明这些模型在艺术鉴别中具有显著效果。
