# Detecting AI-generated Artwork

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07078v1

## 原始摘要

The high efficiency and quality of artwork generated by Artificial
Intelligence (AI) has created new concerns and challenges for human artists. In
particular, recent improvements in generative AI have made it difficult for
people to distinguish between human-generated and AI-generated art. In this
research, we consider the potential utility of various types of Machine
Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models in distinguishing AI-generated
artwork from human-generated artwork. We focus on three challenging artistic
styles, namely, baroque, cubism, and expressionism. The learning models we test
are Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer
Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our best experimental
results yield a multiclass accuracy of 0.8208 over six classes, and an
impressive accuracy of 0.9758 for the binary classification problem of
distinguishing AI-generated from human-generated art.


## AI 摘要

随着AI生成艺术的质量和效率不断提升，区分人类创作与AI作品成为新挑战。本研究探讨了多种机器学习模型（逻辑回归、支持向量机、多层感知器、卷积神经网络）在识别巴洛克、立体主义和表现主义三种艺术风格中的AI生成作品的效果。实验结果显示，六分类任务最高准确率达0.8208，而二分类（人工作品vs AI作品）准确率高达0.9758，表明深度学习模型能有效鉴别艺术作品的来源。该研究为艺术真伪鉴定提供了技术参考。
