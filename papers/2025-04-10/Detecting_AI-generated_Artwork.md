# Detecting AI-generated Artwork

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07078v1

## 原始摘要

The high efficiency and quality of artwork generated by Artificial
Intelligence (AI) has created new concerns and challenges for human artists. In
particular, recent improvements in generative AI have made it difficult for
people to distinguish between human-generated and AI-generated art. In this
research, we consider the potential utility of various types of Machine
Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models in distinguishing AI-generated
artwork from human-generated artwork. We focus on three challenging artistic
styles, namely, baroque, cubism, and expressionism. The learning models we test
are Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer
Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our best experimental
results yield a multiclass accuracy of 0.8208 over six classes, and an
impressive accuracy of 0.9758 for the binary classification problem of
distinguishing AI-generated from human-generated art.


## AI 摘要

随着AI生成艺术的质量和效率提升，区分人工作品与AI作品成为新挑战。本研究探索了机器学习（LR、SVM、MLP）和深度学习（CNN）模型在识别巴洛克、立体主义和表现主义三种复杂艺术风格中的表现。实验表明，模型在六分类任务中达到0.8208准确率，而在二分类（人工作品vs AI作品）中表现尤为突出，准确率达0.9758。该研究为艺术真伪鉴别提供了有效的技术方案，凸显了AI在艺术认证领域的应用潜力。
