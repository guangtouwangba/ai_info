# Beyond the Hype: A dispassionate look at vision-language models in medical scenario

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08704v2

## 原始摘要

Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, garnering significant attention
in AI communities. However, their performance and reliability in specialized
domains such as medicine remain insufficiently assessed. In particular, most
assessments over-concentrate on evaluating VLMs based on simple Visual Question
Answering (VQA) on multi-modality data, while ignoring the in-depth
characteristics of LVLMs. In this study, we introduce RadVUQA, a novel
Radiological Visual Understanding and Question Answering benchmark, to
comprehensively evaluate existing LVLMs. RadVUQA mainly validates LVLMs across
five dimensions: 1) Anatomical understanding, assessing the models' ability to
visually identify biological structures; 2) Multimodal comprehension, which
involves the capability of interpreting linguistic and visual instructions to
produce desired outcomes; 3) Quantitative and spatial reasoning, evaluating the
models' spatial awareness and proficiency in combining quantitative analysis
with visual and linguistic information; 4) Physiological knowledge, measuring
the models' capability to comprehend functions and mechanisms of organs and
systems; and 5) Robustness, which assesses the models' capabilities against
unharmonized and synthetic data. The results indicate that both generalized
LVLMs and medical-specific LVLMs have critical deficiencies with weak
multimodal comprehension and quantitative reasoning capabilities. Our findings
reveal the large gap between existing LVLMs and clinicians, highlighting the
urgent need for more robust and intelligent LVLMs. The code is available at

## AI 摘要

近期大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)在通用领域表现优异，但在医学等专业领域仍缺乏系统评估。研究团队提出RadVUQA基准，从五个维度全面评估LVLMs：1)解剖结构识别；2)多模态理解；3)定量与空间推理；4)生理知识；5)对抗干扰能力。测试发现，现有通用和医疗专用LVLMs在多模态理解和定量推理方面存在明显不足，与临床医生水平差距显著。研究表明亟需开发更鲁棒、智能的医疗LVLMs。相关代码已开源。
