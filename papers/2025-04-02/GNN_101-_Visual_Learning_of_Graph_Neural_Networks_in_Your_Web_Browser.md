# GNN 101: Visual Learning of Graph Neural Networks in Your Web Browser

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17849v3

## 原始摘要

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success across various
applications. However, their complex structures and inner workings can be
challenging for non-AI experts to understand. To address this issue, this study
presents \name{}, an educational visualization tool for interactive learning of
GNNs. GNN 101 introduces a set of animated visualizations that seamlessly
integrate mathematical formulas with visualizations via multiple levels of
abstraction, including a model overview, layer operations, and detailed
calculations. Users can easily switch between two complementary views: a
node-link view that offers an intuitive understanding of the graph data, and a
matrix view that provides a space-efficient and comprehensive overview of all
features and their transformations across layers. GNN 101 was designed and
developed based on close collaboration with four GNN experts and deployment in
three GNN-related courses. We demonstrated the usability and effectiveness of
GNN 101 via use cases and user studies with both GNN teaching assistants and
students. To ensure broad educational access, GNN 101 is open-source and
available directly in web browsers without requiring any installations.


## AI 摘要

该研究开发了GNN 101，一个用于图神经网络(GNN)交互式学习的教育可视化工具。该工具通过动画可视化将数学公式与多层次抽象(包括模型概览、层操作和详细计算)无缝结合，提供节点链接视图和矩阵视图两种互补视角。GNN 101是与四位GNN专家合作开发，并在三门GNN课程中部署。用户研究表明其对教学助理和学生都有效。该工具开源且无需安装，可直接在浏览器中使用，旨在帮助非AI专家理解GNN的复杂结构和内部工作原理。
