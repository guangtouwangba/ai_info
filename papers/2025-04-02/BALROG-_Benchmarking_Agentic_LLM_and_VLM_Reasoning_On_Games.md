# BALROG: Benchmarking Agentic LLM and VLM Reasoning On Games

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13543v2

## 原始摘要

Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) possess
extensive knowledge and exhibit promising reasoning abilities, however, they
still struggle to perform well in complex, dynamic environments. Real-world
tasks require handling intricate interactions, advanced spatial reasoning,
long-term planning, and continuous exploration of new strategies-areas in which
we lack effective methodologies for comprehensively evaluating these
capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce BALROG, a novel benchmark
designed to assess the agentic capabilities of LLMs and VLMs through a diverse
set of challenging games. Our benchmark incorporates a range of existing
reinforcement learning environments with varying levels of difficulty,
including tasks that are solvable by non-expert humans in seconds to extremely
challenging ones that may take years to master (e.g., the NetHack Learning
Environment). We devise fine-grained metrics to measure performance and conduct
an extensive evaluation of several popular open-source and closed-source LLMs
and VLMs. Our findings indicate that while current models achieve partial
success in the easier games, they struggle significantly with more challenging
tasks. Notably, we observe severe deficiencies in vision-based decision-making,
as several models perform worse when visual representations of the environments
are provided. We release BALROG as an open and user-friendly benchmark to
facilitate future research and development in the agentic community. Code and

## AI 摘要

研究人员开发了名为BALROG的新基准测试，用于评估大语言模型(LLMs)和视觉语言模型(VLMs)在复杂动态环境中的代理能力。该测试整合了从简单到极难(如NetHack)的多种强化学习环境，并设计了精细评估指标。研究发现，当前模型在简单任务中表现尚可，但在复杂任务(尤其是基于视觉的决策)中表现欠佳，有些模型在提供视觉信息时表现反而更差。该基准测试已开源，旨在促进智能代理领域的研究发展。
