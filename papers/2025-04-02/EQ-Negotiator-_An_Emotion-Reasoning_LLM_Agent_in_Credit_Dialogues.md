# EQ-Negotiator: An Emotion-Reasoning LLM Agent in Credit Dialogues

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21080v3

## 原始摘要

While large language model (LLM)-based chatbots have been applied for
effective engagement in credit dialogues, their capacity for dynamic emotional
expression remains limited. Current agents primarily rely on passive empathy
rather than affective reasoning. For instance, when faced with persistent
client negativity, the agent should employ strategic emotional adaptation by
expressing measured anger to discourage counterproductive behavior and guide
the conversation toward resolution. This context-aware emotional modulation is
essential for imitating the nuanced decision-making of human negotiators. This
paper introduces an EQ-negotiator that combines emotion sensing from
pre-trained language models (PLMs) with emotional reasoning based on Game
Theory and Hidden Markov Models. It takes into account both the current and
historical emotions of the client to better manage and address negative
emotions during interactions. By fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs)
on public emotion datasets and validating them on the credit dialogue datasets,
our approach enables LLM-based agents to effectively capture shifts in client
emotions and dynamically adjust their response tone based on our emotion
decision policies in real-world financial negotiations. This EQ-negotiator can
also help credit agencies foster positive client relationships, enhancing
satisfaction in credit services.


## AI 摘要

当前基于大语言模型(LLM)的信贷对话机器人虽能有效互动，但情感表达仍显不足。本文提出EQ谈判专家系统，结合预训练语言模型(PLM)的情感识别与基于博弈论和隐马尔可夫模型的情感推理。该系统通过分析客户当前和历史情绪，动态调整回应语气，如在持续负面情绪时展现适度愤怒以引导对话。方法在公共情感数据集上微调PLM，并在信贷对话数据上验证，使LLM代理能实时捕捉情绪变化，按情感决策策略响应。这有助于信贷机构改善客户关系，提升服务满意度。
