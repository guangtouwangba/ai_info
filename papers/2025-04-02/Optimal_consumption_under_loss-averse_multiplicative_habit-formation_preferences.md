# Optimal consumption under loss-averse multiplicative habit-formation preferences

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20063v2

## 原始摘要

This paper studies a loss-averse version of the multiplicative habit
formation preference and the corresponding optimal investment and consumption
strategies over an infinite horizon. The agent's consumption preference is
depicted by a general S-shaped utility function of her consumption-to-habit
ratio. By considering the concave envelope of the S-shaped utility and the
associated dual value function, we provide a thorough analysis of the HJB
equation for the concavified problem via studying a related nonlinear free
boundary problem. Based on established properties of the solution to this free
boundary problem, we obtain the optimal consumption and investment policies in
feedback form. Some new and technical verification arguments are developed to
cope with generality of the utility function. The equivalence between the
original problem and the concavified problem readily follows from the structure
of the feedback controls. We also discuss some quantitative properties of the
optimal policies, complemented by illustrative numerical examples and their
financial implications.

本文研究了具有损失厌恶特性的乘性习惯形成偏好及其在无限时间范围内的最优投资与消费策略。作者采用一般S型效用函数描述消费与习惯比率偏好，通过构建S型效用的凹包络及对偶价值函数，深入分析了HJB方程的非线性自由边界问题。基于自由边界问题的解，研究得出了反馈形式的最优消费与投资策略，并开发了新的验证方法以应对效用函数的广泛性。研究还证明了原始问题与凹化问题的等价性，并通过数值算例讨论了最优策略的量化特性及其金融意义。
