## 原始摘要

The complexity and variability inherent in high-resolution pathological
images present significant challenges in computational pathology. While
pathology foundation models leveraging AI have catalyzed transformative
advancements, their development demands large-scale datasets, considerable
storage capacity, and substantial computational resources. Furthermore,
ensuring their clinical applicability and generalizability requires rigorous
validation across a broad spectrum of clinical tasks. Here, we present
PathOrchestra, a versatile pathology foundation model trained via
self-supervised learning on a dataset comprising 300K pathological slides from
20 tissue and organ types across multiple centers. The model was rigorously
evaluated on 112 clinical tasks using a combination of 61 private and 51 public
datasets. These tasks encompass digital slide preprocessing, pan-cancer
classification, lesion identification, multi-cancer subtype classification,
biomarker assessment, gene expression prediction, and the generation of
structured reports. PathOrchestra demonstrated exceptional performance across
27,755 WSIs and 9,415,729 ROIs, achieving over 0.950 accuracy in 47 tasks,
including pan-cancer classification across various organs, lymphoma subtype
diagnosis, and bladder cancer screening. Notably, it is the first model to
generate structured reports for high-incidence colorectal cancer and
diagnostically complex lymphoma-areas that are infrequently addressed by
foundational models but hold immense clinical potential. Overall, PathOrchestra
exemplifies the feasibility and efficacy of a large-scale, self-supervised
pathology foundation model, validated across a broad range of clinical-grade
tasks. Its high accuracy and reduced reliance on extensive data annotation
underline its potential for clinical integration, offering a pathway toward
more efficient and high-quality medical services.


## AI 摘要

PathOrchestra是一种基于自监督学习的大规模病理学基础模型，使用来自多个中心的30万张病理切片训练，涵盖20种组织和器官类型。该模型在112项临床任务中进行了严格评估，包括数字切片预处理、泛癌分类、病变识别、多癌亚型分类、生物标志物评估、基因表达预测和结构化报告生成。结果显示，PathOrchestra在27,755张全切片图像和9,415,729个感兴趣区域中表现优异，在47项任务中准确率超过0.950。值得注意的是，它是首个能为高发结直肠癌和复杂淋巴瘤生成结构化报告的模型。该模型展示了大规模自监督病理基础模型的可行性和有效性，具有较高的临床整合潜力。
