# Pitfalls of Evidence-Based AI Policy

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09618v4

## 原始摘要

Nations across the world are working to govern AI. However, from a technical
perspective, there is uncertainty and disagreement on the best way to do this.
Meanwhile, recent debates over AI regulation have led to calls for
"evidence-based AI policy" which emphasize holding regulatory action to a high
evidentiary standard. Evidence is of irreplaceable value to policymaking.
However, holding regulatory action to too high an evidentiary standard can lead
to systematic neglect of certain risks. In historical policy debates (e.g.,
over tobacco ca. 1965 and fossil fuels ca. 1985) "evidence-based policy"
rhetoric is also a well-precedented strategy to downplay the urgency of action,
delay regulation, and protect industry interests. Here, we argue that if the
goal is evidence-based AI policy, the first regulatory objective must be to
actively facilitate the process of identifying, studying, and deliberating
about AI risks. We discuss a set of 15 regulatory goals to facilitate this and
show that Brazil, Canada, China, the EU, South Korea, the UK, and the USA all
have substantial opportunities to adopt further evidence-seeking policies.


## AI 摘要

全球各国正努力制定AI治理政策，但技术层面仍存在分歧。近期关于"循证AI政策"的讨论强调高标准证据要求，但过度依赖证据可能导致系统性风险忽视。历史经验（如1965年烟草、1985年化石燃料争议）表明，"循证政策"常被用作延缓监管、维护行业利益的策略。研究指出，真正的循证AI政策应以主动识别、研究和审议AI风险为首要目标，并提出15项具体监管建议。巴西、加拿大、中国、欧盟、韩国、英国和美国均需加强证据收集政策的实施。
