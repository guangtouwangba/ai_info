# Values in the Wild: Discovering and Analyzing Values in Real-World Language Model Interactions

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15236v1

## 原始摘要

AI assistants can impart value judgments that shape people's decisions and
worldviews, yet little is known empirically about what values these systems
rely on in practice. To address this, we develop a bottom-up,
privacy-preserving method to extract the values (normative considerations
stated or demonstrated in model responses) that Claude 3 and 3.5 models exhibit
in hundreds of thousands of real-world interactions. We empirically discover
and taxonomize 3,307 AI values and study how they vary by context. We find that
Claude expresses many practical and epistemic values, and typically supports
prosocial human values while resisting values like "moral nihilism". While some
values appear consistently across contexts (e.g. "transparency"), many are more
specialized and context-dependent, reflecting the diversity of human
interlocutors and their varied contexts. For example, "harm prevention" emerges
when Claude resists users, "historical accuracy" when responding to queries
about controversial events, "healthy boundaries" when asked for relationship
advice, and "human agency" in technology ethics discussions. By providing the
first large-scale empirical mapping of AI values in deployment, our work
creates a foundation for more grounded evaluation and design of values in AI
systems.


## AI 摘要

本研究开发了一种自下而上、保护隐私的方法，从Claude 3和3.5模型的实际对话中提取了3,307种AI价值观。分析发现，Claude主要支持亲社会价值观（如透明度、伤害预防），反对"道德虚无主义"等价值观。这些价值观呈现情境依赖性：在抵制用户时体现"伤害预防"，历史争议话题中强调"历史准确性"，情感咨询时注重"健康边界"，科技伦理讨论中重视"人类能动性"。研究首次大规模实证揭示了AI系统在实际应用中的价值观图谱，为AI价值观的评估和设计提供了基础。
