# Values in the Wild: Discovering and Analyzing Values in Real-World Language Model Interactions

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15236v1

## 原始摘要

AI assistants can impart value judgments that shape people's decisions and
worldviews, yet little is known empirically about what values these systems
rely on in practice. To address this, we develop a bottom-up,
privacy-preserving method to extract the values (normative considerations
stated or demonstrated in model responses) that Claude 3 and 3.5 models exhibit
in hundreds of thousands of real-world interactions. We empirically discover
and taxonomize 3,307 AI values and study how they vary by context. We find that
Claude expresses many practical and epistemic values, and typically supports
prosocial human values while resisting values like "moral nihilism". While some
values appear consistently across contexts (e.g. "transparency"), many are more
specialized and context-dependent, reflecting the diversity of human
interlocutors and their varied contexts. For example, "harm prevention" emerges
when Claude resists users, "historical accuracy" when responding to queries
about controversial events, "healthy boundaries" when asked for relationship
advice, and "human agency" in technology ethics discussions. By providing the
first large-scale empirical mapping of AI values in deployment, our work
creates a foundation for more grounded evaluation and design of values in AI
systems.


## AI 摘要

这项研究开发了一种隐私保护方法，通过分析Claude 3和3.5模型在数十万次真实对话中的表现，首次大规模实证研究了AI系统的价值观表达。研究发现，Claude展现出3,307种价值观，主要支持亲社会价值观（如透明度、伤害预防），反对道德虚无主义等。价值观呈现情境依赖性：历史准确性出现在争议事件讨论中，健康边界出现在情感建议时，人类自主性出现在科技伦理对话中。该研究为AI价值观的评估和设计提供了实证基础，揭示了AI系统如何在不同情境中传递多样化的人类价值观。
