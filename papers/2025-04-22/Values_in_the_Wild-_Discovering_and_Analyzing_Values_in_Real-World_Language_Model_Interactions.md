# Values in the Wild: Discovering and Analyzing Values in Real-World Language Model Interactions

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15236v1

## 原始摘要

AI assistants can impart value judgments that shape people's decisions and
worldviews, yet little is known empirically about what values these systems
rely on in practice. To address this, we develop a bottom-up,
privacy-preserving method to extract the values (normative considerations
stated or demonstrated in model responses) that Claude 3 and 3.5 models exhibit
in hundreds of thousands of real-world interactions. We empirically discover
and taxonomize 3,307 AI values and study how they vary by context. We find that
Claude expresses many practical and epistemic values, and typically supports
prosocial human values while resisting values like "moral nihilism". While some
values appear consistently across contexts (e.g. "transparency"), many are more
specialized and context-dependent, reflecting the diversity of human
interlocutors and their varied contexts. For example, "harm prevention" emerges
when Claude resists users, "historical accuracy" when responding to queries
about controversial events, "healthy boundaries" when asked for relationship
advice, and "human agency" in technology ethics discussions. By providing the
first large-scale empirical mapping of AI values in deployment, our work
creates a foundation for more grounded evaluation and design of values in AI
systems.


## AI 摘要

研究人员开发了一种隐私保护方法，从Claude 3/3.5模型的数十万次真实交互中提取出3,307种AI价值观。研究发现，Claude主要支持亲社会的实用性和认知性价值观（如"透明度"），同时抵制"道德虚无主义"等价值观。这些价值观呈现明显的情境依赖性：在抵制用户时体现"伤害预防"，回答争议事件时强调"历史准确性"，提供情感建议时注重"健康界限"，技术伦理讨论中重视"人类自主权"。该研究首次大规模实证分析了AI系统在实际应用中的价值观表现，为AI价值观评估和设计奠定了基础。
