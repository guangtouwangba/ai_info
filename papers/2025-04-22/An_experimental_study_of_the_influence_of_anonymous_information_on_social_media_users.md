# An experimental study of the influence of anonymous information on social media users

## 原始摘要

Increasingly, people use social media for their day-to-day interactions and
as a source of information, even though much of this information is practically
anonymous. This raises the question: does anonymous information influence its
recipients? We conducted an online, two-phase, preregistered experiment using a
nationally representative sample of participants from the U.S. to find the
answer. To avoid biases of opinions among participants, in the first phase,
each participant examines ten Rorschach inkblots and chooses one of four
opinions assigned to each inkblot. In the second phase, the participants are
randomly assigned to one of four distinct information conditions and are asked
to revisit their opinions for the same ten inkblots. Conditions ranged from
repeating phase one to receiving anonymous comments about certain opinions.
Results were consistent with the preregistration. Importantly, anonymous
comments shown in phase two influence up to half of the participants' opinion
selections. To better understand the role of anonymous comments in influencing
the selections of opinions, we implemented agent-based modeling (ABM). ABM
results suggest that a straightforward mechanism can explain the impact of such
information. Overall, our results indicate that even anonymous information can
have a significant impact on its recipients, potentially altering their
popularity rankings. However, the strength of such influence weakens when
recipients' confidence in their selections increases. Additionally, we found
that participants' confidence in the first phase is inversely related to the
number of change opinions.


## AI 摘要

这项研究通过两阶段实验和基于代理的建模(ABM)发现，匿名社交媒体信息能显著影响用户观点。实验让美国代表性样本参与者先对罗夏墨迹图表达看法，再随机接受不同信息条件(包括匿名评论)后重新选择。结果显示匿名评论改变了近半数参与者的初始选择，但影响程度随个体信心水平增加而减弱。此外，第一阶段信心水平与观点改变数量呈负相关。研究表明，即使匿名信息也能显著改变接收者的观点偏好，但个人信心会削弱这种影响。研究揭示了匿名社交信息影响公众观点的简单机制。
