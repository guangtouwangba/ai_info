# An experimental study of the influence of anonymous information on social media users

## 原始摘要

Increasingly, people use social media for their day-to-day interactions and
as a source of information, even though much of this information is practically
anonymous. This raises the question: does anonymous information influence its
recipients? We conducted an online, two-phase, preregistered experiment using a
nationally representative sample of participants from the U.S. to find the
answer. To avoid biases of opinions among participants, in the first phase,
each participant examines ten Rorschach inkblots and chooses one of four
opinions assigned to each inkblot. In the second phase, the participants are
randomly assigned to one of four distinct information conditions and are asked
to revisit their opinions for the same ten inkblots. Conditions ranged from
repeating phase one to receiving anonymous comments about certain opinions.
Results were consistent with the preregistration. Importantly, anonymous
comments shown in phase two influence up to half of the participants' opinion
selections. To better understand the role of anonymous comments in influencing
the selections of opinions, we implemented agent-based modeling (ABM). ABM
results suggest that a straightforward mechanism can explain the impact of such
information. Overall, our results indicate that even anonymous information can
have a significant impact on its recipients, potentially altering their
popularity rankings. However, the strength of such influence weakens when
recipients' confidence in their selections increases. Additionally, we found
that participants' confidence in the first phase is inversely related to the
number of change opinions.


## AI 摘要

这项研究表明，匿名社交媒体信息能显著影响人们的观点选择。通过两阶段实验（参与者先对罗夏墨迹图发表看法，再接收不同匿名评论反馈），研究发现匿名评论可改变近半数参与者的初始选择。基于代理模型（ABM）分析显示，这种影响机制较为直接，但会随参与者对自身选择的信心增强而减弱。此外，第一阶段选择信心越高的人，后期改变观点的可能性越低。这说明即使匿名信息也能重塑观点流行度，但个人信心是抵消该影响的关键因素。
