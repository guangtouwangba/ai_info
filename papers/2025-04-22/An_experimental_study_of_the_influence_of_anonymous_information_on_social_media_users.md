# An experimental study of the influence of anonymous information on social media users

## 原始摘要

Increasingly, people use social media for their day-to-day interactions and
as a source of information, even though much of this information is practically
anonymous. This raises the question: does anonymous information influence its
recipients? We conducted an online, two-phase, preregistered experiment using a
nationally representative sample of participants from the U.S. to find the
answer. To avoid biases of opinions among participants, in the first phase,
each participant examines ten Rorschach inkblots and chooses one of four
opinions assigned to each inkblot. In the second phase, the participants are
randomly assigned to one of four distinct information conditions and are asked
to revisit their opinions for the same ten inkblots. Conditions ranged from
repeating phase one to receiving anonymous comments about certain opinions.
Results were consistent with the preregistration. Importantly, anonymous
comments shown in phase two influence up to half of the participants' opinion
selections. To better understand the role of anonymous comments in influencing
the selections of opinions, we implemented agent-based modeling (ABM). ABM
results suggest that a straightforward mechanism can explain the impact of such
information. Overall, our results indicate that even anonymous information can
have a significant impact on its recipients, potentially altering their
popularity rankings. However, the strength of such influence weakens when
recipients' confidence in their selections increases. Additionally, we found
that participants' confidence in the first phase is inversely related to the
number of change opinions.


## AI 摘要

该研究通过两阶段实验和基于代理的建模(ABM)发现，匿名社交媒体信息能显著影响用户观点。实验让美国代表性样本参与者先对罗夏墨迹图表达看法，再随机接受不同信息条件(包括匿名评论)。结果显示，匿名评论改变了近半数参与者的初始选择，但个体对自身观点的信心会削弱这种影响。ABM证实这种影响存在简单的作用机制。研究发现，第一阶段的选择信心与观点改变次数呈负相关。这表明即使匿名信息也能改变观点流行度，但接收者的信心水平是关键调节因素。(100字)
