# An experimental study of the influence of anonymous information on social media users

## 原始摘要

Increasingly, people use social media for their day-to-day interactions and
as a source of information, even though much of this information is practically
anonymous. This raises the question: does anonymous information influence its
recipients? We conducted an online, two-phase, preregistered experiment using a
nationally representative sample of participants from the U.S. to find the
answer. To avoid biases of opinions among participants, in the first phase,
each participant examines ten Rorschach inkblots and chooses one of four
opinions assigned to each inkblot. In the second phase, the participants are
randomly assigned to one of four distinct information conditions and are asked
to revisit their opinions for the same ten inkblots. Conditions ranged from
repeating phase one to receiving anonymous comments about certain opinions.
Results were consistent with the preregistration. Importantly, anonymous
comments shown in phase two influence up to half of the participants' opinion
selections. To better understand the role of anonymous comments in influencing
the selections of opinions, we implemented agent-based modeling (ABM). ABM
results suggest that a straightforward mechanism can explain the impact of such
information. Overall, our results indicate that even anonymous information can
have a significant impact on its recipients, potentially altering their
popularity rankings. However, the strength of such influence weakens when
recipients' confidence in their selections increases. Additionally, we found
that participants' confidence in the first phase is inversely related to the
number of change opinions.


## AI 摘要

这项研究通过两阶段实验和基于代理的建模(ABM)发现，匿名社交媒体信息能显著影响人们的观点选择。实验采用罗夏墨迹测试，结果显示匿名评论能改变近半数参与者的初始选择，但影响程度会随参与者自信水平上升而减弱。第一阶段自信度高的参与者后期改变观点的次数较少。研究表明，即使匿名信息也能显著改变接收者的观点偏好，从而影响观点的流行度排名。这揭示了社交媒体匿名信息对公众认知的潜在影响力，同时指出个人自信度是抵抗这种影响的关键因素。
