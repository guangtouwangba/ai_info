# BlendRL: A Framework for Merging Symbolic and Neural Policy Learning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11689v2

## 原始摘要

Humans can leverage both symbolic reasoning and intuitive reactions. In
contrast, reinforcement learning policies are typically encoded in either
opaque systems like neural networks or symbolic systems that rely on predefined
symbols and rules. This disjointed approach severely limits the agents'
capabilities, as they often lack either the flexible low-level reaction
characteristic of neural agents or the interpretable reasoning of symbolic
agents. To overcome this challenge, we introduce BlendRL, a neuro-symbolic RL
framework that harmoniously integrates both paradigms within RL agents that use
mixtures of both logic and neural policies. We empirically demonstrate that
BlendRL agents outperform both neural and symbolic baselines in standard Atari
environments, and showcase their robustness to environmental changes.
Additionally, we analyze the interaction between neural and symbolic policies,
illustrating how their hybrid use helps agents overcome each other's
limitations.


## AI 摘要

BlendRL是一种新型的神经符号强化学习框架，将神经网络的灵活反应能力与符号系统的可解释推理相结合。传统强化学习策略通常仅依赖神经网络（不透明）或预定义的符号规则（僵化），而BlendRL通过混合逻辑策略与神经策略，使智能体兼具两者的优势。实验表明，在Atari游戏中，BlendRL智能体表现优于纯神经或纯符号基线，且对环境变化更具鲁棒性。研究还揭示了神经与符号策略的互补机制——二者协同克服了彼此的局限性（如神经网络的不可解释性或符号系统的低适应性）。
