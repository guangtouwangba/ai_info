# BlendRL: A Framework for Merging Symbolic and Neural Policy Learning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11689v2

## 原始摘要

Humans can leverage both symbolic reasoning and intuitive reactions. In
contrast, reinforcement learning policies are typically encoded in either
opaque systems like neural networks or symbolic systems that rely on predefined
symbols and rules. This disjointed approach severely limits the agents'
capabilities, as they often lack either the flexible low-level reaction
characteristic of neural agents or the interpretable reasoning of symbolic
agents. To overcome this challenge, we introduce BlendRL, a neuro-symbolic RL
framework that harmoniously integrates both paradigms within RL agents that use
mixtures of both logic and neural policies. We empirically demonstrate that
BlendRL agents outperform both neural and symbolic baselines in standard Atari
environments, and showcase their robustness to environmental changes.
Additionally, we analyze the interaction between neural and symbolic policies,
illustrating how their hybrid use helps agents overcome each other's
limitations.


## AI 摘要

BlendRL是一种新型神经符号强化学习框架，将神经网络和符号系统有机结合，克服了传统RL代理在灵活反应和可解释推理上的局限性。实验表明，BlendRL在Atari游戏中表现优于纯神经或纯符号基线，且对环境变化更具鲁棒性。该框架通过混合使用逻辑策略和神经策略，使代理能相互弥补不足，兼具神经网络的低层反应能力和符号系统的高层推理能力，为智能体提供了更全面的决策能力。研究还分析了神经与符号策略间的交互机制，验证了混合策略的有效性。
