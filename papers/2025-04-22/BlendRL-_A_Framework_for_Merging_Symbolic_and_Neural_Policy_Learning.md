# BlendRL: A Framework for Merging Symbolic and Neural Policy Learning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11689v2

## 原始摘要

Humans can leverage both symbolic reasoning and intuitive reactions. In
contrast, reinforcement learning policies are typically encoded in either
opaque systems like neural networks or symbolic systems that rely on predefined
symbols and rules. This disjointed approach severely limits the agents'
capabilities, as they often lack either the flexible low-level reaction
characteristic of neural agents or the interpretable reasoning of symbolic
agents. To overcome this challenge, we introduce BlendRL, a neuro-symbolic RL
framework that harmoniously integrates both paradigms within RL agents that use
mixtures of both logic and neural policies. We empirically demonstrate that
BlendRL agents outperform both neural and symbolic baselines in standard Atari
environments, and showcase their robustness to environmental changes.
Additionally, we analyze the interaction between neural and symbolic policies,
illustrating how their hybrid use helps agents overcome each other's
limitations.


## AI 摘要

BlendRL是一个新型的神经符号强化学习框架，将神经网络与符号逻辑策略相结合，克服了传统强化学习代理在灵活反应与可解释推理之间的局限性。实验表明，BlendRL在Atari游戏中表现优于纯神经或纯符号基线模型，并展现出更强的环境适应能力。该框架通过神经与符号策略的协同作用，弥补了彼此的不足，为智能体提供了更全面的决策能力。
