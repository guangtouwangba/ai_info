# BlendRL: A Framework for Merging Symbolic and Neural Policy Learning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11689v2

## 原始摘要

Humans can leverage both symbolic reasoning and intuitive reactions. In
contrast, reinforcement learning policies are typically encoded in either
opaque systems like neural networks or symbolic systems that rely on predefined
symbols and rules. This disjointed approach severely limits the agents'
capabilities, as they often lack either the flexible low-level reaction
characteristic of neural agents or the interpretable reasoning of symbolic
agents. To overcome this challenge, we introduce BlendRL, a neuro-symbolic RL
framework that harmoniously integrates both paradigms within RL agents that use
mixtures of both logic and neural policies. We empirically demonstrate that
BlendRL agents outperform both neural and symbolic baselines in standard Atari
environments, and showcase their robustness to environmental changes.
Additionally, we analyze the interaction between neural and symbolic policies,
illustrating how their hybrid use helps agents overcome each other's
limitations.


## AI 摘要

BlendRL是一个结合神经与符号策略的强化学习框架，旨在克服传统方法中神经网络的低解释性与符号系统缺乏灵活性的问题。该框架通过混合逻辑和神经策略，使智能体兼具灵活反应与可解释推理能力。实验表明，BlendRL在Atari游戏环境中表现优于纯神经或符号基线，并展现出更强的环境适应能力。研究还分析了神经与符号策略的互补作用，证明二者的结合能有效弥补各自的局限性。这一成果为构建更强大、鲁棒的智能体提供了新思路。
