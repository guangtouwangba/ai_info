# BlendRL: A Framework for Merging Symbolic and Neural Policy Learning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11689v2

## 原始摘要

Humans can leverage both symbolic reasoning and intuitive reactions. In
contrast, reinforcement learning policies are typically encoded in either
opaque systems like neural networks or symbolic systems that rely on predefined
symbols and rules. This disjointed approach severely limits the agents'
capabilities, as they often lack either the flexible low-level reaction
characteristic of neural agents or the interpretable reasoning of symbolic
agents. To overcome this challenge, we introduce BlendRL, a neuro-symbolic RL
framework that harmoniously integrates both paradigms within RL agents that use
mixtures of both logic and neural policies. We empirically demonstrate that
BlendRL agents outperform both neural and symbolic baselines in standard Atari
environments, and showcase their robustness to environmental changes.
Additionally, we analyze the interaction between neural and symbolic policies,
illustrating how their hybrid use helps agents overcome each other's
limitations.


## AI 摘要

BlendRL是一个新型的神经符号强化学习框架，将神经网络的灵活反应能力与符号系统的可解释推理相结合。相比单一使用神经网络或符号系统的传统方法，BlendRL通过混合逻辑策略和神经策略，使智能体在标准Atari环境中表现优于两种基线方法，并展现出更强的环境适应能力。研究还分析了神经与符号策略的互补作用，证明这种混合方法能有效克服各自局限。该工作为解决AI系统在反应灵活性和推理可解释性之间的割裂问题提供了新思路。
