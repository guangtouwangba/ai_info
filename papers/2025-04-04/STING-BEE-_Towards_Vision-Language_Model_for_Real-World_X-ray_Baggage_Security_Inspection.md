# STING-BEE: Towards Vision-Language Model for Real-World X-ray Baggage Security Inspection

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02823v1

## 原始摘要

Advancements in Computer-Aided Screening (CAS) systems are essential for
improving the detection of security threats in X-ray baggage scans. However,
current datasets are limited in representing real-world, sophisticated threats
and concealment tactics, and existing approaches are constrained by a
closed-set paradigm with predefined labels. To address these challenges, we
introduce STCray, the first multimodal X-ray baggage security dataset,
comprising 46,642 image-caption paired scans across 21 threat categories,
generated using an X-ray scanner for airport security. STCray is meticulously
developed with our specialized protocol that ensures domain-aware, coherent
captions, that lead to the multi-modal instruction following data in X-ray
baggage security. This allows us to train a domain-aware visual AI assistant
named STING-BEE that supports a range of vision-language tasks, including scene
comprehension, referring threat localization, visual grounding, and visual
question answering (VQA), establishing novel baselines for multi-modal learning
in X-ray baggage security. Further, STING-BEE shows state-of-the-art
generalization in cross-domain settings. Code, data, and models are available

## AI 摘要

该研究提出了首个多模态X射线行李安检数据集STCray，包含46,642张图像-文本配对的扫描图像，涵盖21种威胁类别。通过专门设计的协议生成领域感知的连贯文本描述，用于训练视觉AI助手STING-BEE。该系统支持场景理解、威胁定位、视觉问答等多种视觉-语言任务，在X射线安检领域建立了多模态学习新基准。STING-BEE在跨域场景中表现出优异的泛化能力。相关代码、数据和模型已开源。该研究解决了现有数据集在真实威胁表示和封闭集范式方面的局限性。
