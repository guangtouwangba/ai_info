# Measuring temporal effects of agent knowledge by date-controlled tool use

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04188v2

## 原始摘要

Temporal progression is an integral part of knowledge accumulation and
update. Web search is frequently adopted as grounding for agent knowledge, yet
an improper configuration affects the quality of the agent's responses. Here,
we assess the agent behavior using distinct date-controlled tools (DCTs) as
stress test to measure the knowledge variability of large language model (LLM)
agents. We demonstrate the temporal effects of an LLM agent as a writing
assistant, which uses web search to complete scientific publication abstracts.
We show that the temporality of search engine translates into tool-dependent
agent performance but can be alleviated with base model choice and explicit
reasoning instructions such as chain-of-thought prompting. Our results indicate
that agent design and evaluations should take a dynamical view and implement
measures to account for the temporal influence of external resources to ensure
reliability.


## AI 摘要

该研究评估了大型语言模型（LLM）代理在时间知识更新中的表现，通过日期控制工具（DCT）测试其对科学摘要写作的影响。结果表明，搜索引擎的时间性会导致代理性能依赖工具，但可通过选择基础模型和链式思维（chain-of-thought）等显式推理指令缓解。研究强调，代理设计和评估需动态考虑外部资源的时间影响，以确保可靠性。
