# Systematic Evaluation of Large Vision-Language Models for Surgical Artificial Intelligence

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02799v1

## 原始摘要

Large Vision-Language Models offer a new paradigm for AI-driven image
understanding, enabling models to perform tasks without task-specific training.
This flexibility holds particular promise across medicine, where
expert-annotated data is scarce. Yet, VLMs' practical utility in
intervention-focused domains--especially surgery, where decision-making is
subjective and clinical scenarios are variable--remains uncertain. Here, we
present a comprehensive analysis of 11 state-of-the-art VLMs across 17 key
visual understanding tasks in surgical AI--from anatomy recognition to skill
assessment--using 13 datasets spanning laparoscopic, robotic, and open
procedures. In our experiments, VLMs demonstrate promising generalizability, at
times outperforming supervised models when deployed outside their training
setting. In-context learning, incorporating examples during testing, boosted
performance up to three-fold, suggesting adaptability as a key strength. Still,
tasks requiring spatial or temporal reasoning remained difficult. Beyond
surgery, our findings offer insights into VLMs' potential for tackling complex
and dynamic scenarios in clinical and broader real-world applications.


## AI 摘要

大型视觉语言模型(VLMs)为AI驱动的图像理解提供了新范式，无需任务特定训练即可执行任务。研究表明，在手术AI领域的17项视觉理解任务中，11种先进VLM表现出良好的泛化能力，有时甚至超越监督模型。上下文学习可将性能提升三倍，突显其适应能力优势。然而，需要时空推理的任务仍具挑战性。该研究不仅验证了VLM在稀缺专家标注数据的医疗领域(特别是主观性强、场景多变的手术决策)的应用潜力，也为VLM处理临床及现实世界中复杂动态场景提供了重要见解。
