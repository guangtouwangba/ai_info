# Advancing AI-Scientist Understanding: Making LLM Think Like a Physicist with Interpretable Reasoning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01911v1

## 原始摘要

Large Language Models (LLMs) are playing an expanding role in physics
research by enhancing reasoning, symbolic manipulation, and numerical
computation. However, ensuring the reliability and interpretability of their
outputs remains a significant challenge. In our framework, we conceptualize the
collaboration between AI and human scientists as a dynamic interplay among
three modules: the reasoning module, the interpretation module, and the
AI-scientist interaction module. Recognizing that effective physics reasoning
demands rigorous logical consistency, quantitative precision, and deep
integration with established theoretical models, we introduce the
interpretation module to improve the understanding of AI-generated outputs,
which is not previously explored in the literature. This module comprises
multiple specialized agents, including summarizers, model builders, UI
builders, and testers, which collaboratively structure LLM outputs within a
physically grounded framework, by constructing a more interpretable science
model. A case study demonstrates that our approach enhances transparency,
facilitates validation, and strengthens AI-augmented reasoning in scientific
discovery.


## AI 摘要

大语言模型(LLMs)在物理研究中通过增强推理、符号运算和数值计算发挥着日益重要的作用。为确保其输出的可靠性和可解释性，研究提出由推理模块、解释模块和人机交互模块组成的协作框架。其中创新的解释模块通过多个专业代理(总结器、模型构建器、界面设计器和测试器)将LLM输出结构化，构建基于物理原理的可解释科学模型。案例研究表明，该方法能提高透明度、便于验证，并增强科学发现中AI辅助推理的能力。该框架首次系统探索了AI生成结果的解释性问题，填补了现有研究空白。
