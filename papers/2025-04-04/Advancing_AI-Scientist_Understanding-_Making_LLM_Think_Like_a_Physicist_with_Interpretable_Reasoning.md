# Advancing AI-Scientist Understanding: Making LLM Think Like a Physicist with Interpretable Reasoning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01911v1

## 原始摘要

Large Language Models (LLMs) are playing an expanding role in physics
research by enhancing reasoning, symbolic manipulation, and numerical
computation. However, ensuring the reliability and interpretability of their
outputs remains a significant challenge. In our framework, we conceptualize the
collaboration between AI and human scientists as a dynamic interplay among
three modules: the reasoning module, the interpretation module, and the
AI-scientist interaction module. Recognizing that effective physics reasoning
demands rigorous logical consistency, quantitative precision, and deep
integration with established theoretical models, we introduce the
interpretation module to improve the understanding of AI-generated outputs,
which is not previously explored in the literature. This module comprises
multiple specialized agents, including summarizers, model builders, UI
builders, and testers, which collaboratively structure LLM outputs within a
physically grounded framework, by constructing a more interpretable science
model. A case study demonstrates that our approach enhances transparency,
facilitates validation, and strengthens AI-augmented reasoning in scientific
discovery.


## AI 摘要

该研究提出一个AI与物理学家协作的三模块框架(推理模块、解释模块和人机交互模块)，重点通过创新的解释模块提升大语言模型(LLM)在物理研究中的可靠性和可解释性。解释模块包含多个专业代理(摘要生成器、模型构建器、界面设计器和测试器)，能将LLM输出结构化到物理理论框架中，建立更易解释的科学模型。案例研究表明，该方法能增强AI辅助科学推理的透明度，便于验证结果，并促进科学发现。研究强调了物理推理所需的逻辑一致性、定量精确性和理论整合性，为AI在科研中的应用提供了新思路。
