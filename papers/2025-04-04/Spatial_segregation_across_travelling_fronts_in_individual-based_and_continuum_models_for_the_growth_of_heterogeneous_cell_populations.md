# Spatial segregation across travelling fronts in individual-based and continuum models for the growth of heterogeneous cell populations

## 原始摘要

We consider a partial differential equation model for the growth of
heterogeneous cell populations subdivided into multiple distinct discrete
phenotypes. In this model, cells preferentially move towards regions where they
feel less compressed, and thus their movement occurs down the gradient of the
cellular pressure, which is defined as a weighted sum of the densities (i.e.
the volume fractions) of cells with different phenotypes. To translate into
mathematical terms the idea that cells with distinct phenotypes have different
morphological and mechanical properties, both the cell mobility and the
weighted amount the cells contribute to the cellular pressure vary with their
phenotype. We formally derive this model as the continuum limit of an
on-lattice individual-based model, where cells are represented as single agents
undergoing a branching biased random walk corresponding to phenotype-dependent
and pressure-regulated cell division, death, and movement. Then, we study
travelling wave solutions whereby cells with different phenotypes are spatially
segregated across the invading front. Finally, we report on numerical
simulations of the two models, demonstrating excellent agreement between them
and the travelling wave analysis. The results presented here indicate that
inter-cellular variability in mobility can provide the substrate for the
emergence of spatial segregation across invading cell fronts.

该研究建立了一个偏微分方程模型，描述由多种表型组成的异质性细胞群体的生长动态。模型中，细胞倾向于向压缩较小的区域迁移，其运动方向沿细胞压力梯度下降，而细胞压力由不同表型细胞的密度加权求和定义。通过将细胞表型差异（形态和力学特性）量化为移动性和压力贡献权重的变化，该模型从基于个体的离散模型推导为连续极限。研究发现，不同表型的细胞在入侵前沿呈现空间隔离的波状传播，数值模拟验证了模型一致性，表明细胞移动性差异可导致入侵前沿的空间隔离现象。
