# Spatial segregation across travelling fronts in individual-based and continuum models for the growth of heterogeneous cell populations

## 原始摘要

We consider a partial differential equation model for the growth of
heterogeneous cell populations subdivided into multiple distinct discrete
phenotypes. In this model, cells preferentially move towards regions where they
feel less compressed, and thus their movement occurs down the gradient of the
cellular pressure, which is defined as a weighted sum of the densities (i.e.
the volume fractions) of cells with different phenotypes. To translate into
mathematical terms the idea that cells with distinct phenotypes have different
morphological and mechanical properties, both the cell mobility and the
weighted amount the cells contribute to the cellular pressure vary with their
phenotype. We formally derive this model as the continuum limit of an
on-lattice individual-based model, where cells are represented as single agents
undergoing a branching biased random walk corresponding to phenotype-dependent
and pressure-regulated cell division, death, and movement. Then, we study
travelling wave solutions whereby cells with different phenotypes are spatially
segregated across the invading front. Finally, we report on numerical
simulations of the two models, demonstrating excellent agreement between them
and the travelling wave analysis. The results presented here indicate that
inter-cellular variability in mobility can provide the substrate for the
emergence of spatial segregation across invading cell fronts.


## AI 摘要

该研究提出了一种偏微分方程模型，用于描述由多个离散表型组成的异质性细胞群体的生长。模型中，细胞倾向于向压缩较小的区域移动，其运动方向沿细胞压力梯度下降方向。细胞压力定义为不同表型细胞密度的加权和。研究通过将基于个体的晶格模型转化为连续极限形式，推导出该模型，并分析了细胞表型依赖性和压力调节的分裂、死亡和运动。通过研究行波解，发现不同表型的细胞在入侵前沿呈现空间隔离。数值模拟验证了模型与行波分析的一致性，表明细胞迁移能力的变异性可导致入侵前沿的空间隔离。
