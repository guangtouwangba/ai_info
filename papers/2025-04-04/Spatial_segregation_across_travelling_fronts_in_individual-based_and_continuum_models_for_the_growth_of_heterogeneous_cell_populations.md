# Spatial segregation across travelling fronts in individual-based and continuum models for the growth of heterogeneous cell populations

## 原始摘要

We consider a partial differential equation model for the growth of
heterogeneous cell populations subdivided into multiple distinct discrete
phenotypes. In this model, cells preferentially move towards regions where they
feel less compressed, and thus their movement occurs down the gradient of the
cellular pressure, which is defined as a weighted sum of the densities (i.e.
the volume fractions) of cells with different phenotypes. To translate into
mathematical terms the idea that cells with distinct phenotypes have different
morphological and mechanical properties, both the cell mobility and the
weighted amount the cells contribute to the cellular pressure vary with their
phenotype. We formally derive this model as the continuum limit of an
on-lattice individual-based model, where cells are represented as single agents
undergoing a branching biased random walk corresponding to phenotype-dependent
and pressure-regulated cell division, death, and movement. Then, we study
travelling wave solutions whereby cells with different phenotypes are spatially
segregated across the invading front. Finally, we report on numerical
simulations of the two models, demonstrating excellent agreement between them
and the travelling wave analysis. The results presented here indicate that
inter-cellular variability in mobility can provide the substrate for the
emergence of spatial segregation across invading cell fronts.

该研究提出了一种偏微分方程模型，描述由多个不同表型组成的异质细胞群体生长。模型假设细胞会向压缩较小的区域迁移，其运动方向沿细胞压力梯度下降方向。细胞压力定义为不同表型细胞密度的加权和，且细胞的运动性和压力贡献权重随表型变化。研究从基于个体的格子模型推导出该连续模型，分析了细胞表型依赖和压力调节的分裂、死亡及迁移行为。通过研究行波解和数值模拟，发现细胞运动性的差异会导致入侵前沿出现空间隔离现象。结果揭示了细胞运动性变异在群体空间分布模式形成中的作用。
