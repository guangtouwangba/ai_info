# Do Two AI Scientists Agree?

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02822v1

## 原始摘要

When two AI models are trained on the same scientific task, do they learn the
same theory or two different theories? Throughout history of science, we have
witnessed the rise and fall of theories driven by experimental validation or
falsification: many theories may co-exist when experimental data is lacking,
but the space of survived theories become more constrained with more
experimental data becoming available. We show the same story is true for AI
scientists. With increasingly more systems provided in training data, AI
scientists tend to converge in the theories they learned, although sometimes
they form distinct groups corresponding to different theories. To
mechanistically interpret what theories AI scientists learn and quantify their
agreement, we propose MASS, Hamiltonian-Lagrangian neural networks as AI
Scientists, trained on standard problems in physics, aggregating training
results across many seeds simulating the different configurations of AI
scientists. Our findings suggests for AI scientists switch from learning a
Hamiltonian theory in simple setups to a Lagrangian formulation when more
complex systems are introduced. We also observe strong seed dependence of the
training dynamics and final learned weights, controlling the rise and fall of
relevant theories. We finally demonstrate that not only can our neural networks
aid interpretability, it can also be applied to higher dimensional problems.


## AI 摘要

研究表明，当两个AI模型在同一科学任务上训练时，它们可能学习相同或不同的理论，这与科学史上理论随实验数据增多而收敛的现象类似。通过MASS（Hamiltonian-Lagrangian神经网络）框架对物理问题进行多组训练发现：AI科学家的理论选择受训练数据复杂度影响——简单系统倾向于哈密顿理论，复杂系统转向拉格朗日表述。训练动态和最终权重高度依赖随机种子，导致不同理论的形成。该框架不仅增强了模型可解释性，还能扩展到高维问题，揭示了AI理论学习的动态演化与人类科学发展的相似性。
