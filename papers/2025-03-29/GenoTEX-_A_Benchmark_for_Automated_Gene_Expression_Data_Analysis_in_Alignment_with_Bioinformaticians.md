# GenoTEX: A Benchmark for Automated Gene Expression Data Analysis in Alignment with Bioinformaticians

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15341v2

## 原始摘要

Recent advancements in machine learning have significantly improved the
identification of disease-associated genes from gene expression datasets.
However, these processes often require extensive expertise and manual effort,
limiting their scalability. Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown
promise in automating these tasks due to their increasing problem-solving
abilities. To support the evaluation and development of such methods, we
introduce GenoTEX, a benchmark dataset for the automated analysis of gene
expression data. GenoTEX provides annotated code and results for solving a wide
range of gene identification problems, encompassing dataset selection,
preprocessing, and statistical analysis, in a pipeline that follows
computational genomics standards. The benchmark includes expert-curated
annotations from bioinformaticians to ensure accuracy and reliability. To
provide baselines for these tasks, we present GenoAgent, a team of LLM-based
agents that adopt a multi-step programming workflow with flexible
self-correction, to collaboratively analyze gene expression datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate the potential of LLM-based methods in analyzing genomic
data, while error analysis highlights the challenges and areas for future
improvement. We propose GenoTEX as a promising resource for benchmarking and
enhancing automated methods for gene expression data analysis. The benchmark is
available at https://github.com/Liu-Hy/GenoTex.


## AI 摘要

近期机器学习的发展显著提升了从基因表达数据中识别疾病相关基因的能力，但该过程通常需要大量专业知识和人工操作，限制了可扩展性。为此，研究者开发了GenoTEX基准数据集，用于自动化基因表达数据分析的评估，包含标准化的数据处理流程和专家标注。同时提出GenoAgent系统，利用基于大语言模型的多智能体协作框架，通过自校正编程流程实现基因数据分析。实验表明该方法具有潜力，但也揭示了当前挑战。该资源为基因表达分析的自动化方法提供了评估基准，项目已开源。
