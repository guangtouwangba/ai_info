## 原始摘要

Ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of software release decisions is
critical, particularly in safety-critical domains like automotive systems.
Precise analysis of release validation data, often presented in tabular form,
plays a pivotal role in this process. However, traditional methods that rely on
manual analysis of extensive test datasets and validation metrics are prone to
delays and high costs. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising
alternative but face challenges in analytical reasoning, contextual
understanding, handling out-of-scope queries, and processing structured test
data consistently; limitations that hinder their direct application in
safety-critical scenarios. This paper introduces GateLens, an LLM-based tool
for analyzing tabular data in the automotive domain. GateLens translates
natural language queries into Relational Algebra (RA) expressions and then
generates optimized Python code. It outperforms the baseline system on
benchmarking datasets, achieving higher F1 scores and handling complex and
ambiguous queries with greater robustness. Ablation studies confirm the
critical role of the RA module, with performance dropping sharply when omitted.
Industrial evaluations reveal that GateLens reduces analysis time by over 80%
while maintaining high accuracy and reliability. As demonstrated by presented
results, GateLens achieved high performance without relying on few-shot
examples, showcasing strong generalization across various query types from
diverse company roles. Insights from deploying GateLens with a partner
automotive company offer practical guidance for integrating AI into critical
workflows such as release validation. Results show that by automating test
result analysis, GateLens enables faster, more informed, and dependable release
decisions, and can thus advance software scalability and reliability in
automotive systems.
