# Understanding the Logic of Direct Preference Alignment through Logic

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17696v2

## 原始摘要

Recent direct preference alignment algorithms (DPA), such as DPO, have shown
great promise in aligning large language models to human preferences. While
this has motivated the development of many new variants of the original DPO
loss, understanding the differences between these recent proposals, as well as
developing new DPA loss functions, remains difficult given the lack of a
technical and conceptual framework for reasoning about the underlying semantics
of these algorithms. In this paper, we attempt to remedy this by formalizing
DPA losses in terms of discrete reasoning problems. Specifically, we ask: Given
an existing DPA loss, can we systematically derive a symbolic program that
characterizes its semantics? We propose a novel formalism for characterizing
preference losses for single model and reference model based approaches, and
identify symbolic forms for a number of commonly used DPA variants. Further, we
show how this formal view of preference learning sheds new light on both the
size and structure of the DPA loss landscape, making it possible to not only
rigorously characterize the relationships between recent loss proposals but
also to systematically explore the landscape and derive new loss functions from
first principles. We hope our framework and findings will help provide useful
guidance to those working on human AI alignment.


## AI 摘要

最近，直接偏好对齐算法（DPA）如DPO在将大语言模型与人类偏好对齐方面展现出潜力。然而，由于缺乏技术框架来理解这些算法的语义，开发新变体和比较现有方法仍具挑战。本文提出一种形式化方法，将DPA损失函数转化为离散推理问题，揭示其语义结构。通过符号化表征常见DPA变体，该框架不仅阐明了不同损失函数的关系，还支持从第一性原理系统探索新损失函数。这一研究为人类-AI对齐工作提供了理论基础和方法指导，有助于更严谨地设计和分析偏好学习算法。
