# Understanding the Logic of Direct Preference Alignment through Logic

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17696v2

## 原始摘要

Recent direct preference alignment algorithms (DPA), such as DPO, have shown
great promise in aligning large language models to human preferences. While
this has motivated the development of many new variants of the original DPO
loss, understanding the differences between these recent proposals, as well as
developing new DPA loss functions, remains difficult given the lack of a
technical and conceptual framework for reasoning about the underlying semantics
of these algorithms. In this paper, we attempt to remedy this by formalizing
DPA losses in terms of discrete reasoning problems. Specifically, we ask: Given
an existing DPA loss, can we systematically derive a symbolic program that
characterizes its semantics? We propose a novel formalism for characterizing
preference losses for single model and reference model based approaches, and
identify symbolic forms for a number of commonly used DPA variants. Further, we
show how this formal view of preference learning sheds new light on both the
size and structure of the DPA loss landscape, making it possible to not only
rigorously characterize the relationships between recent loss proposals but
also to systematically explore the landscape and derive new loss functions from
first principles. We hope our framework and findings will help provide useful
guidance to those working on human AI alignment.


## AI 摘要

近期直接偏好对齐算法（如DPO）在将大语言模型与人类偏好对齐方面展现出潜力，但缺乏统一的理论框架来理解不同变体的差异。本文提出一种基于离散推理问题的形式化方法，将DPA损失转化为符号程序，揭示其语义本质。该框架不仅可分析现有DPA变体的符号形式，还能通过形式化视角揭示损失函数的规模与结构特征，从而系统性地探索损失函数空间并推导新算法。研究为理解不同损失函数间关系提供了严格依据，并为开发新对齐算法建立了理论基础，有望推动人机对齐领域的发展。
