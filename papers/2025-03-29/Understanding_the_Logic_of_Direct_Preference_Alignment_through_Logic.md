# Understanding the Logic of Direct Preference Alignment through Logic

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17696v2

## 原始摘要

Recent direct preference alignment algorithms (DPA), such as DPO, have shown
great promise in aligning large language models to human preferences. While
this has motivated the development of many new variants of the original DPO
loss, understanding the differences between these recent proposals, as well as
developing new DPA loss functions, remains difficult given the lack of a
technical and conceptual framework for reasoning about the underlying semantics
of these algorithms. In this paper, we attempt to remedy this by formalizing
DPA losses in terms of discrete reasoning problems. Specifically, we ask: Given
an existing DPA loss, can we systematically derive a symbolic program that
characterizes its semantics? We propose a novel formalism for characterizing
preference losses for single model and reference model based approaches, and
identify symbolic forms for a number of commonly used DPA variants. Further, we
show how this formal view of preference learning sheds new light on both the
size and structure of the DPA loss landscape, making it possible to not only
rigorously characterize the relationships between recent loss proposals but
also to systematically explore the landscape and derive new loss functions from
first principles. We hope our framework and findings will help provide useful
guidance to those working on human AI alignment.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种新的形式化框架，用于分析和比较直接偏好对齐（DPA）算法（如DPO）的损失函数。通过将DPA损失转化为符号程序，该研究系统性地揭示了多种常见DPA变体的语义特征，并阐明了不同损失函数之间的关系。这一形式化视角不仅有助于理解现有DPA算法的差异，还能指导从第一原理出发设计新的损失函数。该框架为人类偏好对齐研究提供了理论基础，有望推动更有效的人工智能对齐方法的发展。研究结果对改进大型语言模型与人类偏好的对齐具有重要指导意义。
