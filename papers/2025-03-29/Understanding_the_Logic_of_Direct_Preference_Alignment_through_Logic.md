# Understanding the Logic of Direct Preference Alignment through Logic

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17696v2

## 原始摘要

Recent direct preference alignment algorithms (DPA), such as DPO, have shown
great promise in aligning large language models to human preferences. While
this has motivated the development of many new variants of the original DPO
loss, understanding the differences between these recent proposals, as well as
developing new DPA loss functions, remains difficult given the lack of a
technical and conceptual framework for reasoning about the underlying semantics
of these algorithms. In this paper, we attempt to remedy this by formalizing
DPA losses in terms of discrete reasoning problems. Specifically, we ask: Given
an existing DPA loss, can we systematically derive a symbolic program that
characterizes its semantics? We propose a novel formalism for characterizing
preference losses for single model and reference model based approaches, and
identify symbolic forms for a number of commonly used DPA variants. Further, we
show how this formal view of preference learning sheds new light on both the
size and structure of the DPA loss landscape, making it possible to not only
rigorously characterize the relationships between recent loss proposals but
also to systematically explore the landscape and derive new loss functions from
first principles. We hope our framework and findings will help provide useful
guidance to those working on human AI alignment.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种新的形式化框架，用于分析和理解直接偏好对齐(DPA)算法的语义。通过将现有DPA损失函数转化为符号程序，研究者系统性地揭示了不同DPA变体(如DPO)的内在逻辑。该框架不仅能够严格比较现有损失函数的异同，还能从基本原理出发推导新的损失函数。研究为理解DPA损失函数的规模和结构提供了新视角，有助于推动人类与AI对齐领域的发展。这一形式化方法有望为偏好学习研究提供系统性的指导，促进更有效对齐算法的开发。
