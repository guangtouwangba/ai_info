# Understanding the Logic of Direct Preference Alignment through Logic

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17696v2

## 原始摘要

Recent direct preference alignment algorithms (DPA), such as DPO, have shown
great promise in aligning large language models to human preferences. While
this has motivated the development of many new variants of the original DPO
loss, understanding the differences between these recent proposals, as well as
developing new DPA loss functions, remains difficult given the lack of a
technical and conceptual framework for reasoning about the underlying semantics
of these algorithms. In this paper, we attempt to remedy this by formalizing
DPA losses in terms of discrete reasoning problems. Specifically, we ask: Given
an existing DPA loss, can we systematically derive a symbolic program that
characterizes its semantics? We propose a novel formalism for characterizing
preference losses for single model and reference model based approaches, and
identify symbolic forms for a number of commonly used DPA variants. Further, we
show how this formal view of preference learning sheds new light on both the
size and structure of the DPA loss landscape, making it possible to not only
rigorously characterize the relationships between recent loss proposals but
also to systematically explore the landscape and derive new loss functions from
first principles. We hope our framework and findings will help provide useful
guidance to those working on human AI alignment.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文提出了一个形式化框架，用于分析和比较直接偏好对齐算法(DPA)的损失函数。作者将现有DPA损失(如DPO)转化为符号程序，以系统化理解其语义。该框架能揭示不同损失函数间的关联，并指导新损失函数的设计。研究不仅形式化了单模型和参考模型方法的偏好损失，还分析了DPA损失函数的规模和结构，为人工对齐AI提供了理论基础。这一工作有助于更严谨地比较现有方法，并从第一性原理出发探索新的损失函数。
