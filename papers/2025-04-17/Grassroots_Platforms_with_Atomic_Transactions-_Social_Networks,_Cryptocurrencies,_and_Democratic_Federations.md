# Grassroots Platforms with Atomic Transactions: Social Networks, Cryptocurrencies, and Democratic Federations

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11299v3

## 原始摘要

Grassroots platforms aim to offer an egalitarian alternative to global
platforms. Whereas global platforms can have only a single instance, grassroots
platforms can have multiple instances that emerge and operate independently of
each other and of any global resource except the network, and can interoperate
and coalesce into ever-larger instances once interconnected. Key grassroots
platforms include grassroots social networks, grassroots cryptocurrencies, and
grassroots democratic federations. Previously, grassroots platforms were
defined formally and proven grassroots using unary distributed transition
systems, in which each transition is carried out by a single agent. However,
grassroots platforms cater for a more abstract specification using transactions
carried out atomically by multiple agents, something that cannot be expressed
by unary transition systems. As a result, their original specifications and
proofs were unnecessarily cumbersome and opaque.
  We enhance the notion of a distributed transition system to include atomic
transactions and revisit the notion of grassroots platforms within this new
foundation; present crisp specifications of key grassroots platforms using
atomic transactions: befriending and defriending for grassroots social
networks, coin swaps for grassroots cryptocurrencies, and communities forming,
joining, and leaving a federation for grassroots democratic federations; prove
a general theorem that a platform specified by atomic transactions that are
so-called interactive is grassroots; show that the atomic transactions used to
specify all three platforms are interactive; and conclude that the platforms
thus specified are indeed grassroots. We thus provide a crisp mathematical
foundation for grassroots platforms and a solid and clear starting point from
which their implementation can commence.


## AI 摘要

本文改进了分布式过渡系统的概念，引入原子事务（atomic transactions）来重新定义草根平台（grassroots platforms），使其能更简洁地描述多代理协作行为。研究提出了基于原子事务的清晰规范，包括草根社交网络的交友/解除关系、草根加密货币的币种交换，以及草根民主联盟的社区组建/加入/退出操作。通过证明这些原子事务具有交互性（interactive），研究验证了这些平台符合草根性标准，为草根平台奠定了严谨的数学基础，并为其实现提供了明确起点。新方法克服了原有单代理过渡系统（unary transition systems）的局限性，使规范和证明更简洁直观。
