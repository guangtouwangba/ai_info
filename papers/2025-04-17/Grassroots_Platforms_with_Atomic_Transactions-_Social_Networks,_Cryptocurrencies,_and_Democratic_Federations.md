# Grassroots Platforms with Atomic Transactions: Social Networks, Cryptocurrencies, and Democratic Federations

## 原始摘要

Grassroots platforms aim to offer an egalitarian alternative to global
platforms. Whereas global platforms can have only a single instance, grassroots
platforms can have multiple instances that emerge and operate independently of
each other and of any global resource except the network, and can interoperate
and coalesce into ever-larger instances once interconnected. Key grassroots
platforms include grassroots social networks, grassroots cryptocurrencies, and
grassroots democratic federations. Previously, grassroots platforms were
defined formally and proven grassroots using unary distributed transition
systems, in which each transition is carried out by a single agent. However,
grassroots platforms cater for a more abstract specification using transactions
carried out atomically by multiple agents, something that cannot be expressed
by unary transition systems. As a result, their original specifications and
proofs were unnecessarily cumbersome and opaque.
  We enhance the notion of a distributed transition system to include atomic
transactions and revisit the notion of grassroots platforms within this new
foundation; present crisp specifications of key grassroots platforms using
atomic transactions: befriending and defriending for grassroots social
networks, coin swaps for grassroots cryptocurrencies, and communities forming,
joining, and leaving a federation for grassroots democratic federations; prove
a general theorem that a platform specified by atomic transactions that are
so-called interactive is grassroots; show that the atomic transactions used to
specify all three platforms are interactive; and conclude that the platforms
thus specified are indeed grassroots. We thus provide a crisp mathematical
foundation for grassroots platforms and a solid and clear starting point from
which their implementation can commence.

本文改进了分布式过渡系统的概念，引入原子事务来重新定义草根平台。草根平台（如社交网络、加密货币和民主联盟）通过多个代理的原子事务实现去中心化运作，克服了原有单年代理过渡系统的局限性。研究提出了基于原子事务的清晰规范，验证了关键平台操作（如好友管理、代币交换和联盟参与）的交互性，并证明符合草根性定理。这为草根平台奠定了严谨的数学基础，为其实现提供了明确起点。新方法简化了原有繁琐的证明过程，更精准地刻画了多代理协作的本质特性。
