# Grassroots Platforms with Atomic Transactions: Social Networks, Cryptocurrencies, and Democratic Federations

## 原始摘要

Grassroots platforms aim to offer an egalitarian alternative to global
platforms. Whereas global platforms can have only a single instance, grassroots
platforms can have multiple instances that emerge and operate independently of
each other and of any global resource except the network, and can interoperate
and coalesce into ever-larger instances once interconnected. Key grassroots
platforms include grassroots social networks, grassroots cryptocurrencies, and
grassroots democratic federations. Previously, grassroots platforms were
defined formally and proven grassroots using unary distributed transition
systems, in which each transition is carried out by a single agent. However,
grassroots platforms cater for a more abstract specification using transactions
carried out atomically by multiple agents, something that cannot be expressed
by unary transition systems. As a result, their original specifications and
proofs were unnecessarily cumbersome and opaque.
  We enhance the notion of a distributed transition system to include atomic
transactions and revisit the notion of grassroots platforms within this new
foundation; present crisp specifications of key grassroots platforms using
atomic transactions: befriending and defriending for grassroots social
networks, coin swaps for grassroots cryptocurrencies, and communities forming,
joining, and leaving a federation for grassroots democratic federations; prove
a general theorem that a platform specified by atomic transactions that are
so-called interactive is grassroots; show that the atomic transactions used to
specify all three platforms are interactive; and conclude that the platforms
thus specified are indeed grassroots. We thus provide a crisp mathematical
foundation for grassroots platforms and a solid and clear starting point from
which their implementation can commence.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种改进的分布式过渡系统理论，以支持多代理原子事务，为基层平台（如社交网络、加密货币和民主联盟）提供了更简洁的数学基础。原理论仅支持单代理操作，导致规范复杂且不透明。新方法通过原子事务重新定义了关键平台的操作（如好友管理、代币交换和联盟参与），并证明交互式原子事务构成的平台具有基层特性。研究验证了三种平台的原子事务均满足交互性，从而确认其基层属性。这为基层平台的实现奠定了清晰可靠的理论基础。
