# Shifting Work Patterns with Generative AI

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11436v1

## 原始摘要

We present evidence on how generative AI changes the work patterns of
knowledge workers using data from a 6-month-long, cross-industry, randomized
field experiment. Half of the 6,000 workers in the study received access to a
generative AI tool integrated into the applications they already used for
emails, document creation, and meetings. We find that access to the AI tool
during the first year of its release primarily impacted behaviors that could be
changed independently and not behaviors that required coordination to change:
workers who used the tool spent 3 fewer hours, or 25% less time on email each
week (intent to treat estimate is 1.4 hours) and seemed to complete documents
moderately faster, but did not significantly change time spent in meetings.


## AI 摘要

一项为期6个月、涉及6,000名知识工作者的跨行业随机对照实验显示，使用生成式AI工具显著改变了工作模式。获得AI工具访问权限的员工（集成于现有邮件、文档和会议系统）每周减少3小时（25%）邮件处理时间（意向治疗估计为1.4小时），文档完成速度也有所提升。但AI工具主要影响可独立改变的行为，对需要协调的行为（如会议时间）无显著影响。这些发现表明，生成式AI在初期主要优化个人独立任务效率，而非需要团队协作的工作环节。
