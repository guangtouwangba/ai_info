# Optimal flock formation induced by agent heterogeneity

## 原始摘要

The study of flocking in biological systems has identified conditions for
self-organized collective behavior, inspiring the development of decentralized
strategies to coordinate the dynamics of swarms of drones and other autonomous
vehicles. Previous research has focused primarily on the role of the
time-varying interaction network among agents while assuming that the agents
themselves are identical or nearly identical. Here, we depart from this
conventional assumption to investigate how inter-individual differences between
agents affect the stability and convergence in flocking dynamics. We show that
flocks of agents with optimally assigned heterogeneous parameters significantly
outperform their homogeneous counterparts, achieving 20-40% faster convergence
to desired formations across various control tasks. These tasks include target
tracking, flock formation, and obstacle maneuvering. In systems with
communication delays, heterogeneity can enable convergence even when flocking
is unstable for identical agents. Our results challenge existing paradigms in
multi-agent control and establish system disorder as an adaptive, distributed
mechanism to promote collective behavior in flocking dynamics.


## AI 摘要

传统集群行为研究假设个体同质化，而本研究突破性地探讨了智能体个体差异对群体动力学的影响。研究发现，参数经过最优分配的异构群体比同质群体性能显著提升，在目标追踪、编队形成和避障等任务中收敛速度加快20-40%。在存在通信延迟时，异构性甚至能在同质系统失稳情况下维持收敛。这一成果颠覆了多智能体控制的传统范式，证明系统无序性可作为一种自适应的分布式机制促进群体行为。研究为无人机群等自主系统的协调控制提供了新思路，揭示了生物群体中个体差异的功能意义。
