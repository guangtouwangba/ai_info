# Optimal flock formation induced by agent heterogeneity

## 原始摘要

The study of flocking in biological systems has identified conditions for
self-organized collective behavior, inspiring the development of decentralized
strategies to coordinate the dynamics of swarms of drones and other autonomous
vehicles. Previous research has focused primarily on the role of the
time-varying interaction network among agents while assuming that the agents
themselves are identical or nearly identical. Here, we depart from this
conventional assumption to investigate how inter-individual differences between
agents affect the stability and convergence in flocking dynamics. We show that
flocks of agents with optimally assigned heterogeneous parameters significantly
outperform their homogeneous counterparts, achieving 20-40% faster convergence
to desired formations across various control tasks. These tasks include target
tracking, flock formation, and obstacle maneuvering. In systems with
communication delays, heterogeneity can enable convergence even when flocking
is unstable for identical agents. Our results challenge existing paradigms in
multi-agent control and establish system disorder as an adaptive, distributed
mechanism to promote collective behavior in flocking dynamics.


## AI 摘要

传统研究假设群体智能中的个体相同或相似，主要关注交互网络的作用。本研究突破这一假设，探究个体差异对群体动态稳定性和收敛速度的影响。结果表明，参数经过最优分配的异构群体比同构群体表现更优，在各种控制任务（如目标跟踪、编队形成和避障）中收敛速度提高20-40%。在存在通信延迟的系统中，异构性甚至能在同构群体无法稳定时实现收敛。这一发现挑战了多智能体控制的现有范式，表明系统无序性可作为促进群体行为的自适应分布式机制。
