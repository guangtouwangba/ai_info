# Optimal flock formation induced by agent heterogeneity

## 原始摘要

The study of flocking in biological systems has identified conditions for
self-organized collective behavior, inspiring the development of decentralized
strategies to coordinate the dynamics of swarms of drones and other autonomous
vehicles. Previous research has focused primarily on the role of the
time-varying interaction network among agents while assuming that the agents
themselves are identical or nearly identical. Here, we depart from this
conventional assumption to investigate how inter-individual differences between
agents affect the stability and convergence in flocking dynamics. We show that
flocks of agents with optimally assigned heterogeneous parameters significantly
outperform their homogeneous counterparts, achieving 20-40% faster convergence
to desired formations across various control tasks. These tasks include target
tracking, flock formation, and obstacle maneuvering. In systems with
communication delays, heterogeneity can enable convergence even when flocking
is unstable for identical agents. Our results challenge existing paradigms in
multi-agent control and establish system disorder as an adaptive, distributed
mechanism to promote collective behavior in flocking dynamics.


## AI 摘要

传统群体行为研究通常假设个体同质化，但本研究突破这一范式，探究个体差异对群体动力学的影响。研究发现，参数优化分配的异构智能体群比同质群体表现更优，在各种控制任务（如目标追踪、编队形成和障碍规避）中收敛速度提升20-40%。在存在通信延迟的系统中，异构性甚至能在同质群体不稳定的情况下实现收敛。这一成果挑战了多智能体控制的传统认知，揭示系统无序性可作为促进群体行为的自适应分布式机制。研究为无人机群等自主系统的协调控制提供了新思路。
