# Optimal flock formation induced by agent heterogeneity

## 原始摘要

The study of flocking in biological systems has identified conditions for
self-organized collective behavior, inspiring the development of decentralized
strategies to coordinate the dynamics of swarms of drones and other autonomous
vehicles. Previous research has focused primarily on the role of the
time-varying interaction network among agents while assuming that the agents
themselves are identical or nearly identical. Here, we depart from this
conventional assumption to investigate how inter-individual differences between
agents affect the stability and convergence in flocking dynamics. We show that
flocks of agents with optimally assigned heterogeneous parameters significantly
outperform their homogeneous counterparts, achieving 20-40% faster convergence
to desired formations across various control tasks. These tasks include target
tracking, flock formation, and obstacle maneuvering. In systems with
communication delays, heterogeneity can enable convergence even when flocking
is unstable for identical agents. Our results challenge existing paradigms in
multi-agent control and establish system disorder as an adaptive, distributed
mechanism to promote collective behavior in flocking dynamics.


## AI 摘要

研究表明，在群体行为中引入个体差异能显著提升集群系统的性能。与传统的同质化假设不同，该研究发现当无人机等自主智能体被赋予最优化的异质性参数时，其集群动态的稳定性和收敛速度可提高20-40%。这种优势体现在目标追踪、编队形成和障碍规避等多种任务中。特别值得注意的是，在存在通信延迟的情况下，异质性甚至能使同质系统无法稳定的集群行为实现收敛。这一发现挑战了多智能体控制的现有范式，表明系统无序性可以作为一种自适应的分布式机制来促进集群行为的形成。
