# Optimal flock formation induced by agent heterogeneity

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12297v1

## 原始摘要

The study of flocking in biological systems has identified conditions for
self-organized collective behavior, inspiring the development of decentralized
strategies to coordinate the dynamics of swarms of drones and other autonomous
vehicles. Previous research has focused primarily on the role of the
time-varying interaction network among agents while assuming that the agents
themselves are identical or nearly identical. Here, we depart from this
conventional assumption to investigate how inter-individual differences between
agents affect the stability and convergence in flocking dynamics. We show that
flocks of agents with optimally assigned heterogeneous parameters significantly
outperform their homogeneous counterparts, achieving 20-40% faster convergence
to desired formations across various control tasks. These tasks include target
tracking, flock formation, and obstacle maneuvering. In systems with
communication delays, heterogeneity can enable convergence even when flocking
is unstable for identical agents. Our results challenge existing paradigms in
multi-agent control and establish system disorder as an adaptive, distributed
mechanism to promote collective behavior in flocking dynamics.


## AI 摘要

研究表明，在群体智能系统中引入个体差异性可显著提升集群性能。与传统同质化假设不同，该研究发现当无人机等自主智能体被赋予最优化的异质性参数时，其集群动态的收敛速度比同质系统快20-40%，在目标追踪、编队形成和障碍规避等任务中表现更优。特别在存在通信延迟时，异质性甚至能实现同质系统无法达成的稳定集群。这一发现颠覆了多智能体控制的传统范式，证明系统无序性可作为促进集体行为的自适应分布式机制。研究为生物集群机制和无人机编队控制提供了新思路。
