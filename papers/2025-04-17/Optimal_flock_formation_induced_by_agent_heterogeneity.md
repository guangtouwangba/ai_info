# Optimal flock formation induced by agent heterogeneity

## 原始摘要

The study of flocking in biological systems has identified conditions for
self-organized collective behavior, inspiring the development of decentralized
strategies to coordinate the dynamics of swarms of drones and other autonomous
vehicles. Previous research has focused primarily on the role of the
time-varying interaction network among agents while assuming that the agents
themselves are identical or nearly identical. Here, we depart from this
conventional assumption to investigate how inter-individual differences between
agents affect the stability and convergence in flocking dynamics. We show that
flocks of agents with optimally assigned heterogeneous parameters significantly
outperform their homogeneous counterparts, achieving 20-40% faster convergence
to desired formations across various control tasks. These tasks include target
tracking, flock formation, and obstacle maneuvering. In systems with
communication delays, heterogeneity can enable convergence even when flocking
is unstable for identical agents. Our results challenge existing paradigms in
multi-agent control and establish system disorder as an adaptive, distributed
mechanism to promote collective behavior in flocking dynamics.


## AI 摘要

传统集群行为研究主要假设个体同质化，但本研究突破性地探讨了异质性个体差异对集群动态的影响。研究发现，通过优化分配异质参数，无人机群在目标追踪、编队形成和避障等任务中，收敛速度比同质群体快20-40%。在存在通信延迟时，异质性甚至能实现同质系统无法达成的稳定集群。这一成果颠覆了多智能体控制的传统范式，证明系统无序性可以成为促进集群行为的自适应分布式机制。研究为自主载具集群控制提供了新思路，表明个体差异能显著提升群体性能。
