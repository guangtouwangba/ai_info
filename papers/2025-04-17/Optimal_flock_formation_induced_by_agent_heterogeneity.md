# Optimal flock formation induced by agent heterogeneity

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12297v1

## 原始摘要

The study of flocking in biological systems has identified conditions for
self-organized collective behavior, inspiring the development of decentralized
strategies to coordinate the dynamics of swarms of drones and other autonomous
vehicles. Previous research has focused primarily on the role of the
time-varying interaction network among agents while assuming that the agents
themselves are identical or nearly identical. Here, we depart from this
conventional assumption to investigate how inter-individual differences between
agents affect the stability and convergence in flocking dynamics. We show that
flocks of agents with optimally assigned heterogeneous parameters significantly
outperform their homogeneous counterparts, achieving 20-40% faster convergence
to desired formations across various control tasks. These tasks include target
tracking, flock formation, and obstacle maneuvering. In systems with
communication delays, heterogeneity can enable convergence even when flocking
is unstable for identical agents. Our results challenge existing paradigms in
multi-agent control and establish system disorder as an adaptive, distributed
mechanism to promote collective behavior in flocking dynamics.

该研究打破了传统多智能体群体行为中"同质化"的假设，发现参数异质性分配的群体比同质化群体表现更优：在目标追踪、编队形成和障碍规避等任务中，收敛速度提升20-40%。尤其在存在通信延迟时，异质性甚至能实现同质系统无法达成的稳定集群。研究结果表明，个体差异可作为自适应的分布式机制促进群体行为，这挑战了现有多智能体控制范式，为无人机群等自主系统的协调控制提供了新思路。
