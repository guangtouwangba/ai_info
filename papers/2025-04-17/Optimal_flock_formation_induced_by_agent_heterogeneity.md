# Optimal flock formation induced by agent heterogeneity

## 原始摘要

The study of flocking in biological systems has identified conditions for
self-organized collective behavior, inspiring the development of decentralized
strategies to coordinate the dynamics of swarms of drones and other autonomous
vehicles. Previous research has focused primarily on the role of the
time-varying interaction network among agents while assuming that the agents
themselves are identical or nearly identical. Here, we depart from this
conventional assumption to investigate how inter-individual differences between
agents affect the stability and convergence in flocking dynamics. We show that
flocks of agents with optimally assigned heterogeneous parameters significantly
outperform their homogeneous counterparts, achieving 20-40% faster convergence
to desired formations across various control tasks. These tasks include target
tracking, flock formation, and obstacle maneuvering. In systems with
communication delays, heterogeneity can enable convergence even when flocking
is unstable for identical agents. Our results challenge existing paradigms in
multi-agent control and establish system disorder as an adaptive, distributed
mechanism to promote collective behavior in flocking dynamics.


## AI 摘要

传统集群行为研究通常假设个体同质，但本研究探讨了异质性对集群动态的影响。研究发现，通过优化分配异质参数，集群收敛速度比同质系统快20-40%，在目标追踪、编队和避障等任务中表现更优。在通信延迟情况下，异质性甚至能实现同质系统无法达成的稳定集群。这一发现挑战了多智能体控制的传统范式，表明系统异质性可作为促进集群行为的自适应分布式机制。研究为无人机群等自主系统的协调控制提供了新思路，证实了生物系统中个体差异的功能性价值。
