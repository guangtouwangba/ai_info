## 原始摘要

Advances in generative AI have rapidly expanded the potential of computers to
perform or assist in a wide array of tasks traditionally performed by humans.
We analyze a large, real-world randomized experiment of over 6,000 workers at
56 firms to present some of the earliest evidence on how these technologies are
changing the way knowledge workers do their jobs. We find substantial time
savings on common core tasks across a wide range of industries and occupations:
workers who make use of this technology spent half an hour less reading email
each week and completed documents 12% faster. Despite the newness of the
technology, nearly 40% of workers who were given access to the tool used it
regularly in their work throughout the 6-month study.


## AI 摘要

一项针对56家公司的6000多名知识工作者的实验研究表明，生成式AI能显著提升工作效率。使用该技术的员工每周阅读邮件时间减少半小时，文档处理速度提高12%。尽管技术较新，但在6个月的研究中，近40%的使用者持续将其应用于日常工作。这些发现揭示了AI在广泛行业和岗位中的实际应用潜力，能有效节省时间并优化传统工作流程。
