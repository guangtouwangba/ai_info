# Advancing Arabic Speech Recognition Through Large-Scale Weakly Supervised Learning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12254v1

## 原始摘要

Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is crucial for human-machine interaction
in diverse applications like conversational agents, industrial robotics, call
center automation, and automated subtitling. However, developing
high-performance ASR models remains challenging, particularly for low-resource
languages like Arabic, due to the scarcity of large, labeled speech datasets,
which are costly and labor-intensive to produce. In this work, we employ weakly
supervised learning to train an Arabic ASR model using the Conformer
architecture. Our model is trained from scratch on 15,000 hours of weakly
annotated speech data covering both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Dialectal
Arabic (DA), eliminating the need for costly manual transcriptions. Despite the
absence of human-verified labels, our approach attains state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance, exceeding all previous efforts in the field of Arabic ASR on the
standard benchmarks. By demonstrating the effectiveness of weak supervision as
a scalable, cost-efficient alternative to traditional supervised approaches,
paving the way for improved ASR systems in low resource settings.


## AI 摘要

本研究利用弱监督学习方法，基于Conformer架构训练阿拉伯语自动语音识别(ASR)系统。该模型完全使用15,000小时的弱标注语音数据(包含现代标准阿拉伯语和方言阿拉伯语)从头训练，避免了昂贵的人工标注。尽管没有人工验证标签，该方法在标准测试集上取得了当前最优性能，超越了所有先前阿拉伯语ASR研究成果。这项工作证明了弱监督作为一种可扩展、高性价比的替代方案，能够有效解决低资源语言ASR开发面临的标注数据稀缺问题，为资源匮乏环境下的语音识别系统改进开辟了新途径。
