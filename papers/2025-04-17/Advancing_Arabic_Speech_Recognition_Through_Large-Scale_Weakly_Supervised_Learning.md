# Advancing Arabic Speech Recognition Through Large-Scale Weakly Supervised Learning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12254v1

## 原始摘要

Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is crucial for human-machine interaction
in diverse applications like conversational agents, industrial robotics, call
center automation, and automated subtitling. However, developing
high-performance ASR models remains challenging, particularly for low-resource
languages like Arabic, due to the scarcity of large, labeled speech datasets,
which are costly and labor-intensive to produce. In this work, we employ weakly
supervised learning to train an Arabic ASR model using the Conformer
architecture. Our model is trained from scratch on 15,000 hours of weakly
annotated speech data covering both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Dialectal
Arabic (DA), eliminating the need for costly manual transcriptions. Despite the
absence of human-verified labels, our approach attains state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance, exceeding all previous efforts in the field of Arabic ASR on the
standard benchmarks. By demonstrating the effectiveness of weak supervision as
a scalable, cost-efficient alternative to traditional supervised approaches,
paving the way for improved ASR systems in low resource settings.


## AI 摘要

该研究利用弱监督学习方法训练了一个基于Conformer架构的阿拉伯语自动语音识别(ASR)系统。使用15,000小时未经验证的弱标注语音数据(包含现代标准阿拉伯语和方言阿拉伯语)，无需人工转录，实现了最先进的性能表现。该方法克服了阿拉伯语等低资源语言缺乏大规模标注数据集的问题，证明了弱监督作为一种可扩展、高成本效益的替代方案的有效性，为低资源环境下的ASR系统发展提供了新思路。研究在标准基准测试中超越了之前所有阿拉伯语ASR的研究成果。
