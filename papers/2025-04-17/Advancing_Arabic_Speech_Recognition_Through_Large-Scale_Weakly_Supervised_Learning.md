# Advancing Arabic Speech Recognition Through Large-Scale Weakly Supervised Learning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12254v1

## 原始摘要

Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is crucial for human-machine interaction
in diverse applications like conversational agents, industrial robotics, call
center automation, and automated subtitling. However, developing
high-performance ASR models remains challenging, particularly for low-resource
languages like Arabic, due to the scarcity of large, labeled speech datasets,
which are costly and labor-intensive to produce. In this work, we employ weakly
supervised learning to train an Arabic ASR model using the Conformer
architecture. Our model is trained from scratch on 15,000 hours of weakly
annotated speech data covering both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Dialectal
Arabic (DA), eliminating the need for costly manual transcriptions. Despite the
absence of human-verified labels, our approach attains state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance, exceeding all previous efforts in the field of Arabic ASR on the
standard benchmarks. By demonstrating the effectiveness of weak supervision as
a scalable, cost-efficient alternative to traditional supervised approaches,
paving the way for improved ASR systems in low resource settings.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种基于弱监督学习的阿拉伯语自动语音识别(ASR)方法，使用Conformer架构在15,000小时的弱标注语音数据(包含现代标准阿拉伯语和方言)上从头训练模型。该方法无需昂贵的人工转录，在标准基准测试中取得了最先进的性能表现，超越了所有先前阿拉伯语ASR的研究成果。这项研究证明了弱监督学习作为传统监督方法的高效替代方案，能够以较低成本实现可扩展的ASR系统开发，为资源匮乏语言(如阿拉伯语)的语音识别提供了新思路。
