## 原始摘要

Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is crucial for human-machine interaction
in diverse applications like conversational agents, industrial robotics, call
center automation, and automated subtitling. However, developing
high-performance ASR models remains challenging, particularly for low-resource
languages like Arabic, due to the scarcity of large, labeled speech datasets,
which are costly and labor-intensive to produce. In this work, we employ weakly
supervised learning to train an Arabic ASR model using the Conformer
architecture. Our model is trained from scratch on 15,000 hours of weakly
annotated speech data covering both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Dialectal
Arabic (DA), eliminating the need for costly manual transcriptions. Despite the
absence of human-verified labels, our approach attains state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance, exceeding all previous efforts in the field of Arabic ASR on the
standard benchmarks. By demonstrating the effectiveness of weak supervision as
a scalable, cost-efficient alternative to traditional supervised approaches,
paving the way for improved ASR systems in low resource settings.


## AI 摘要

本研究采用弱监督学习方法，基于Conformer架构训练阿拉伯语自动语音识别(ASR)模型。使用15,000小时未经验证的弱标注语音数据（包含现代标准阿拉伯语和方言阿拉伯语），无需人工转录即可从头训练。尽管缺乏人工验证标签，该方法在标准测试集上仍取得最先进的性能表现，超越了此前所有阿拉伯语ASR研究。该成果证明了弱监督学习作为传统监督方法的高效替代方案，能以更低成本实现可扩展的ASR系统开发，特别适用于阿拉伯语等低资源语言场景，为资源匮乏环境下的语音识别改进开辟了新途径。（99字）
