**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12249v1

## 原始摘要

The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging has
revolutionized diagnostic practices, enabling advanced analysis and
interpretation of radiological data. This study presents a comprehensive
evaluation of radiomics-based and deep learning-based approaches for disease
detection in chest radiography, focusing on COVID-19, lung opacity, and viral
pneumonia. While deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), learn directly from image data,
radiomics-based models extract and analyze quantitative features, potentially
providing advantages in data-limited scenarios. This study systematically
compares the diagnostic accuracy and robustness of various AI models, including
Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines
(SVM), and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) for radiomics, against
state-of-the-art computer vision deep learning architectures. Performance
metrics across varying sample sizes reveal insights into each model's efficacy,
highlighting the contexts in which specific AI approaches may offer enhanced
diagnostic capabilities. The results aim to inform the integration of AI-driven
diagnostic tools in clinical practice, particularly in automated and
high-throughput environments where timely, reliable diagnosis is critical. This
comparative study addresses an essential gap, establishing guidance for the
selection of AI models based on clinical and operational needs.


## AI 摘要

这项研究系统评估了基于放射组学和深度学习的AI模型在胸部X光疾病检测（COVID-19、肺部混浊和病毒性肺炎）中的表现。研究比较了决策树、梯度提升、随机森林、SVM和MLP等放射组学模型与CNN、ViT等深度学习架构的诊断准确性和鲁棒性。结果显示，在数据有限时，放射组学模型可能更具优势；而深度学习模型在大数据场景表现更佳。研究通过不同样本量下的性能指标，为临床实践中AI诊断工具的选择提供了实用指导，特别适用于需要快速可靠诊断的自动化高通量医疗环境。
