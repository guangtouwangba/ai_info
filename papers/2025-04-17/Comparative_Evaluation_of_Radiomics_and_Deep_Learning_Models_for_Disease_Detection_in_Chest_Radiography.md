**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12249v1

## 原始摘要

The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging has
revolutionized diagnostic practices, enabling advanced analysis and
interpretation of radiological data. This study presents a comprehensive
evaluation of radiomics-based and deep learning-based approaches for disease
detection in chest radiography, focusing on COVID-19, lung opacity, and viral
pneumonia. While deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), learn directly from image data,
radiomics-based models extract and analyze quantitative features, potentially
providing advantages in data-limited scenarios. This study systematically
compares the diagnostic accuracy and robustness of various AI models, including
Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines
(SVM), and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) for radiomics, against
state-of-the-art computer vision deep learning architectures. Performance
metrics across varying sample sizes reveal insights into each model's efficacy,
highlighting the contexts in which specific AI approaches may offer enhanced
diagnostic capabilities. The results aim to inform the integration of AI-driven
diagnostic tools in clinical practice, particularly in automated and
high-throughput environments where timely, reliable diagnosis is critical. This
comparative study addresses an essential gap, establishing guidance for the
selection of AI models based on clinical and operational needs.


## AI 摘要

该研究系统评估了基于放射组学和深度学习的AI模型在胸部X光疾病检测（COVID-19、肺不张和病毒性肺炎）中的表现。深度学习方法（如CNN和ViT）直接从图像学习，而放射组学方法提取定量特征，在数据有限时可能更具优势。研究比较了决策树、梯度提升、随机森林、SVM、MLP等传统方法与前沿计算机视觉模型的诊断准确性和鲁棒性，分析了不同样本量下的性能表现。结果表明不同AI方法各有优势，为临床实践中根据具体需求选择合适模型提供了指导依据，对自动化高通量诊断环境具有重要意义。
