# BioMaze: Benchmarking and Enhancing Large Language Models for Biological Pathway Reasoning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16660v4

## 原始摘要

The applications of large language models (LLMs) in various biological
domains have been explored recently, but their reasoning ability in complex
biological systems, such as pathways, remains underexplored, which is crucial
for predicting biological phenomena, formulating hypotheses, and designing
experiments. This work explores the potential of LLMs in pathway reasoning. We
introduce BioMaze, a dataset with 5.1K complex pathway problems derived from
real research, covering various biological contexts including natural dynamic
changes, disturbances, additional intervention conditions, and multi-scale
research targets. Our evaluation of methods such as CoT and graph-augmented
reasoning, shows that LLMs struggle with pathway reasoning, especially in
perturbed systems. To address this, we propose PathSeeker, an LLM agent that
enhances reasoning through interactive subgraph-based navigation, enabling a
more effective approach to handling the complexities of biological systems in a
scientifically aligned manner. The dataset and code are available at

## AI 摘要

该研究探索了大语言模型(LLMs)在生物通路推理中的应用，发现现有模型在处理复杂生物系统时存在困难。为此，团队创建了BioMaze数据集，包含5.1K个基于真实研究的通路问题，涵盖自然动态变化、扰动、干预条件等多尺度研究目标。评估显示现有方法(如思维链和图增强推理)在扰动系统中表现不佳。为此，研究者提出PathSeeker代理，通过基于子图的交互式导航增强推理能力，以更科学的方式处理生物系统复杂性。相关数据和代码已开源。
