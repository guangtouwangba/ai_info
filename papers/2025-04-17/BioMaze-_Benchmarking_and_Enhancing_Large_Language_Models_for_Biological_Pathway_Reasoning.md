# BioMaze: Benchmarking and Enhancing Large Language Models for Biological Pathway Reasoning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16660v4

## 原始摘要

The applications of large language models (LLMs) in various biological
domains have been explored recently, but their reasoning ability in complex
biological systems, such as pathways, remains underexplored, which is crucial
for predicting biological phenomena, formulating hypotheses, and designing
experiments. This work explores the potential of LLMs in pathway reasoning. We
introduce BioMaze, a dataset with 5.1K complex pathway problems derived from
real research, covering various biological contexts including natural dynamic
changes, disturbances, additional intervention conditions, and multi-scale
research targets. Our evaluation of methods such as CoT and graph-augmented
reasoning, shows that LLMs struggle with pathway reasoning, especially in
perturbed systems. To address this, we propose PathSeeker, an LLM agent that
enhances reasoning through interactive subgraph-based navigation, enabling a
more effective approach to handling the complexities of biological systems in a
scientifically aligned manner. The dataset and code are available at

## AI 摘要

这篇论文探讨了大型语言模型(LLMs)在生物通路推理中的应用。研究者创建了包含5,100个复杂通路问题的BioMaze数据集，涵盖自然动态变化、扰动、干预条件和多尺度研究目标等生物场景。评估发现LLMs在通路推理，尤其是扰动系统方面表现不佳。为此，团队提出了PathSeeker代理，通过基于子图的交互式导航增强推理能力，更有效地处理复杂生物系统。该研究为LLMs在生物系统推理中的应用提供了新思路和方法。数据集和代码已开源。
