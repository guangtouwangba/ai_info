# BioMaze: Benchmarking and Enhancing Large Language Models for Biological Pathway Reasoning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16660v4

## 原始摘要

The applications of large language models (LLMs) in various biological
domains have been explored recently, but their reasoning ability in complex
biological systems, such as pathways, remains underexplored, which is crucial
for predicting biological phenomena, formulating hypotheses, and designing
experiments. This work explores the potential of LLMs in pathway reasoning. We
introduce BioMaze, a dataset with 5.1K complex pathway problems derived from
real research, covering various biological contexts including natural dynamic
changes, disturbances, additional intervention conditions, and multi-scale
research targets. Our evaluation of methods such as CoT and graph-augmented
reasoning, shows that LLMs struggle with pathway reasoning, especially in
perturbed systems. To address this, we propose PathSeeker, an LLM agent that
enhances reasoning through interactive subgraph-based navigation, enabling a
more effective approach to handling the complexities of biological systems in a
scientifically aligned manner. The dataset and code are available at

## AI 摘要

本文探索了大语言模型(LLMs)在生物通路推理中的应用，提出了BioMaze数据集(包含5.1K个复杂通路问题)和PathSeeker方法。研究发现LLMs在通路推理(尤其是扰动系统)中表现不佳，而基于子图交互导航的PathSeeker能更有效处理生物系统复杂性。该工作填补了LLMs在复杂生物系统推理能力研究的空白，为生物现象预测、假设形成和实验设计提供了新工具。数据集和代码已开源。
