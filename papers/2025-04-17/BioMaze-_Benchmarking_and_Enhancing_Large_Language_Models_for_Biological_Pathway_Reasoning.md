# BioMaze: Benchmarking and Enhancing Large Language Models for Biological Pathway Reasoning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16660v4

## 原始摘要

The applications of large language models (LLMs) in various biological
domains have been explored recently, but their reasoning ability in complex
biological systems, such as pathways, remains underexplored, which is crucial
for predicting biological phenomena, formulating hypotheses, and designing
experiments. This work explores the potential of LLMs in pathway reasoning. We
introduce BioMaze, a dataset with 5.1K complex pathway problems derived from
real research, covering various biological contexts including natural dynamic
changes, disturbances, additional intervention conditions, and multi-scale
research targets. Our evaluation of methods such as CoT and graph-augmented
reasoning, shows that LLMs struggle with pathway reasoning, especially in
perturbed systems. To address this, we propose PathSeeker, an LLM agent that
enhances reasoning through interactive subgraph-based navigation, enabling a
more effective approach to handling the complexities of biological systems in a
scientifically aligned manner. The dataset and code are available at

## AI 摘要

这篇论文探讨了大语言模型(LLMs)在复杂生物系统(如通路)中的推理能力，提出了BioMaze数据集(包含5.1K个真实研究衍生的通路问题)。研究发现LLMs在通路推理(尤其是扰动系统)方面表现不佳，为此提出了PathSeeker方法——一种基于交互式子图导航的LLM代理，能更有效地处理生物系统复杂性。研究覆盖了自然动态变化、干扰、额外干预条件和多尺度研究目标等多种生物情境，评估了CoT和图增强推理等方法，相关数据和代码已开源。
