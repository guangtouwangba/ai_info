# BioMaze: Benchmarking and Enhancing Large Language Models for Biological Pathway Reasoning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16660v4

## 原始摘要

The applications of large language models (LLMs) in various biological
domains have been explored recently, but their reasoning ability in complex
biological systems, such as pathways, remains underexplored, which is crucial
for predicting biological phenomena, formulating hypotheses, and designing
experiments. This work explores the potential of LLMs in pathway reasoning. We
introduce BioMaze, a dataset with 5.1K complex pathway problems derived from
real research, covering various biological contexts including natural dynamic
changes, disturbances, additional intervention conditions, and multi-scale
research targets. Our evaluation of methods such as CoT and graph-augmented
reasoning, shows that LLMs struggle with pathway reasoning, especially in
perturbed systems. To address this, we propose PathSeeker, an LLM agent that
enhances reasoning through interactive subgraph-based navigation, enabling a
more effective approach to handling the complexities of biological systems in a
scientifically aligned manner. The dataset and code are available at

## AI 摘要

大型语言模型(LLMs)在生物领域的应用潜力尚未充分开发，特别是在复杂生物系统(如通路)的推理能力方面。本研究提出BioMaze数据集，包含5.1K个基于真实研究的通路问题，涵盖自然动态变化、扰动、干预条件和多尺度目标等场景。评估发现LLMs在通路推理，尤其是扰动系统方面表现欠佳。为此，研究者开发了PathSeeker智能体，通过基于子图的交互式导航增强推理能力，为处理复杂生物系统提供更有效的科学方法。相关数据和代码已开源。
