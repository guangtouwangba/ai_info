# Feedforward in Generative AI: Opportunities for a Design Space

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14229v2

## 原始摘要

Generative AI (GenAI) models have become more capable than ever at augmenting
productivity and cognition across diverse contexts. However, a fundamental
challenge remains as users struggle to anticipate what AI will generate. As a
result, they must engage in excessive turn-taking with the AI's feedback to
clarify their intent, leading to significant cognitive load and time
investment. Our goal is to advance the perspective that in order for users to
seamlessly leverage the full potential of GenAI systems across various
contexts, we must design GenAI systems that not only provide informative
feedback but also informative feedforward -- designs that tell users what AI
will generate before the user submits their prompt. To spark discussion on
feedforward in GenAI, we designed diverse instantiations of feedforward across
four GenAI applications: conversational UIs, document editors, malleable
interfaces, and automation agents, and discussed how these designs can
contribute to a more rigorous investigation of a design space and a set of
guidelines for feedforward in all GenAI systems.


## AI 摘要

当前生成式AI（GenAI）虽能提升生产力，但用户难以预判其输出，需通过多次交互澄清意图，导致认知负荷和时间消耗。研究提出，GenAI系统应同时提供"前馈信息"（feedforward），即在用户提交指令前展示可能的生成内容，以降低不确定性。团队在对话界面、文档编辑、可塑界面和自动化代理四种场景中设计了前馈方案，旨在推动建立GenAI前馈设计规范，帮助用户更高效地利用AI潜能。这一设计思路有望减少交互摩擦，优化人机协作体验。
