# Feedforward in Generative AI: Opportunities for a Design Space

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14229v2

## 原始摘要

Generative AI (GenAI) models have become more capable than ever at augmenting
productivity and cognition across diverse contexts. However, a fundamental
challenge remains as users struggle to anticipate what AI will generate. As a
result, they must engage in excessive turn-taking with the AI's feedback to
clarify their intent, leading to significant cognitive load and time
investment. Our goal is to advance the perspective that in order for users to
seamlessly leverage the full potential of GenAI systems across various
contexts, we must design GenAI systems that not only provide informative
feedback but also informative feedforward -- designs that tell users what AI
will generate before the user submits their prompt. To spark discussion on
feedforward in GenAI, we designed diverse instantiations of feedforward across
four GenAI applications: conversational UIs, document editors, malleable
interfaces, and automation agents, and discussed how these designs can
contribute to a more rigorous investigation of a design space and a set of
guidelines for feedforward in all GenAI systems.


## AI 摘要

当前，生成式AI（GenAI）虽能提升生产力与认知效率，但用户难以预判其输出，导致需反复交互以澄清意图，增加了认知负担与时间成本。研究提出，为充分发挥GenAI潜力，系统设计需同时提供"反馈"和"前馈"——即在用户提交指令前预展示AI可能生成的内容。通过对话界面、文档编辑器等四个应用场景的原型设计，探讨了前馈机制如何优化用户体验，推动形成系统化的设计准则。这一方向旨在减少用户试错成本，实现更流畅的人机协作。
