# Feedforward in Generative AI: Opportunities for a Design Space

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14229v2

## 原始摘要

Generative AI (GenAI) models have become more capable than ever at augmenting
productivity and cognition across diverse contexts. However, a fundamental
challenge remains as users struggle to anticipate what AI will generate. As a
result, they must engage in excessive turn-taking with the AI's feedback to
clarify their intent, leading to significant cognitive load and time
investment. Our goal is to advance the perspective that in order for users to
seamlessly leverage the full potential of GenAI systems across various
contexts, we must design GenAI systems that not only provide informative
feedback but also informative feedforward -- designs that tell users what AI
will generate before the user submits their prompt. To spark discussion on
feedforward in GenAI, we designed diverse instantiations of feedforward across
four GenAI applications: conversational UIs, document editors, malleable
interfaces, and automation agents, and discussed how these designs can
contribute to a more rigorous investigation of a design space and a set of
guidelines for feedforward in all GenAI systems.


## AI 摘要

当前生成式AI（GenAI）虽能提升生产力，但用户难以预判其输出，导致频繁交互调整意图，增加认知负担和时间成本。研究提出，GenAI系统需同时提供"反馈"和"前馈"设计——即在用户提交指令前展示AI的预期生成内容，以实现无缝协作。团队通过在对话界面、文档编辑、可塑界面和自动化代理四种场景中设计多样化前馈方案，探讨了如何构建更系统的设计准则，推动GenAI交互范式的革新。该研究为优化人机协作效率提供了新思路。（99字）
