# Feedforward in Generative AI: Opportunities for a Design Space

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14229v2

## 原始摘要

Generative AI (GenAI) models have become more capable than ever at augmenting
productivity and cognition across diverse contexts. However, a fundamental
challenge remains as users struggle to anticipate what AI will generate. As a
result, they must engage in excessive turn-taking with the AI's feedback to
clarify their intent, leading to significant cognitive load and time
investment. Our goal is to advance the perspective that in order for users to
seamlessly leverage the full potential of GenAI systems across various
contexts, we must design GenAI systems that not only provide informative
feedback but also informative feedforward -- designs that tell users what AI
will generate before the user submits their prompt. To spark discussion on
feedforward in GenAI, we designed diverse instantiations of feedforward across
four GenAI applications: conversational UIs, document editors, malleable
interfaces, and automation agents, and discussed how these designs can
contribute to a more rigorous investigation of a design space and a set of
guidelines for feedforward in all GenAI systems.


## AI 摘要

当前生成式AI（GenAI）虽能提升生产力，但用户难以预判其输出，导致频繁交互以澄清意图，增加认知负担和时间成本。研究提出，GenAI系统需同时提供"反馈"和"前馈"设计——即在用户提交指令前预显生成内容，才能充分发挥其潜力。团队通过对话界面、文档编辑、可塑界面和自动化代理四个应用场景，设计了多种前馈方案，旨在推动建立GenAI前馈设计的系统性研究框架和准则，优化人机协作效率。
