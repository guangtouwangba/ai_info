# Feedforward in Generative AI: Opportunities for a Design Space

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14229v2

## 原始摘要

Generative AI (GenAI) models have become more capable than ever at augmenting
productivity and cognition across diverse contexts. However, a fundamental
challenge remains as users struggle to anticipate what AI will generate. As a
result, they must engage in excessive turn-taking with the AI's feedback to
clarify their intent, leading to significant cognitive load and time
investment. Our goal is to advance the perspective that in order for users to
seamlessly leverage the full potential of GenAI systems across various
contexts, we must design GenAI systems that not only provide informative
feedback but also informative feedforward -- designs that tell users what AI
will generate before the user submits their prompt. To spark discussion on
feedforward in GenAI, we designed diverse instantiations of feedforward across
four GenAI applications: conversational UIs, document editors, malleable
interfaces, and automation agents, and discussed how these designs can
contribute to a more rigorous investigation of a design space and a set of
guidelines for feedforward in all GenAI systems.


## AI 摘要

生成式AI（GenAI）虽能提升生产力和认知能力，但用户难以预判其输出，导致需反复交互以明确意图，增加认知负担和时间成本。研究提出，GenAI系统应不仅提供反馈，还需设计"前馈"机制——在用户提交指令前展示AI的预期生成内容。通过四个应用场景（对话界面、文档编辑、可塑界面、自动化代理）的多样化设计实例，探讨了前馈机制如何优化用户体验，并为GenAI系统的设计空间和准则提供研究基础。该视角旨在帮助用户更高效地发挥GenAI潜力。
