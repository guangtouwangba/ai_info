# SRLAgent: Enhancing Self-Regulated Learning Skills through Gamification and LLM Assistance

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09968v1

## 原始摘要

Self-regulated learning (SRL) is crucial for college students navigating
increased academic demands and independence. Insufficient SRL skills can lead
to disorganized study habits, low motivation, and poor time management,
undermining learners ability to thrive in challenging environments. Through a
formative study involving 59 college students, we identified key challenges
students face in developing SRL skills, including difficulties with
goal-setting, time management, and reflective learning. To address these
challenges, we introduce SRLAgent, an LLM-assisted system that fosters SRL
skills through gamification and adaptive support from large language models
(LLMs). Grounded in Zimmermans three-phase SRL framework, SRLAgent enables
students to engage in goal-setting, strategy execution, and self-reflection
within an interactive game-based environment. The system offers real-time
feedback and scaffolding powered by LLMs to support students independent study
efforts. We evaluated SRLAgent using a between-subjects design, comparing it to
a baseline system (SRL without Agent features) and a traditional multimedia
learning condition. Results showed significant improvements in SRL skills
within the SRLAgent group (p &lt; .001, Cohens d = 0.234) and higher engagement
compared to the baselines. This work highlights the value of embedding SRL
scaffolding and real-time AI support within gamified environments, offering
design implications for educational technologies that aim to promote deeper
learning and metacognitive skill development.


## AI 摘要

研究表明，大学生缺乏自主学习(SRL)能力会导致学习效率低下。针对59名学生的调研发现，他们在目标设定、时间管理和反思学习方面存在困难。为此，研究者开发了基于大语言模型(LLM)的SRLAgent系统，通过游戏化设计和实时AI支持，帮助学生完成Zimmerman三阶段SRL循环(目标设定-策略执行-自我反思)。实验显示，使用SRLAgent的学生比对照组显著提升了SRL能力(p<0.001)且参与度更高。该研究证实了游戏化环境结合AI即时反馈对培养元认知技能的有效性，为教育技术设计提供了新思路。
