# SRLAgent: Enhancing Self-Regulated Learning Skills through Gamification and LLM Assistance

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09968v1

## 原始摘要

Self-regulated learning (SRL) is crucial for college students navigating
increased academic demands and independence. Insufficient SRL skills can lead
to disorganized study habits, low motivation, and poor time management,
undermining learners ability to thrive in challenging environments. Through a
formative study involving 59 college students, we identified key challenges
students face in developing SRL skills, including difficulties with
goal-setting, time management, and reflective learning. To address these
challenges, we introduce SRLAgent, an LLM-assisted system that fosters SRL
skills through gamification and adaptive support from large language models
(LLMs). Grounded in Zimmermans three-phase SRL framework, SRLAgent enables
students to engage in goal-setting, strategy execution, and self-reflection
within an interactive game-based environment. The system offers real-time
feedback and scaffolding powered by LLMs to support students independent study
efforts. We evaluated SRLAgent using a between-subjects design, comparing it to
a baseline system (SRL without Agent features) and a traditional multimedia
learning condition. Results showed significant improvements in SRL skills
within the SRLAgent group (p &lt; .001, Cohens d = 0.234) and higher engagement
compared to the baselines. This work highlights the value of embedding SRL
scaffolding and real-time AI support within gamified environments, offering
design implications for educational technologies that aim to promote deeper
learning and metacognitive skill development.


## AI 摘要

研究表明，大学生缺乏自主学习(SRL)能力会导致学习效率低下。针对59名学生的调研发现，他们在目标设定、时间管理和反思学习方面存在困难。为此，研究者开发了SRLAgent系统，基于Zimmerman三阶段SRL理论框架，通过游戏化和大语言模型(LLM)提供自适应支持。该系统包含目标设定、策略执行和自我反思功能，并提供实时反馈。对比实验显示，使用SRLAgent的学生在SRL能力上有显著提升(p<0.001，效应量d=0.234)，且参与度高于对照组。该研究证明了游戏化环境中嵌入AI支持的SRL框架对提升元认知技能的有效性。
