# SRLAgent: Enhancing Self-Regulated Learning Skills through Gamification and LLM Assistance

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09968v1

## 原始摘要

Self-regulated learning (SRL) is crucial for college students navigating
increased academic demands and independence. Insufficient SRL skills can lead
to disorganized study habits, low motivation, and poor time management,
undermining learners ability to thrive in challenging environments. Through a
formative study involving 59 college students, we identified key challenges
students face in developing SRL skills, including difficulties with
goal-setting, time management, and reflective learning. To address these
challenges, we introduce SRLAgent, an LLM-assisted system that fosters SRL
skills through gamification and adaptive support from large language models
(LLMs). Grounded in Zimmermans three-phase SRL framework, SRLAgent enables
students to engage in goal-setting, strategy execution, and self-reflection
within an interactive game-based environment. The system offers real-time
feedback and scaffolding powered by LLMs to support students independent study
efforts. We evaluated SRLAgent using a between-subjects design, comparing it to
a baseline system (SRL without Agent features) and a traditional multimedia
learning condition. Results showed significant improvements in SRL skills
within the SRLAgent group (p &lt; .001, Cohens d = 0.234) and higher engagement
compared to the baselines. This work highlights the value of embedding SRL
scaffolding and real-time AI support within gamified environments, offering
design implications for educational technologies that aim to promote deeper
learning and metacognitive skill development.


## AI 摘要

研究表明，大学生在自主学习（SRL）方面面临目标设定、时间管理和反思学习等核心挑战。为应对这些问题，研究者开发了SRLAgent系统，结合大型语言模型（LLM）和游戏化设计，基于Zimmerman三阶段SRL框架，提供实时反馈和适应性支持。实验对比显示，使用SRLAgent的学生在自主学习能力上有显著提升（p<0.001，效应量d=0.234），且参与度高于传统学习方式。该研究证实了游戏化环境结合AI即时支持对培养元认知技能的有效性，为教育技术设计提供了新思路。
