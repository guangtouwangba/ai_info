# How Do People Revise Inconsistent Beliefs? Examining Belief Revision in Humans with User Studies

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09977v1

## 原始摘要

Understanding how humans revise their beliefs in light of new information is
crucial for developing AI systems which can effectively model, and thus align
with, human reasoning. While theoretical belief revision frameworks rely on a
set of principles that establish how these operations are performed, empirical
evidence from cognitive psychology suggests that people may follow different
patterns when presented with conflicting information. In this paper, we present
three comprehensive user studies showing that people consistently prefer
explanation-based revisions, i.e., those which are guided by explanations, that
result in changes to their belief systems that are not necessarily captured by
classical belief change theory. Our experiments systematically investigate how
people revise their beliefs with explanations for inconsistencies, whether they
are provided with them or left to formulate them themselves, demonstrating a
robust preference for what may seem non-minimal revisions across different
types of scenarios. These findings have implications for AI systems designed to
model human reasoning or interact with humans, suggesting that such systems
should accommodate explanation-based, potentially non-minimal belief revision
operators to better align with human cognitive processes.


## AI 摘要

人类在接收新信息时倾向于基于解释的信念修正，而非经典信念修正理论所预测的最小化调整。三项用户研究表明，无论解释是由外部提供还是自行构建，人们普遍偏好通过解释来指导信念更新，即使这种修正可能显得"非最小化"。这一发现对AI系统设计具有重要启示：为了更好地模拟或配合人类推理，AI系统应采用基于解释的、可能非最小化的信念修正机制，而非仅依赖理论框架。该研究为开发更符合人类认知过程的AI系统提供了实证依据。
