# How Do People Revise Inconsistent Beliefs? Examining Belief Revision in Humans with User Studies

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09977v1

## 原始摘要

Understanding how humans revise their beliefs in light of new information is
crucial for developing AI systems which can effectively model, and thus align
with, human reasoning. While theoretical belief revision frameworks rely on a
set of principles that establish how these operations are performed, empirical
evidence from cognitive psychology suggests that people may follow different
patterns when presented with conflicting information. In this paper, we present
three comprehensive user studies showing that people consistently prefer
explanation-based revisions, i.e., those which are guided by explanations, that
result in changes to their belief systems that are not necessarily captured by
classical belief change theory. Our experiments systematically investigate how
people revise their beliefs with explanations for inconsistencies, whether they
are provided with them or left to formulate them themselves, demonstrating a
robust preference for what may seem non-minimal revisions across different
types of scenarios. These findings have implications for AI systems designed to
model human reasoning or interact with humans, suggesting that such systems
should accommodate explanation-based, potentially non-minimal belief revision
operators to better align with human cognitive processes.


## AI 摘要

人类在接收新信息时倾向于基于解释（explanation-based）而非最小化（non-minimal）的方式修正信念，这与经典信念修正理论不同。三项用户研究表明，无论解释由外部提供或自主形成，人们更偏好通过解释引导的信念调整，即使这类修正可能不符合理论上的最小化原则。这一发现对AI系统设计具有启示意义：为更好模拟人类推理或实现人机对齐，AI需支持基于解释的、非最小化的信念修正机制，以匹配人类的认知模式。研究强调了将心理学实证结果融入AI建模的重要性。
