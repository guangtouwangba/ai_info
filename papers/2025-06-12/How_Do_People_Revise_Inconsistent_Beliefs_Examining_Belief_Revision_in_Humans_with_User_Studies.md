# How Do People Revise Inconsistent Beliefs? Examining Belief Revision in Humans with User Studies

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09977v1

## 原始摘要

Understanding how humans revise their beliefs in light of new information is
crucial for developing AI systems which can effectively model, and thus align
with, human reasoning. While theoretical belief revision frameworks rely on a
set of principles that establish how these operations are performed, empirical
evidence from cognitive psychology suggests that people may follow different
patterns when presented with conflicting information. In this paper, we present
three comprehensive user studies showing that people consistently prefer
explanation-based revisions, i.e., those which are guided by explanations, that
result in changes to their belief systems that are not necessarily captured by
classical belief change theory. Our experiments systematically investigate how
people revise their beliefs with explanations for inconsistencies, whether they
are provided with them or left to formulate them themselves, demonstrating a
robust preference for what may seem non-minimal revisions across different
types of scenarios. These findings have implications for AI systems designed to
model human reasoning or interact with humans, suggesting that such systems
should accommodate explanation-based, potentially non-minimal belief revision
operators to better align with human cognitive processes.


## AI 摘要

该研究通过三项用户实验发现，人类在信念修正时更倾向于基于解释的修订方式，而非经典信念修正理论所预测的最小化调整。当面对矛盾信息时，无论解释是由外部提供还是自主形成，人们普遍会选择看似非最小化的信念调整路径。这一发现对AI系统设计具有重要启示：为了更好模拟人类推理并与人类认知过程对齐，AI系统需要采用支持解释驱动的、可能非最小化的信念修正机制。研究强调了将心理学实证发现纳入AI建模的必要性，以提升人机交互的自然性和有效性。
