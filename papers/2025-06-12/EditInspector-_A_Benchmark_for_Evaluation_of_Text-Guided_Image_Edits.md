# EditInspector: A Benchmark for Evaluation of Text-Guided Image Edits

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09988v1

## 原始摘要

Text-guided image editing, fueled by recent advancements in generative AI, is
becoming increasingly widespread. This trend highlights the need for a
comprehensive framework to verify text-guided edits and assess their quality.
To address this need, we introduce EditInspector, a novel benchmark for
evaluation of text-guided image edits, based on human annotations collected
using an extensive template for edit verification. We leverage EditInspector to
evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art (SoTA) vision and language models
in assessing edits across various dimensions, including accuracy, artifact
detection, visual quality, seamless integration with the image scene, adherence
to common sense, and the ability to describe edit-induced changes. Our findings
indicate that current models struggle to evaluate edits comprehensively and
frequently hallucinate when describing the changes. To address these
challenges, we propose two novel methods that outperform SoTA models in both
artifact detection and difference caption generation.


## AI 摘要

随着生成式AI推动文本引导图像编辑的普及，研究者提出了EditInspector基准框架，通过人工标注模板系统评估编辑质量。该研究测试了前沿视觉语言模型在准确性、伪影检测、视觉质量等维度的表现，发现现有模型存在评估不全面和描述失真问题。为此，团队提出了两种新方法，在伪影检测和差异描述生成方面均优于现有技术。研究揭示了当前AI在图像编辑评估中的局限性，并为质量验证提供了改进方向。（99字）
