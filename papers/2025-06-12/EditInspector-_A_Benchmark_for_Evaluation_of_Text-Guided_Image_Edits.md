# EditInspector: A Benchmark for Evaluation of Text-Guided Image Edits

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09988v1

## 原始摘要

Text-guided image editing, fueled by recent advancements in generative AI, is
becoming increasingly widespread. This trend highlights the need for a
comprehensive framework to verify text-guided edits and assess their quality.
To address this need, we introduce EditInspector, a novel benchmark for
evaluation of text-guided image edits, based on human annotations collected
using an extensive template for edit verification. We leverage EditInspector to
evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art (SoTA) vision and language models
in assessing edits across various dimensions, including accuracy, artifact
detection, visual quality, seamless integration with the image scene, adherence
to common sense, and the ability to describe edit-induced changes. Our findings
indicate that current models struggle to evaluate edits comprehensively and
frequently hallucinate when describing the changes. To address these
challenges, we propose two novel methods that outperform SoTA models in both
artifact detection and difference caption generation.


## AI 摘要

随着生成式AI推动文本引导图像编辑的普及，研究者提出了EditInspector评估框架，通过人工标注验证编辑质量。该基准测试从准确性、伪影检测、视觉质量等维度评估了前沿视觉语言模型的表现，发现现有模型在全面评估编辑效果时存在困难，且容易产生幻觉描述。为此，研究团队提出两种新方法，在伪影检测和差异描述生成任务上均优于当前最优模型。这项工作为文本引导编辑的标准化评估提供了重要基准，并揭示了现有技术的局限性。（99字）
