# EditInspector: A Benchmark for Evaluation of Text-Guided Image Edits

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09988v1

## 原始摘要

Text-guided image editing, fueled by recent advancements in generative AI, is
becoming increasingly widespread. This trend highlights the need for a
comprehensive framework to verify text-guided edits and assess their quality.
To address this need, we introduce EditInspector, a novel benchmark for
evaluation of text-guided image edits, based on human annotations collected
using an extensive template for edit verification. We leverage EditInspector to
evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art (SoTA) vision and language models
in assessing edits across various dimensions, including accuracy, artifact
detection, visual quality, seamless integration with the image scene, adherence
to common sense, and the ability to describe edit-induced changes. Our findings
indicate that current models struggle to evaluate edits comprehensively and
frequently hallucinate when describing the changes. To address these
challenges, we propose two novel methods that outperform SoTA models in both
artifact detection and difference caption generation.


## AI 摘要

本文介绍了EditInspector，一个基于人工标注的文本引导图像编辑评估基准，用于全面验证编辑质量。研究利用该基准评估了当前最先进的视觉语言模型在准确性、伪影检测、视觉质量、场景融合度、常识符合度及编辑描述能力等维度的表现，发现现有模型存在评估不全面和描述幻觉问题。为此，作者提出了两种新方法，在伪影检测和差异描述生成任务上均优于现有最优模型。该研究为生成式AI驱动的图像编辑提供了系统化的质量评估框架。
