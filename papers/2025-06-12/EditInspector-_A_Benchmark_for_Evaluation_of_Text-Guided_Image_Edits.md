# EditInspector: A Benchmark for Evaluation of Text-Guided Image Edits

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09988v1

## 原始摘要

Text-guided image editing, fueled by recent advancements in generative AI, is
becoming increasingly widespread. This trend highlights the need for a
comprehensive framework to verify text-guided edits and assess their quality.
To address this need, we introduce EditInspector, a novel benchmark for
evaluation of text-guided image edits, based on human annotations collected
using an extensive template for edit verification. We leverage EditInspector to
evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art (SoTA) vision and language models
in assessing edits across various dimensions, including accuracy, artifact
detection, visual quality, seamless integration with the image scene, adherence
to common sense, and the ability to describe edit-induced changes. Our findings
indicate that current models struggle to evaluate edits comprehensively and
frequently hallucinate when describing the changes. To address these
challenges, we propose two novel methods that outperform SoTA models in both
artifact detection and difference caption generation.


## AI 摘要

随着生成式AI的发展，文本引导的图像编辑技术日益普及，亟需系统化的评估框架。为此，研究者提出了EditInspector基准，基于人工标注的编辑验证模板，从准确性、伪影检测、视觉质量、场景融合度、常识符合度及编辑描述能力等维度评估当前最先进的视觉语言模型。研究发现，现有模型在全面评估编辑效果时表现不佳，且容易产生幻觉描述。针对这些问题，研究团队提出了两种新方法，在伪影检测和差异描述生成任务上超越了现有最优模型。
