# An Empirically Grounded Identifiability Theory Will Accelerate Self-Supervised Learning Research

## 原始摘要

Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) powers many current AI systems. As research
interest and investment grow, the SSL design space continues to expand. The
Platonic view of SSL, following the Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH),
suggests that despite different methods and engineering approaches, all
representations converge to the same Platonic ideal. However, this phenomenon
lacks precise theoretical explanation. By synthesizing evidence from
Identifiability Theory (IT), we show that the PRH can emerge in SSL. However,
current IT cannot explain SSL's empirical success. To bridge the gap between
theory and practice, we propose expanding IT into what we term Singular
Identifiability Theory (SITh), a broader theoretical framework encompassing the
entire SSL pipeline. SITh would allow deeper insights into the implicit data
assumptions in SSL and advance the field towards learning more interpretable
and generalizable representations. We highlight three critical directions for
future research: 1) training dynamics and convergence properties of SSL; 2) the
impact of finite samples, batch size, and data diversity; and 3) the role of
inductive biases in architecture, augmentations, initialization schemes, and
optimizers.


## AI 摘要

当前自监督学习(SSL)研究快速发展，但缺乏理论解释。研究发现，基于可辨识性理论(IT)，柏拉图表示假说(PRH)可能在SSL中成立，但现有IT无法解释SSL的实际成功。为此，作者提出扩展IT为"奇异可辨识性理论"(SITh)，构建涵盖整个SSL流程的理论框架，以深入理解数据假设，推动学习更具解释性和泛化性的表示。未来研究应关注三个方向：1)SSL训练动态与收敛特性；2)有限样本、批量和数据多样性的影响；3)架构、增强、初始化和优化器中归纳偏置的作用。
