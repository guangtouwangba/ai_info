# Object-Driven Narrative in AR: A Scenario-Metaphor Framework with VLM Integration

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13119v1

## 原始摘要

Most adaptive AR storytelling systems define environmental semantics using
simple object labels and spatial coordinates, limiting narratives to rigid,
pre-defined logic. This oversimplification overlooks the contextual
significance of object relationships-for example, a wedding ring on a
nightstand might suggest marital conflict, yet is treated as just "two objects"
in space. To address this, we explored integrating Vision Language Models
(VLMs) into AR pipelines. However, several challenges emerged: First, stories
generated with simple prompt guidance lacked narrative depth and spatial usage.
Second, spatial semantics were underutilized, failing to support meaningful
storytelling. Third, pre-generated scripts struggled to align with AR
Foundation's object naming and coordinate systems. We propose a scene-driven AR
storytelling framework that reimagines environments as active narrative agents,
built on three innovations: 1. State-aware object semantics: We decompose
object meaning into physical, functional, and metaphorical layers, allowing
VLMs to distinguish subtle narrative cues between similar objects. 2.
Structured narrative interface: A bidirectional JSON layer maps VLM-generated
metaphors to AR anchors, maintaining spatial and semantic coherence. 3. STAM
evaluation framework: A three-part experimental design evaluates narrative
quality, highlighting both strengths and limitations of VLM-AR integration. Our
findings show that the system can generate stories from the environment itself,
not just place them on top of it. In user studies, 70% of participants reported
seeing real-world objects differently when narratives were grounded in
environmental symbolism. By merging VLMs' generative creativity with AR's
spatial precision, this framework introduces a novel object-driven storytelling
paradigm, transforming passive spaces into active narrative landscapes.


## AI 摘要

现有AR叙事系统常将环境语义简化为物体标签和空间坐标，导致叙事缺乏深度。本研究提出基于视觉语言模型(VLM)的场景驱动AR叙事框架，通过三层创新：1) 将物体语义分解为物理、功能和隐喻层面；2) 设计双向JSON接口连接VLM隐喻与AR锚点；3) 建立STAM评估体系。实验表明，该系统能从环境中生成故事(而非简单叠加)，70%用户反馈环境物体因隐喻叙事获得新意义。该框架融合VLM的创造性与AR的空间精度，实现了"物体驱动"的叙事范式，使被动空间转变为主动叙事载体。
