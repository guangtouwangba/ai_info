# Contextual Agent Security: A Policy for Every Purpose

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17070v3

## 原始摘要

Judging an action's safety requires knowledge of the context in which the
action takes place. To human agents who act in various contexts, this may seem
obvious: performing an action such as email deletion may or may not be
appropriate depending on the email's content, the goal (e.g., to erase
sensitive emails or to clean up trash), and the type of email address (e.g.,
work or personal). Unlike people, computational systems have often had only
limited agency in limited contexts. Thus, manually crafted policies and user
confirmation (e.g., smartphone app permissions or network access control
lists), while imperfect, have sufficed to restrict harmful actions. However,
with the upcoming deployment of generalist agents that support a multitude of
tasks (e.g., an automated personal assistant), we argue that we must rethink
security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these
systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain
of agents and proposes contextual agent security (Conseca), a framework to
generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.


## AI 摘要

该论文探讨了在通用智能代理（如自动化个人助手）时代重新思考安全设计的必要性。传统基于手动策略和用户确认的方法（如应用权限控制）在有限场景下有效，但无法适应多任务代理的复杂情境需求。作者提出"情境代理安全"框架Conseca，旨在生成即时、情境相关且人类可验证的安全策略。该方案通过分析动作执行的具体上下文（如删除邮件时的内容、目的和邮箱类型）来判断安全性，从而解决通用代理在多样化场景中面临的安全挑战，为下一代智能系统安全设计迈出重要一步。（99字）
