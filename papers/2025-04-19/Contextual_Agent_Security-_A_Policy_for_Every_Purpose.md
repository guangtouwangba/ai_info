# Contextual Agent Security: A Policy for Every Purpose

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17070v3

## 原始摘要

Judging an action's safety requires knowledge of the context in which the
action takes place. To human agents who act in various contexts, this may seem
obvious: performing an action such as email deletion may or may not be
appropriate depending on the email's content, the goal (e.g., to erase
sensitive emails or to clean up trash), and the type of email address (e.g.,
work or personal). Unlike people, computational systems have often had only
limited agency in limited contexts. Thus, manually crafted policies and user
confirmation (e.g., smartphone app permissions or network access control
lists), while imperfect, have sufficed to restrict harmful actions. However,
with the upcoming deployment of generalist agents that support a multitude of
tasks (e.g., an automated personal assistant), we argue that we must rethink
security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these
systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain
of agents and proposes contextual agent security (Conseca), a framework to
generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.


## AI 摘要

判断一个行为的安全性需要结合具体情境。对人类而言，这显而易见（如删除邮件是否合适取决于邮件内容、目的和邮箱类型），但计算系统通常只在有限情境中运行，依赖手动策略和用户确认（如应用权限）。然而，随着通用智能代理（如自动助手）的发展，其多任务能力要求安全设计适应更复杂的情境。本文提出"情境化代理安全"框架Conseca，能够生成即时、情境相关且可人工验证的安全策略，为这一挑战提供初步解决方案。（99字）  

注：摘要核心聚焦于通用智能代理带来的安全范式转变及Conseca框架的创新性，在保持原意基础上精简了技术细节和举例说明。
