# Contextual Agent Security: A Policy for Every Purpose

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17070v3

## 原始摘要

Judging an action's safety requires knowledge of the context in which the
action takes place. To human agents who act in various contexts, this may seem
obvious: performing an action such as email deletion may or may not be
appropriate depending on the email's content, the goal (e.g., to erase
sensitive emails or to clean up trash), and the type of email address (e.g.,
work or personal). Unlike people, computational systems have often had only
limited agency in limited contexts. Thus, manually crafted policies and user
confirmation (e.g., smartphone app permissions or network access control
lists), while imperfect, have sufficed to restrict harmful actions. However,
with the upcoming deployment of generalist agents that support a multitude of
tasks (e.g., an automated personal assistant), we argue that we must rethink
security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these
systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain
of agents and proposes contextual agent security (Conseca), a framework to
generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了在通用智能代理（如自动化个人助手）日益普及的背景下，传统基于手动策略和用户确认的安全机制已无法满足需求。作者提出"情境化代理安全"（Conseca）框架，旨在根据具体情境动态生成即时、可验证的安全策略。研究表明，行动的安全性高度依赖上下文（如邮件删除操作需考虑内容、目的和账户类型），而现有计算系统缺乏人类的多情境适应能力。该研究为开发适应大规模多任务代理的安全设计迈出了第一步，强调需要重新思考安全机制以适应智能代理的广泛能力和多样化使用场景。
