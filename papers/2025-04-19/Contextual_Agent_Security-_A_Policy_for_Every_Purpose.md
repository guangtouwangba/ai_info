# Contextual Agent Security: A Policy for Every Purpose

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17070v3

## 原始摘要

Judging an action's safety requires knowledge of the context in which the
action takes place. To human agents who act in various contexts, this may seem
obvious: performing an action such as email deletion may or may not be
appropriate depending on the email's content, the goal (e.g., to erase
sensitive emails or to clean up trash), and the type of email address (e.g.,
work or personal). Unlike people, computational systems have often had only
limited agency in limited contexts. Thus, manually crafted policies and user
confirmation (e.g., smartphone app permissions or network access control
lists), while imperfect, have sufficed to restrict harmful actions. However,
with the upcoming deployment of generalist agents that support a multitude of
tasks (e.g., an automated personal assistant), we argue that we must rethink
security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these
systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain
of agents and proposes contextual agent security (Conseca), a framework to
generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.


## AI 摘要

判断一个行为是否安全需要结合具体情境。人类在不同情境下能自然调整行为标准（如删除邮件是否合适取决于邮件内容、目的和邮箱类型），但传统计算系统只能在有限情境中运行，依靠预设策略和用户确认来防范风险。随着通用智能代理（如自动化个人助手）的出现，其多任务能力和广泛情境使得现有安全机制难以应对。为此，本研究提出"情境化代理安全框架"（Conseca），旨在生成即时、情境相关且可供人类验证的安全策略，以适应新一代智能系统的复杂需求。这是探索代理情境化安全的首步尝试。
