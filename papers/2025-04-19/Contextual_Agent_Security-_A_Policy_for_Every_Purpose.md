# Contextual Agent Security: A Policy for Every Purpose

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17070v3

## 原始摘要

Judging an action's safety requires knowledge of the context in which the
action takes place. To human agents who act in various contexts, this may seem
obvious: performing an action such as email deletion may or may not be
appropriate depending on the email's content, the goal (e.g., to erase
sensitive emails or to clean up trash), and the type of email address (e.g.,
work or personal). Unlike people, computational systems have often had only
limited agency in limited contexts. Thus, manually crafted policies and user
confirmation (e.g., smartphone app permissions or network access control
lists), while imperfect, have sufficed to restrict harmful actions. However,
with the upcoming deployment of generalist agents that support a multitude of
tasks (e.g., an automated personal assistant), we argue that we must rethink
security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these
systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain
of agents and proposes contextual agent security (Conseca), a framework to
generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文探讨了在通用智能代理(如自动化个人助手)时代需要重新思考安全设计。作者指出，传统基于手动策略和用户确认的安全机制(如手机应用权限)已无法适应多任务代理的复杂情境需求。为此，他们提出了Conseca框架，能够生成即时、情境相关且人类可验证的安全策略。该研究聚焦代理领域的情境安全问题，强调行动的安全性取决于具体情境(如删除邮件的行为是否恰当需考虑邮件内容、目的和账户类型等因素)，而现有计算系统在这方面存在局限。
