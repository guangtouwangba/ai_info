# Contextual Agent Security: A Policy for Every Purpose

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17070v3

## 原始摘要

Judging an action's safety requires knowledge of the context in which the
action takes place. To human agents who act in various contexts, this may seem
obvious: performing an action such as email deletion may or may not be
appropriate depending on the email's content, the goal (e.g., to erase
sensitive emails or to clean up trash), and the type of email address (e.g.,
work or personal). Unlike people, computational systems have often had only
limited agency in limited contexts. Thus, manually crafted policies and user
confirmation (e.g., smartphone app permissions or network access control
lists), while imperfect, have sufficed to restrict harmful actions. However,
with the upcoming deployment of generalist agents that support a multitude of
tasks (e.g., an automated personal assistant), we argue that we must rethink
security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these
systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain
of agents and proposes contextual agent security (Conseca), a framework to
generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.


## AI 摘要

评估一个行为的安全性需要考虑其发生的具体情境。对人类而言，这显而易见（如删除邮件是否恰当取决于邮件内容、目的和邮箱类型）。传统计算系统因功能有限，依靠手动设置权限策略即可防范风险。但随着多功能智能代理（如自动个人助手）的出现，其广泛的应用场景要求重新设计安全机制。为此，本文提出Conseca框架，旨在生成即时、情境化且可人工验证的安全策略，以应对通用智能代理带来的规模化安全挑战。该研究聚焦情境化代理安全领域，为新型系统的安全设计提供初步解决方案。（99字）
