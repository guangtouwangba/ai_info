# Contextual Agent Security: A Policy for Every Purpose

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17070v3

## 原始摘要

Judging an action's safety requires knowledge of the context in which the
action takes place. To human agents who act in various contexts, this may seem
obvious: performing an action such as email deletion may or may not be
appropriate depending on the email's content, the goal (e.g., to erase
sensitive emails or to clean up trash), and the type of email address (e.g.,
work or personal). Unlike people, computational systems have often had only
limited agency in limited contexts. Thus, manually crafted policies and user
confirmation (e.g., smartphone app permissions or network access control
lists), while imperfect, have sufficed to restrict harmful actions. However,
with the upcoming deployment of generalist agents that support a multitude of
tasks (e.g., an automated personal assistant), we argue that we must rethink
security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these
systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain
of agents and proposes contextual agent security (Conseca), a framework to
generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了在通用智能代理时代如何确保行动安全的问题。传统计算系统依赖手动制定的策略和用户确认来限制有害行为，但随着多功能代理（如自动化个人助手）的出现，其广泛的任务和情境使得现有安全设计面临挑战。作者提出"情境代理安全"（Conseca）框架，旨在生成即时、情境相关且可人工验证的安全策略。该框架强调根据具体情境（如电子邮件内容、操作目的等）动态评估行为安全性，以应对通用代理在多任务环境中的安全需求，为下一代智能系统的安全设计提供了新思路。
