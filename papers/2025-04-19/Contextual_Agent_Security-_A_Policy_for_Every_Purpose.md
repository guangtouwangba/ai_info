# Contextual Agent Security: A Policy for Every Purpose

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17070v3

## 原始摘要

Judging an action's safety requires knowledge of the context in which the
action takes place. To human agents who act in various contexts, this may seem
obvious: performing an action such as email deletion may or may not be
appropriate depending on the email's content, the goal (e.g., to erase
sensitive emails or to clean up trash), and the type of email address (e.g.,
work or personal). Unlike people, computational systems have often had only
limited agency in limited contexts. Thus, manually crafted policies and user
confirmation (e.g., smartphone app permissions or network access control
lists), while imperfect, have sufficed to restrict harmful actions. However,
with the upcoming deployment of generalist agents that support a multitude of
tasks (e.g., an automated personal assistant), we argue that we must rethink
security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these
systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain
of agents and proposes contextual agent security (Conseca), a framework to
generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了在通用智能代理（如自动化个人助手）时代重新思考安全设计的必要性。传统基于手动策略和用户确认的安全机制（如应用权限）已无法适应多任务代理的复杂场景需求。作者提出"上下文代理安全"（Conseca）框架，能够根据具体情境（如操作内容、目标、环境等）动态生成即时、可验证的安全策略。以删除邮件为例，该行为是否安全需结合邮件内容、操作目的（清理垃圾或删除敏感邮件）及邮箱类型（工作或个人）等上下文综合判断。该研究为智能代理的上下文安全策略提供了新思路。
