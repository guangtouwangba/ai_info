# Contextual Agent Security: A Policy for Every Purpose

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17070v3

## 原始摘要

Judging an action's safety requires knowledge of the context in which the
action takes place. To human agents who act in various contexts, this may seem
obvious: performing an action such as email deletion may or may not be
appropriate depending on the email's content, the goal (e.g., to erase
sensitive emails or to clean up trash), and the type of email address (e.g.,
work or personal). Unlike people, computational systems have often had only
limited agency in limited contexts. Thus, manually crafted policies and user
confirmation (e.g., smartphone app permissions or network access control
lists), while imperfect, have sufficed to restrict harmful actions. However,
with the upcoming deployment of generalist agents that support a multitude of
tasks (e.g., an automated personal assistant), we argue that we must rethink
security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these
systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain
of agents and proposes contextual agent security (Conseca), a framework to
generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了在通用智能代理（如自动化个人助手）时代，传统基于手动策略和用户确认的安全设计已无法适应多样化场景的需求。作者提出"情境代理安全"（Conseca）框架，通过即时生成可验证的情境化安全策略来解决这一问题。该框架能根据具体情境（如邮件内容、操作目的、账户类型等）动态判断行为安全性，突破了当前计算系统在有限场景下的局限性，为通用代理的大规模部署提供了更灵活的安全保障方案。这一研究标志着安全设计从静态规则向动态情境感知的重要转变。
