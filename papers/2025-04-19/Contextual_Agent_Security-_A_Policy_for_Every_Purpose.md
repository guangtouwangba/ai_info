# Contextual Agent Security: A Policy for Every Purpose

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17070v3

## 原始摘要

Judging an action's safety requires knowledge of the context in which the
action takes place. To human agents who act in various contexts, this may seem
obvious: performing an action such as email deletion may or may not be
appropriate depending on the email's content, the goal (e.g., to erase
sensitive emails or to clean up trash), and the type of email address (e.g.,
work or personal). Unlike people, computational systems have often had only
limited agency in limited contexts. Thus, manually crafted policies and user
confirmation (e.g., smartphone app permissions or network access control
lists), while imperfect, have sufficed to restrict harmful actions. However,
with the upcoming deployment of generalist agents that support a multitude of
tasks (e.g., an automated personal assistant), we argue that we must rethink
security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these
systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain
of agents and proposes contextual agent security (Conseca), a framework to
generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了智能代理在不同情境下的安全性问题。人类可以根据上下文判断行为是否安全（如删除邮件的合理性取决于内容、目的和邮箱类型），但现有计算系统通常只能在有限情境中运作，依赖手动制定的策略和用户确认（如应用权限控制）。随着多功能通用代理（如自动化个人助手）的出现，作者提出需要重新设计适应大规模情境的安全框架。为此，论文提出Conseca框架，能够生成即时、情境化且可人工验证的安全策略，以应对通用代理在多任务环境中的安全挑战。
