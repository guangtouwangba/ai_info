# Contextual Agent Security: A Policy for Every Purpose

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17070v3

## 原始摘要

Judging an action's safety requires knowledge of the context in which the
action takes place. To human agents who act in various contexts, this may seem
obvious: performing an action such as email deletion may or may not be
appropriate depending on the email's content, the goal (e.g., to erase
sensitive emails or to clean up trash), and the type of email address (e.g.,
work or personal). Unlike people, computational systems have often had only
limited agency in limited contexts. Thus, manually crafted policies and user
confirmation (e.g., smartphone app permissions or network access control
lists), while imperfect, have sufficed to restrict harmful actions. However,
with the upcoming deployment of generalist agents that support a multitude of
tasks (e.g., an automated personal assistant), we argue that we must rethink
security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these
systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain
of agents and proposes contextual agent security (Conseca), a framework to
generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.


## AI 摘要

评估一个行为的安全性需要结合具体情境。对人类而言，这显而易见，比如删除邮件是否恰当取决于邮件内容、目的（如删除敏感信息或清理垃圾）和邮箱类型（工作或个人）。但计算系统通常只在有限情境下运行，依靠手动设置策略和用户确认（如应用权限）即可防范风险。然而，随着多功能智能代理（如自动个人助手）的出现，其广泛任务和情境要求重新设计安全机制。为此，本文提出Conseca框架，旨在生成即时、情境化且可人工验证的安全策略，为智能代理的上下文安全提供解决方案。（100字）
