# Contextual Agent Security: A Policy for Every Purpose

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17070v3

## 原始摘要

Judging an action's safety requires knowledge of the context in which the
action takes place. To human agents who act in various contexts, this may seem
obvious: performing an action such as email deletion may or may not be
appropriate depending on the email's content, the goal (e.g., to erase
sensitive emails or to clean up trash), and the type of email address (e.g.,
work or personal). Unlike people, computational systems have often had only
limited agency in limited contexts. Thus, manually crafted policies and user
confirmation (e.g., smartphone app permissions or network access control
lists), while imperfect, have sufficed to restrict harmful actions. However,
with the upcoming deployment of generalist agents that support a multitude of
tasks (e.g., an automated personal assistant), we argue that we must rethink
security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these
systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain
of agents and proposes contextual agent security (Conseca), a framework to
generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了在通用智能代理（如自动化个人助手）日益普及的背景下，如何重新设计安全框架以适应多任务场景。传统基于手动策略和用户确认的安全机制（如应用权限控制）已无法满足需求。研究提出Conseca框架，旨在生成即时、情境化且可人工验证的安全策略。该方案强调行动安全性需结合具体情境（如邮件删除操作需考虑内容、目的和账户类型），为智能代理系统提供动态安全防护。这一创新为多任务代理系统的安全设计提供了新思路，填补了现有安全机制在复杂场景下的不足。
