# Contextual Agent Security: A Policy for Every Purpose

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17070v3

## 原始摘要

Judging an action's safety requires knowledge of the context in which the
action takes place. To human agents who act in various contexts, this may seem
obvious: performing an action such as email deletion may or may not be
appropriate depending on the email's content, the goal (e.g., to erase
sensitive emails or to clean up trash), and the type of email address (e.g.,
work or personal). Unlike people, computational systems have often had only
limited agency in limited contexts. Thus, manually crafted policies and user
confirmation (e.g., smartphone app permissions or network access control
lists), while imperfect, have sufficed to restrict harmful actions. However,
with the upcoming deployment of generalist agents that support a multitude of
tasks (e.g., an automated personal assistant), we argue that we must rethink
security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these
systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain
of agents and proposes contextual agent security (Conseca), a framework to
generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了智能代理在不同情境下的安全性问题。人类可以基于上下文判断行为安全性（如删除邮件是否恰当），但传统计算系统因功能有限，主要依靠预设策略和用户确认来防范风险。随着多功能通用代理（如自动个人助手）的出现，现有安全设计已无法适应其广泛的应用场景。为此，作者提出"情境化代理安全"框架（Conseca），旨在生成即时、情境化且可人工验证的安全策略。该研究是探索智能代理情境安全的第一步，强调需要重新设计安全机制以适应新一代系统的多任务处理能力和复杂应用场景。
