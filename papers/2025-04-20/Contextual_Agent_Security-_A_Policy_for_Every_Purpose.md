# Contextual Agent Security: A Policy for Every Purpose

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17070v3

## 原始摘要

Judging an action's safety requires knowledge of the context in which the
action takes place. To human agents who act in various contexts, this may seem
obvious: performing an action such as email deletion may or may not be
appropriate depending on the email's content, the goal (e.g., to erase
sensitive emails or to clean up trash), and the type of email address (e.g.,
work or personal). Unlike people, computational systems have often had only
limited agency in limited contexts. Thus, manually crafted policies and user
confirmation (e.g., smartphone app permissions or network access control
lists), while imperfect, have sufficed to restrict harmful actions. However,
with the upcoming deployment of generalist agents that support a multitude of
tasks (e.g., an automated personal assistant), we argue that we must rethink
security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these
systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain
of agents and proposes contextual agent security (Conseca), a framework to
generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.


## AI 摘要

判断一个行为的安全性需要考虑其发生的具体情境。对人类而言，这显而易见（如删除邮件是否恰当取决于邮件内容、目的和邮箱类型），但计算系统通常只能在有限情境中运作，依赖手动制定的策略和用户确认（如应用权限控制）。然而，随着多功能智能代理（如自动化个人助手）的出现，其广泛的任务执行能力要求安全设计适应多样化的情境。为此，本文提出"情境化代理安全框架"（Conseca），旨在生成即时、情境相关且可人工验证的安全策略，为这一新兴领域迈出探索性一步。（99字）
