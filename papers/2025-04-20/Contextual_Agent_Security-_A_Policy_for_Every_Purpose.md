# Contextual Agent Security: A Policy for Every Purpose

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17070v3

## 原始摘要

Judging an action's safety requires knowledge of the context in which the
action takes place. To human agents who act in various contexts, this may seem
obvious: performing an action such as email deletion may or may not be
appropriate depending on the email's content, the goal (e.g., to erase
sensitive emails or to clean up trash), and the type of email address (e.g.,
work or personal). Unlike people, computational systems have often had only
limited agency in limited contexts. Thus, manually crafted policies and user
confirmation (e.g., smartphone app permissions or network access control
lists), while imperfect, have sufficed to restrict harmful actions. However,
with the upcoming deployment of generalist agents that support a multitude of
tasks (e.g., an automated personal assistant), we argue that we must rethink
security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these
systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain
of agents and proposes contextual agent security (Conseca), a framework to
generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了在通用智能代理（如自动化个人助手）日益普及的背景下，传统的基于手动策略和用户确认的安全设计已无法适应多样化情境的需求。作者提出"情境代理安全"（Conseca）框架，能够根据具体情境（如操作内容、目标和环境）动态生成即时、可验证的安全策略。该研究强调，与人类不同，计算系统需要新的安全机制来评估诸如删除邮件等操作的安全性，因为这类操作是否恰当取决于多重情境因素。Conseca旨在为具有广泛任务能力的智能代理提供更灵活、可扩展的安全保障方案。
