# Contextual Agent Security: A Policy for Every Purpose

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17070v3

## 原始摘要

Judging an action's safety requires knowledge of the context in which the
action takes place. To human agents who act in various contexts, this may seem
obvious: performing an action such as email deletion may or may not be
appropriate depending on the email's content, the goal (e.g., to erase
sensitive emails or to clean up trash), and the type of email address (e.g.,
work or personal). Unlike people, computational systems have often had only
limited agency in limited contexts. Thus, manually crafted policies and user
confirmation (e.g., smartphone app permissions or network access control
lists), while imperfect, have sufficed to restrict harmful actions. However,
with the upcoming deployment of generalist agents that support a multitude of
tasks (e.g., an automated personal assistant), we argue that we must rethink
security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these
systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain
of agents and proposes contextual agent security (Conseca), a framework to
generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了智能代理在多样化情境中的安全问题，提出需要重新设计安全机制以适应通用代理的多任务能力。传统基于人工策略和用户确认的方法（如应用权限控制）已不足以应对通用代理（如自动个人助手）的复杂情境。作者提出Conseca框架，能生成即时、情境化且可人工验证的安全策略。该方案强调动作安全性取决于具体情境（如删除工作邮件与垃圾邮件的差异），旨在为具有广泛能力的智能系统建立动态安全防护机制，是迈向情境化代理安全的重要一步。（99字）
