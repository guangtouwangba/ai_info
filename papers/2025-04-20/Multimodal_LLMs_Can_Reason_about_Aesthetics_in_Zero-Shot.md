# Multimodal LLMs Can Reason about Aesthetics in Zero-Shot

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09012v2

## 原始摘要

The rapid progress of generative art has democratized the creation of
visually pleasing imagery. However, achieving genuine artistic impact - the
kind that resonates with viewers on a deeper, more meaningful level - requires
a sophisticated aesthetic sensibility. This sensibility involves a
multi-faceted reasoning process extending beyond mere visual appeal, which is
often overlooked by current computational models. This paper pioneers an
approach to capture this complex process by investigating how the reasoning
capabilities of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) can be effectively elicited for
aesthetic judgment. Our analysis reveals a critical challenge: MLLMs exhibit a
tendency towards hallucinations during aesthetic reasoning, characterized by
subjective opinions and unsubstantiated artistic interpretations. We further
demonstrate that these limitations can be overcome by employing an
evidence-based, objective reasoning process, as substantiated by our proposed
baseline, ArtCoT. MLLMs prompted by this principle produce multi-faceted and
in-depth aesthetic reasoning that aligns significantly better with human
judgment. These findings have direct applications in areas such as AI art
tutoring and as reward models for generative art. Ultimately, our work paves
the way for AI systems that can truly understand, appreciate, and generate
artworks that align with the sensible human aesthetic standard.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文探讨了如何利用多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)进行美学判断，以提升生成艺术的质量。研究发现当前MLLMs在美学推理时容易产生主观臆断和未经证实的艺术解读。作者提出的ArtCoT基线方法通过基于证据的客观推理过程，显著改善了这一问题，使MLLMs能产生更全面深入的美学分析，更符合人类审美标准。这项研究在AI艺术辅导和生成艺术奖励模型方面具有直接应用价值，为开发能真正理解、欣赏并创作符合人类审美标准的AI系统奠定了基础。
