# Multimodal LLMs Can Reason about Aesthetics in Zero-Shot

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09012v2

## 原始摘要

The rapid progress of generative art has democratized the creation of
visually pleasing imagery. However, achieving genuine artistic impact - the
kind that resonates with viewers on a deeper, more meaningful level - requires
a sophisticated aesthetic sensibility. This sensibility involves a
multi-faceted reasoning process extending beyond mere visual appeal, which is
often overlooked by current computational models. This paper pioneers an
approach to capture this complex process by investigating how the reasoning
capabilities of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) can be effectively elicited for
aesthetic judgment. Our analysis reveals a critical challenge: MLLMs exhibit a
tendency towards hallucinations during aesthetic reasoning, characterized by
subjective opinions and unsubstantiated artistic interpretations. We further
demonstrate that these limitations can be overcome by employing an
evidence-based, objective reasoning process, as substantiated by our proposed
baseline, ArtCoT. MLLMs prompted by this principle produce multi-faceted and
in-depth aesthetic reasoning that aligns significantly better with human
judgment. These findings have direct applications in areas such as AI art
tutoring and as reward models for generative art. Ultimately, our work paves
the way for AI systems that can truly understand, appreciate, and generate
artworks that align with the sensible human aesthetic standard.


## AI 摘要

当前生成艺术快速发展，但AI模型常忽略超越视觉吸引力的深层美学判断。本文研究发现，多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在美学推理中易产生主观臆断的"幻觉"。通过提出基于证据的客观推理框架ArtCoT，成功使MLLMs产生更符合人类评判的多维度深度美学分析。这一突破可应用于AI艺术辅导和生成艺术奖励模型，推动AI系统真正理解、欣赏并创作符合人类审美标准的艺术作品。研究揭示了克服AI美学判断局限性的关键路径，为开发具有高级审美能力的AI系统奠定了基础。（99字）
