# Multimodal LLMs Can Reason about Aesthetics in Zero-Shot

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09012v2

## 原始摘要

The rapid progress of generative art has democratized the creation of
visually pleasing imagery. However, achieving genuine artistic impact - the
kind that resonates with viewers on a deeper, more meaningful level - requires
a sophisticated aesthetic sensibility. This sensibility involves a
multi-faceted reasoning process extending beyond mere visual appeal, which is
often overlooked by current computational models. This paper pioneers an
approach to capture this complex process by investigating how the reasoning
capabilities of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) can be effectively elicited for
aesthetic judgment. Our analysis reveals a critical challenge: MLLMs exhibit a
tendency towards hallucinations during aesthetic reasoning, characterized by
subjective opinions and unsubstantiated artistic interpretations. We further
demonstrate that these limitations can be overcome by employing an
evidence-based, objective reasoning process, as substantiated by our proposed
baseline, ArtCoT. MLLMs prompted by this principle produce multi-faceted and
in-depth aesthetic reasoning that aligns significantly better with human
judgment. These findings have direct applications in areas such as AI art
tutoring and as reward models for generative art. Ultimately, our work paves
the way for AI systems that can truly understand, appreciate, and generate
artworks that align with the sensible human aesthetic standard.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文探讨了如何利用多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)进行更深入的美学判断。研究发现，当前MLLMs在美学推理中存在"幻觉"问题，容易产生主观意见和未经证实的艺术解读。作者提出的ArtCoT基线方法通过基于证据的客观推理过程，有效克服了这一局限，使MLLMs能产生更全面深入的美学分析，显著提升了与人类审美判断的一致性。这一成果可应用于AI艺术辅导和生成艺术的奖励模型，为开发真正理解、欣赏和创造符合人类审美标准的AI系统奠定了基础。研究揭示了计算美学中客观推理的重要性。
