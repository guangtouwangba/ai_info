# An Empirically Grounded Identifiability Theory Will Accelerate Self-Supervised Learning Research

## 原始摘要

Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) powers many current AI systems. As research
interest and investment grow, the SSL design space continues to expand. The
Platonic view of SSL, following the Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH),
suggests that despite different methods and engineering approaches, all
representations converge to the same Platonic ideal. However, this phenomenon
lacks precise theoretical explanation. By synthesizing evidence from
Identifiability Theory (IT), we show that the PRH can emerge in SSL. However,
current IT cannot explain SSL's empirical success. To bridge the gap between
theory and practice, we propose expanding IT into what we term Singular
Identifiability Theory (SITh), a broader theoretical framework encompassing the
entire SSL pipeline. SITh would allow deeper insights into the implicit data
assumptions in SSL and advance the field towards learning more interpretable
and generalizable representations. We highlight three critical directions for
future research: 1) training dynamics and convergence properties of SSL; 2) the
impact of finite samples, batch size, and data diversity; and 3) the role of
inductive biases in architecture, augmentations, initialization schemes, and
optimizers.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了自监督学习(SSL)中的柏拉图表征假说(PRH)，即不同SSL方法最终会收敛到相同的理想表征。研究通过可辨识性理论(IT)证明PRH可能成立，但现有理论无法完全解释SSL的成功实践。为此，作者提出"奇异可辨识性理论"(SITh)作为更全面的理论框架，以深入理解SSL中的隐含数据假设。研究指出三个关键未来方向：1)SSL训练动态与收敛特性；2)有限样本、批量和数据多样性的影响；3)架构、数据增强、初始化和优化器中的归纳偏置作用。该工作旨在推动学习更具解释性和泛化性的表征。
