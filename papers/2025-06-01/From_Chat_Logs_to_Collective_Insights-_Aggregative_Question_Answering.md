# From Chat Logs to Collective Insights: Aggregative Question Answering

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23765v1

## 原始摘要

Conversational agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are rapidly
becoming integral to our daily interactions, generating unprecedented amounts
of conversational data. Such datasets offer a powerful lens into societal
interests, trending topics, and collective concerns. Yet, existing approaches
typically treat these interactions as independent and miss critical insights
that could emerge from aggregating and reasoning across large-scale
conversation logs. In this paper, we introduce Aggregative Question Answering,
a novel task requiring models to reason explicitly over thousands of
user-chatbot interactions to answer aggregative queries, such as identifying
emerging concerns among specific demographics. To enable research in this
direction, we construct a benchmark, WildChat-AQA, comprising 6,027 aggregative
questions derived from 182,330 real-world chatbot conversations. Experiments
show that existing methods either struggle to reason effectively or incur
prohibitive computational costs, underscoring the need for new approaches
capable of extracting collective insights from large-scale conversational data.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种新任务——聚合问答(Aggregative Question Answering)，要求模型从大规模用户-聊天机器人对话中提取集体洞察，以回答聚合查询（如识别特定人群的关注点）。研究构建了包含6,027个聚合问题的WildChat-AQA基准数据集，源自182,330条真实对话。实验表明现有方法在有效推理或计算成本方面存在不足，凸显了开发新方法以从海量对话数据中获取社会洞察的必要性。该研究为利用对话数据理解社会趋势提供了新视角。
