# COBRA: Contextual Bandit Algorithm for Ensuring Truthful Strategic Agents

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23720v1

## 原始摘要

This paper considers a contextual bandit problem involving multiple agents,
where a learner sequentially observes the contexts and the agent's reported
arms, and then selects the arm that maximizes the system's overall reward.
Existing work in contextual bandits assumes that agents truthfully report their
arms, which is unrealistic in many real-life applications. For instance,
consider an online platform with multiple sellers; some sellers may
misrepresent product quality to gain an advantage, such as having the platform
preferentially recommend their products to online users. To address this
challenge, we propose an algorithm, COBRA, for contextual bandit problems
involving strategic agents that disincentivize their strategic behavior without
using any monetary incentives, while having incentive compatibility and a
sub-linear regret guarantee. Our experimental results also validate the
different performance aspects of our proposed algorithm.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种针对多智能体情境下战略行为的上下文赌博机算法COBRA。传统方法假设智能体会如实报告选择，但现实中（如电商平台卖家可能虚报产品质量以获取推荐优势），这种假设不成立。COBRA无需货币激励即可抑制智能体的战略行为，同时保证激励相容性和次线性遗憾界。实验验证了算法的各项性能优势。该研究解决了战略行为对系统整体奖励最大化的干扰问题，适用于存在信息操纵风险的实际应用场景。
