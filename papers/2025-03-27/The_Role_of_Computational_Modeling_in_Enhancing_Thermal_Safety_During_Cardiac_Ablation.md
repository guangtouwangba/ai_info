**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20751v1

## 原始摘要

Objective: In this review, we aim to provide an analysis of current cardiac
ablation techniques, such as radiofrequency ablation (RF), cryoablation, and
pulsed-field ablation (PFA), with a focus on the role of computational modeling
in enhancing the precision, safety, and effectiveness of these treatments.
Particular attention is given to thermal management, exploring how
computational approaches contribute to understanding and controlling energy
delivery, heat distribution, and tissue response during ablation procedures.
Methods: The mechanisms, applications, and limitations of radiofrequency (RF)
ablation, cryoablation, and pulsed field ablation (PFA) are reviewed.
Additionally, the use of computational approaches, including numerical methods
and artificial intelligence (AI)-based models, for evaluating energy
distribution, lesion size, and tissue response during ablation procedures is
discussed. Results: Computational methods can predict ablation treatment
outcomes and help optimize lesion size, ablation parameters, and procedural
safety. However, these models are only reliable when properly validated and
verified. Conclusion: Further research is essential to collect reliable in vivo
data for validating computational models and integrating them into clinical
practice to improve patient outcomes.


## AI 摘要

这篇综述分析了射频消融(RF)、冷冻消融和脉冲电场消融(PFA)等心脏消融技术，重点探讨计算模型在提高治疗精准度、安全性和有效性方面的作用。研究比较了各种消融技术的机制、应用和局限性，并评估了数值计算和人工智能模型在预测能量分布、病灶大小和组织反应方面的应用。结果表明，计算模型能有效预测消融效果并优化治疗参数，但其可靠性依赖于充分的验证。未来需要更多可靠的体内实验数据来验证这些模型，以推动其临床应用并改善患者预后。
