**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20751v1

## 原始摘要

Objective: In this review, we aim to provide an analysis of current cardiac
ablation techniques, such as radiofrequency ablation (RF), cryoablation, and
pulsed-field ablation (PFA), with a focus on the role of computational modeling
in enhancing the precision, safety, and effectiveness of these treatments.
Particular attention is given to thermal management, exploring how
computational approaches contribute to understanding and controlling energy
delivery, heat distribution, and tissue response during ablation procedures.
Methods: The mechanisms, applications, and limitations of radiofrequency (RF)
ablation, cryoablation, and pulsed field ablation (PFA) are reviewed.
Additionally, the use of computational approaches, including numerical methods
and artificial intelligence (AI)-based models, for evaluating energy
distribution, lesion size, and tissue response during ablation procedures is
discussed. Results: Computational methods can predict ablation treatment
outcomes and help optimize lesion size, ablation parameters, and procedural
safety. However, these models are only reliable when properly validated and
verified. Conclusion: Further research is essential to collect reliable in vivo
data for validating computational models and integrating them into clinical
practice to improve patient outcomes.


## AI 摘要

本文综述了射频消融、冷冻消融和脉冲电场消融等心脏消融技术，重点探讨计算模型在提升治疗精度、安全性和有效性中的作用。通过分析能量传递、热分布和组织反应的计算模拟方法（包括数值模型和AI模型），研究发现计算模型能预测消融效果、优化病灶大小和手术参数，但其可靠性依赖于充分验证。作者强调未来需获取更多可靠的体内实验数据来验证模型，并将其整合到临床实践中以改善治疗效果。计算建模为消融技术的优化提供了重要工具，但需进一步研究验证其临床应用价值。
