**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20751v1

## 原始摘要

Objective: In this review, we aim to provide an analysis of current cardiac
ablation techniques, such as radiofrequency ablation (RF), cryoablation, and
pulsed-field ablation (PFA), with a focus on the role of computational modeling
in enhancing the precision, safety, and effectiveness of these treatments.
Particular attention is given to thermal management, exploring how
computational approaches contribute to understanding and controlling energy
delivery, heat distribution, and tissue response during ablation procedures.
Methods: The mechanisms, applications, and limitations of radiofrequency (RF)
ablation, cryoablation, and pulsed field ablation (PFA) are reviewed.
Additionally, the use of computational approaches, including numerical methods
and artificial intelligence (AI)-based models, for evaluating energy
distribution, lesion size, and tissue response during ablation procedures is
discussed. Results: Computational methods can predict ablation treatment
outcomes and help optimize lesion size, ablation parameters, and procedural
safety. However, these models are only reliable when properly validated and
verified. Conclusion: Further research is essential to collect reliable in vivo
data for validating computational models and integrating them into clinical
practice to improve patient outcomes.
