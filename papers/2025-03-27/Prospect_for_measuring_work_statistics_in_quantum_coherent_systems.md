# Prospect for measuring work statistics in quantum coherent systems

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20729v1

## 原始摘要

Quantum thermodynamics is concerned with heat and work exchange between a
quantum coherent system and heat reservoirs or work agents. In stochastic
thermodynamcis a key object of interest is the statistics of these quantities,
but it is notoriously difficult to measure it in general systems. Here we
discuss the prospect for measuring work statistics in electronic devices, via a
study of a transmon-microcavity system. The microwave cavity acts as a work
agent, exchanging work with the transmon. We formulate a protocol to measure
the first moments of work $\langle W^n \rangle$ via photon number detection. We
find conditions for capturing quantum coherence in the work statistics.
Interestingly, by measuring higher moments one can verify the Jarzynski
equality $\langle e^{-W/T} \rangle = 1$ including quantum interference. Our
work opens a way for measuring work statistics in nontrivial quantum systems.


## AI 摘要

本文研究了量子热力学中电子器件（transmon-微腔系统）的功统计测量方法。通过微波腔作为功源与transmon交换功，提出了基于光子数检测的功矩〈W^n〉测量方案，并确定了捕捉功统计中量子相干性的条件。研究发现，通过测量高阶矩可验证包含量子干涉项的Jarzynski等式〈e^(-W/T)〉=1。该工作为复杂量子系统中的功统计测量开辟了新途径。
