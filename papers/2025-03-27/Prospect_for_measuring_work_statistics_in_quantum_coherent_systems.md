# Prospect for measuring work statistics in quantum coherent systems

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20729v1

## 原始摘要

Quantum thermodynamics is concerned with heat and work exchange between a
quantum coherent system and heat reservoirs or work agents. In stochastic
thermodynamcis a key object of interest is the statistics of these quantities,
but it is notoriously difficult to measure it in general systems. Here we
discuss the prospect for measuring work statistics in electronic devices, via a
study of a transmon-microcavity system. The microwave cavity acts as a work
agent, exchanging work with the transmon. We formulate a protocol to measure
the first moments of work $\langle W^n \rangle$ via photon number detection. We
find conditions for capturing quantum coherence in the work statistics.
Interestingly, by measuring higher moments one can verify the Jarzynski
equality $\langle e^{-W/T} \rangle = 1$ including quantum interference. Our
work opens a way for measuring work statistics in nontrivial quantum systems.

本文探讨了在电子器件中测量功统计量的方法，重点研究了transmon-微腔系统。微波腔作为功源与transmon交换功，提出通过光子数检测测量功的各阶矩⟨Wⁿ⟩的方案。研究发现特定条件下可捕捉功统计中的量子相干性，且通过高阶矩测量可验证包含量子干涉项的Jarzynski等式⟨e⁻ᵂ⁄ᵀ⟩=1。该工作为复杂量子系统中功统计测量提供了新途径。
