# Prospect for measuring work statistics in quantum coherent systems

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20729v1

## 原始摘要

Quantum thermodynamics is concerned with heat and work exchange between a
quantum coherent system and heat reservoirs or work agents. In stochastic
thermodynamcis a key object of interest is the statistics of these quantities,
but it is notoriously difficult to measure it in general systems. Here we
discuss the prospect for measuring work statistics in electronic devices, via a
study of a transmon-microcavity system. The microwave cavity acts as a work
agent, exchanging work with the transmon. We formulate a protocol to measure
the first moments of work $\langle W^n \rangle$ via photon number detection. We
find conditions for capturing quantum coherence in the work statistics.
Interestingly, by measuring higher moments one can verify the Jarzynski
equality $\langle e^{-W/T} \rangle = 1$ including quantum interference. Our
work opens a way for measuring work statistics in nontrivial quantum systems.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了在量子热力学中测量电子器件功统计的方法，重点研究了transmon-微腔系统。微波腔作为功源与transmon交换功，提出通过光子数检测测量功的矩〈Wⁿ〉的方案。研究确定了捕捉功统计中量子相干性的条件，并发现通过测量高阶矩可以验证包含量子干涉的Jarzynski等式〈e^(-W/T)〉=1。该工作为测量复杂量子系统的功统计开辟了新途径。
