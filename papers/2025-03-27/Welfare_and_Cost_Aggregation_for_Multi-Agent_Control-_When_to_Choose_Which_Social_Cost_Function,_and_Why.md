# Welfare and Cost Aggregation for Multi-Agent Control: When to Choose Which Social Cost Function, and Why?

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20772v1

## 原始摘要

Many multi-agent socio-technical systems rely on aggregating heterogeneous
agents' costs into a social cost function (SCF) to coordinate resource
allocation in domains like energy grids, water allocation, or traffic
management. The choice of SCF often entails implicit assumptions and may lead
to undesirable outcomes if not rigorously justified. In this paper, we
demonstrate that what determines which SCF ought to be used is the degree to
which individual costs can be compared across agents and which axioms the
aggregation shall fulfill. Drawing on the results from social choice theory, we
provide guidance on how this process can be used in control applications. We
demonstrate which assumptions about interpersonal utility comparability --
ranging from ordinal level comparability to full cardinal comparability --
together with a choice of desirable axioms, inform the selection of a correct
SCF, be it the classical utilitarian sum, the Nash SCF, or maximin. We then
demonstrate how the proposed framework can be applied for principled
allocations of water and transportation resources.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了多智能体社会技术系统中社会成本函数(SCF)的选择问题。研究表明，SCF的选择取决于个体成本的可比程度以及需要满足的公理条件。基于社会选择理论，作者提出了一个框架，通过分析效用可比性假设(从序数级别到完全基数可比性)和公理选择，指导SCF的合理选用，如经典功利总和、纳什SCF或最大化最小值等。该框架可应用于水资源分配和交通管理等实际场景，确保资源分配的合理性。研究强调了SCF选择需要严格论证，避免隐含假设导致不良后果。
