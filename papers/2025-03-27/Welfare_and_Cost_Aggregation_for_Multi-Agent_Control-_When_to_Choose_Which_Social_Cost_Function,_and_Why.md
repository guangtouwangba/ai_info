# Welfare and Cost Aggregation for Multi-Agent Control: When to Choose Which Social Cost Function, and Why?

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20772v1

## 原始摘要

Many multi-agent socio-technical systems rely on aggregating heterogeneous
agents' costs into a social cost function (SCF) to coordinate resource
allocation in domains like energy grids, water allocation, or traffic
management. The choice of SCF often entails implicit assumptions and may lead
to undesirable outcomes if not rigorously justified. In this paper, we
demonstrate that what determines which SCF ought to be used is the degree to
which individual costs can be compared across agents and which axioms the
aggregation shall fulfill. Drawing on the results from social choice theory, we
provide guidance on how this process can be used in control applications. We
demonstrate which assumptions about interpersonal utility comparability --
ranging from ordinal level comparability to full cardinal comparability --
together with a choice of desirable axioms, inform the selection of a correct
SCF, be it the classical utilitarian sum, the Nash SCF, or maximin. We then
demonstrate how the proposed framework can be applied for principled
allocations of water and transportation resources.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了在多智能体社会技术系统中，如何通过社会成本函数（SCF）协调资源分配。研究表明，SCF的选择取决于个体成本的可比性（如序数或基数可比性）以及所满足的公理。基于社会选择理论，作者提出了SCF选择的指导框架，指出不同假设（如完全基数可比性）和公理要求会导向不同的SCF形式（如功利总和、纳什SCF或最大化最小值）。最后，该框架被应用于水资源和交通资源的分配实践，为相关决策提供了理论依据。
