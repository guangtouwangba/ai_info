# Welfare and Cost Aggregation for Multi-Agent Control: When to Choose Which Social Cost Function, and Why?

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20772v1

## 原始摘要

Many multi-agent socio-technical systems rely on aggregating heterogeneous
agents' costs into a social cost function (SCF) to coordinate resource
allocation in domains like energy grids, water allocation, or traffic
management. The choice of SCF often entails implicit assumptions and may lead
to undesirable outcomes if not rigorously justified. In this paper, we
demonstrate that what determines which SCF ought to be used is the degree to
which individual costs can be compared across agents and which axioms the
aggregation shall fulfill. Drawing on the results from social choice theory, we
provide guidance on how this process can be used in control applications. We
demonstrate which assumptions about interpersonal utility comparability --
ranging from ordinal level comparability to full cardinal comparability --
together with a choice of desirable axioms, inform the selection of a correct
SCF, be it the classical utilitarian sum, the Nash SCF, or maximin. We then
demonstrate how the proposed framework can be applied for principled
allocations of water and transportation resources.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了多智能体社会技术系统中社会成本函数(SCF)的选择问题。研究表明，SCF的选择取决于个体成本的可比程度以及需要满足的公理条件。基于社会选择理论，研究分析了从序数级到完全基数可比性等不同假设下应采用的SCF形式，如经典功利总和、纳什SCF或最大最小化方法。研究还展示了该框架在水资源和交通分配中的实际应用价值，为控制应用中的资源分配提供了理论依据。研究强调了严格论证SCF选择的重要性，以避免因隐含假设导致的不良后果。
