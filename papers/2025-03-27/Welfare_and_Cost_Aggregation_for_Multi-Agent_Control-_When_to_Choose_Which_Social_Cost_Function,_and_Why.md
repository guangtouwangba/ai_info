# Welfare and Cost Aggregation for Multi-Agent Control: When to Choose Which Social Cost Function, and Why?

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20772v1

## 原始摘要

Many multi-agent socio-technical systems rely on aggregating heterogeneous
agents' costs into a social cost function (SCF) to coordinate resource
allocation in domains like energy grids, water allocation, or traffic
management. The choice of SCF often entails implicit assumptions and may lead
to undesirable outcomes if not rigorously justified. In this paper, we
demonstrate that what determines which SCF ought to be used is the degree to
which individual costs can be compared across agents and which axioms the
aggregation shall fulfill. Drawing on the results from social choice theory, we
provide guidance on how this process can be used in control applications. We
demonstrate which assumptions about interpersonal utility comparability --
ranging from ordinal level comparability to full cardinal comparability --
together with a choice of desirable axioms, inform the selection of a correct
SCF, be it the classical utilitarian sum, the Nash SCF, or maximin. We then
demonstrate how the proposed framework can be applied for principled
allocations of water and transportation resources.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了多智能体社会技术系统中社会成本函数（SCF）的选择问题。研究表明，SCF的合理性取决于个体成本的可比性程度（从序数到完全基数可比性）以及所满足的公理条件。基于社会选择理论，作者提出了指导原则，说明不同假设（如效用可比性水平）与公理选择如何共同决定SCF的适用形式（如功利总和、纳什SCF或最大化最小值）。研究还通过水资源和交通资源分配的实例，展示了该框架在控制应用中的实践价值，强调了严格论证SCF选择对避免不良结果的重要性。
