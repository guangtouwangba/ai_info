# A Multi-Agent Framework Integrating Large Language Models and Generative AI for Accelerated Metamaterial Design

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19889v1

## 原始摘要

Metamaterials, renowned for their exceptional mechanical, electromagnetic,
and thermal properties, hold transformative potential across diverse
applications, yet their design remains constrained by labor-intensive
trial-and-error methods and limited data interoperability. Here, we introduce
CrossMatAgent--a novel multi-agent framework that synergistically integrates
large language models with state-of-the-art generative AI to revolutionize
metamaterial design. By orchestrating a hierarchical team of agents--each
specializing in tasks such as pattern analysis, architectural synthesis, prompt
engineering, and supervisory feedback--our system leverages the multimodal
reasoning of GPT-4o alongside the generative precision of DALL-E 3 and a
fine-tuned Stable Diffusion XL model. This integrated approach automates data
augmentation, enhances design fidelity, and produces simulation- and 3D
printing-ready metamaterial patterns. Comprehensive evaluations, including
CLIP-based alignment, SHAP interpretability analyses, and mechanical
simulations under varied load conditions, demonstrate the framework's ability
to generate diverse, reproducible, and application-ready designs. CrossMatAgent
thus establishes a scalable, AI-driven paradigm that bridges the gap between
conceptual innovation and practical realization, paving the way for accelerated
metamaterial development.
