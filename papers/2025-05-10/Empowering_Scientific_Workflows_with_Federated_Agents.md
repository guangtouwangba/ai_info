# Empowering Scientific Workflows with Federated Agents

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05428v1

## 原始摘要

Agentic systems, in which diverse agents cooperate to tackle challenging
problems, are exploding in popularity in the AI community. However, the agentic
frameworks used to build these systems have not previously enabled use with
research cyberinfrastructure. Here we introduce Academy, a modular and
extensible middleware designed to deploy autonomous agents across the federated
research ecosystem, including HPC systems, experimental facilities, and data
repositories. To meet the demands of scientific computing, Academy supports
asynchronous execution, heterogeneous resources, high-throughput data flows,
and dynamic resource availability. It provides abstractions for expressing
stateful agents, managing inter-agent coordination, and integrating computation
with experimental control. We present microbenchmark results that demonstrate
high performance and scalability in HPC environments. To demonstrate the
breadth of applications that can be supported by agentic workflow designs, we
also present case studies in materials discovery, decentralized learning, and
information extraction in which agents are deployed across diverse HPC systems.
