# clem:todd: A Framework for the Systematic Benchmarking of LLM-Based Task-Oriented Dialogue System Realisations

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05445v1

## 原始摘要

The emergence of instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) has advanced
the field of dialogue systems, enabling both realistic user simulations and
robust multi-turn conversational agents. However, existing research often
evaluates these components in isolation-either focusing on a single user
simulator or a specific system design-limiting the generalisability of insights
across architectures and configurations. In this work, we propose clem todd
(chat-optimized LLMs for task-oriented dialogue systems development), a
flexible framework for systematically evaluating dialogue systems under
consistent conditions. clem todd enables detailed benchmarking across
combinations of user simulators and dialogue systems, whether existing models
from literature or newly developed ones. It supports plug-and-play integration
and ensures uniform datasets, evaluation metrics, and computational
constraints. We showcase clem todd's flexibility by re-evaluating existing
task-oriented dialogue systems within this unified setup and integrating three
newly proposed dialogue systems into the same evaluation pipeline. Our results
provide actionable insights into how architecture, scale, and prompting
strategies affect dialogue performance, offering practical guidance for
building efficient and effective conversational AI systems.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了clem todd框架，用于在统一条件下系统评估任务导向对话系统。该框架支持灵活集成现有的或新开发的用户模拟器和对话系统，确保数据集、评估指标和计算约束的一致性。通过重新评估现有系统并整合三个新系统，研究揭示了架构、规模和提示策略对对话性能的影响，为构建高效对话AI提供了实用指导。clem todd的模块化设计促进了对话系统组件的标准化对比，克服了以往研究孤立评估的局限性，提升了不同配置间的可推广性。
