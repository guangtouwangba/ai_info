# Robustly optimal dynamics for active matter reservoir computing

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05420v1

## 原始摘要

We study the information processing abilities of active matter in the
reservoir computing (RC) paradigm, using a model that is externally driven to
infer the future state of a chaotic signal. The simulated system closely
follows a previously reported model. We uncover an exceptional dynamical regime
of agent dynamics that has been overlooked heretofore. It appears robustly
optimal across varying physical parameters and inference tasks, thus providing
valuable insights into computation and inference with physical systems more
generally. The ability to form effective mechanisms for information processing
are primarily determined by the system's own intrinsic relaxation abilities.
These are identifiable when probing the system without a specific inference
goal and manifest when testing minimalistic single-particle reservoirs. The
regime that achieves optimal computation is situated just below the critical
damping threshold, involving a microscopic dynamical relaxation with multiple
stages. The optimal system is adaptable under chaotic external driving, due to
a diversity in response mechanisms that emerge like rapid alternations between
quasi-stationary and highly nonlinear dynamical states. Both coherent and
incoherent dynamics contribute to their operation, partly at dissimilar scales
of space and delay time. Correlations on agent dynamics can indicate the
best-performing regimes and onsets of tight relationships between the
responding system and the fluctuating driver. As this model of computation is
interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding
learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body
physics out of equilibrium.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了活性物质在储层计算（RC）范式中的信息处理能力，通过模拟外部驱动的混沌信号预测模型，发现了一个此前被忽视的优异动力学机制。这一机制在多种物理参数和推断任务中均表现出稳健的最优性，其核心在于系统固有的多阶段弛豫能力。最优计算状态位于临界阻尼阈值以下，表现为准稳态与高度非线性动态的快速交替响应。相干与非相干动力学共同作用，且不同时空尺度的动态相关性可标识最优性能区间。该物理可解释模型为平衡态多体物理的非传统计算提供了新思路。
