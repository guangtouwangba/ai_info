# MultiMind: Enhancing Werewolf Agents with Multimodal Reasoning and Theory of Mind

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18039v2

## 原始摘要

Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities
in social deduction games (SDGs) like Werewolf, where strategic reasoning and
social deception are essential. However, current approaches remain limited to
textual information, ignoring crucial multimodal cues such as facial
expressions and tone of voice that humans naturally use to communicate.
Moreover, existing SDG agents primarily focus on inferring other players'
identities without modeling how others perceive themselves or fellow players.
To address these limitations, we use One Night Ultimate Werewolf (ONUW) as a
testbed and present MultiMind, the first framework integrating multimodal
information into SDG agents. MultiMind processes facial expressions and vocal
tones alongside verbal content, while employing a Theory of Mind (ToM) model to
represent each player's suspicion levels toward others. By combining this ToM
model with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), our agent identifies communication
strategies that minimize suspicion directed at itself. Through comprehensive
evaluation in both agent-versus-agent simulations and studies with human
players, we demonstrate MultiMind's superior performance in gameplay. Our work
presents a significant advancement toward LLM agents capable of human-like
social reasoning across multimodal domains.


## AI 摘要

本研究提出MultiMind框架，首次将多模态信息整合到社交推理游戏（如《一夜终极狼人杀》）的AI代理中。该框架通过分析面部表情、语音语调等非语言线索，结合心理理论(ToM)模型追踪玩家间的相互怀疑程度，并利用蒙特卡洛树搜索(MCTS)优化沟通策略。实验表明，MultiMind在AI对战和人类玩家测试中均表现出色，显著提升了AI在复杂社交场景中的推理能力。这一突破使大语言模型代理能够更接近人类的多模态社交推理水平，为开发具备跨模态社交能力的AI系统提供了重要进展。（99字）
