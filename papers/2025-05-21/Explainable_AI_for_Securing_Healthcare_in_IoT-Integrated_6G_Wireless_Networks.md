# Explainable AI for Securing Healthcare in IoT-Integrated 6G Wireless Networks

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14659v1

## 原始摘要

As healthcare systems increasingly adopt advanced wireless networks and
connected devices, securing medical applications has become critical. The
integration of Internet of Medical Things devices, such as robotic surgical
tools, intensive care systems, and wearable monitors has enhanced patient care
but introduced serious security risks. Cyberattacks on these devices can lead
to life threatening consequences, including surgical errors, equipment failure,
and data breaches. While the ITU IMT 2030 vision highlights 6G's transformative
role in healthcare through AI and cloud integration, it also raises new
security concerns. This paper explores how explainable AI techniques like SHAP,
LIME, and DiCE can uncover vulnerabilities, strengthen defenses, and improve
trust and transparency in 6G enabled healthcare. We support our approach with
experimental analysis and highlight promising results.


## AI 摘要

随着医疗系统广泛采用无线网络和联网设备，医疗应用的安全问题日益突出。物联网医疗设备（如手术机器人、重症监护系统和可穿戴监测仪）的普及提升了医疗水平，但也带来了严重的安全风险。针对这些设备的网络攻击可能导致手术失误、设备故障和数据泄露等危及生命的后果。虽然ITU IMT 2030展望了6G通过AI和云计算变革医疗的潜力，但也引发了新的安全隐患。本文探讨了SHAP、LIME和DiCE等可解释AI技术如何发现漏洞、增强防御，并提升6G医疗系统的透明度和可信度，实验分析验证了该方法的有效性。
