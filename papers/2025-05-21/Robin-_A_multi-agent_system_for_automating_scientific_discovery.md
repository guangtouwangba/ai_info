# Robin: A multi-agent system for automating scientific discovery

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13400v1

## 原始摘要

Scientific discovery is driven by the iterative process of background
research, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and data analysis. Despite
recent advancements in applying artificial intelligence to scientific
discovery, no system has yet automated all of these stages in a single
workflow. Here, we introduce Robin, the first multi-agent system capable of
fully automating the key intellectual steps of the scientific process. By
integrating literature search agents with data analysis agents, Robin can
generate hypotheses, propose experiments, interpret experimental results, and
generate updated hypotheses, achieving a semi-autonomous approach to scientific
discovery. By applying this system, we were able to identify a novel treatment
for dry age-related macular degeneration (dAMD), the major cause of blindness
in the developed world. Robin proposed enhancing retinal pigment epithelium
phagocytosis as a therapeutic strategy, and identified and validated a
promising therapeutic candidate, ripasudil. Ripasudil is a clinically-used rho
kinase (ROCK) inhibitor that has never previously been proposed for treating
dAMD. To elucidate the mechanism of ripasudil-induced upregulation of
phagocytosis, Robin then proposed and analyzed a follow-up RNA-seq experiment,
which revealed upregulation of ABCA1, a critical lipid efflux pump and possible
novel target. All hypotheses, experimental plans, data analyses, and data
figures in the main text of this report were produced by Robin. As the first AI
system to autonomously discover and validate a novel therapeutic candidate
within an iterative lab-in-the-loop framework, Robin establishes a new paradigm
for AI-driven scientific discovery.


## AI 摘要

研究人员开发了首个能全流程自动化科学发现的多智能体系统Robin。该系统整合文献检索与数据分析功能，可自主完成假设生成、实验设计、结果解读和假设更新等科研关键步骤。应用该系统，研究者发现了一种治疗干性年龄相关性黄斑变性(dAMD)的新疗法。Robin提出通过增强视网膜色素上皮细胞吞噬功能来治疗dAMD，并鉴定出临床已有药物瑞帕舒地(ripasudil)作为潜在治疗候选药物。后续RNA测序实验发现该药物通过上调ABCA1基因发挥作用。所有研究假设、实验设计和数据分析均由Robin自主完成，开创了AI驱动科研的新范式。
