# BizChat: Scaffolding AI-Powered Business Planning for Small Business Owners Across Digital Skill Levels

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08493v2

## 原始摘要

Generative AI can help small business owners automate tasks, increase
efficiency, and improve their bottom line. However, despite the seemingly
intuitive design of systems like ChatGPT, significant barriers remain for those
less comfortable with technology. To address these disparities, prior work
highlights accessory skills -- beyond prompt engineering -- users must master
to successfully adopt generative AI including keyboard shortcuts, editing
skills, file conversions, and browser literacy. Building on a design workshop
series and 15 interviews with small businesses, we introduce BizChat, a large
language model (LLM)-powered web application that helps business owners across
digital skills levels write their business plan -- an essential but often
neglected document. To do so, BizChat's interface embodies three design
considerations inspired by learning sciences: ensuring accessibility to users
with less digital skills while maintaining extensibility to power users
("low-floor-high-ceiling"), providing in situ micro-learning to support
entrepreneurial education ("just-in-time learning"), and framing interaction
around business activities ("contextualized technology introduction"). We
conclude with plans for a future BizChat deployment.


## AI 摘要

生成式AI能帮助小企业主自动化任务、提高效率并改善收益，但技术门槛仍是主要障碍。研究表明，用户需掌握键盘快捷键、编辑技能等辅助技能才能有效使用AI工具。基于设计研讨会和15家小企业访谈，研究者开发了BizChat——一个基于大语言模型的网页应用，帮助不同数字技能水平的用户撰写商业计划书。该工具采用三项设计原则：低门槛高上限（兼顾新手和高级用户）、即时微学习（嵌入式创业教育）和业务场景化交互（情境化技术引入）。未来计划将进一步部署该应用。
