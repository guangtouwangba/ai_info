# BizChat: Scaffolding AI-Powered Business Planning for Small Business Owners Across Digital Skill Levels

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08493v2

## 原始摘要

Generative AI can help small business owners automate tasks, increase
efficiency, and improve their bottom line. However, despite the seemingly
intuitive design of systems like ChatGPT, significant barriers remain for those
less comfortable with technology. To address these disparities, prior work
highlights accessory skills -- beyond prompt engineering -- users must master
to successfully adopt generative AI including keyboard shortcuts, editing
skills, file conversions, and browser literacy. Building on a design workshop
series and 15 interviews with small businesses, we introduce BizChat, a large
language model (LLM)-powered web application that helps business owners across
digital skills levels write their business plan -- an essential but often
neglected document. To do so, BizChat's interface embodies three design
considerations inspired by learning sciences: ensuring accessibility to users
with less digital skills while maintaining extensibility to power users
("low-floor-high-ceiling"), providing in situ micro-learning to support
entrepreneurial education ("just-in-time learning"), and framing interaction
around business activities ("contextualized technology introduction"). We
conclude with plans for a future BizChat deployment.


## AI 摘要

生成式AI能帮助小企业主自动化任务、提高效率并改善收益，但技术门槛仍是主要障碍。研究发现，除提示工程外，用户还需掌握键盘快捷键、编辑技能等辅助技能。为此，研究者开发了BizChat——基于大语言模型的网页应用，帮助不同数字技能水平的用户撰写商业计划书。其设计融合了三大原则：兼顾低门槛与高扩展性（低地板高天花板）、提供即时微学习支持（适时学习）、围绕商业场景设计交互（情境化技术引入）。该研究通过设计研讨会和15次访谈验证方案，并计划未来部署应用。
