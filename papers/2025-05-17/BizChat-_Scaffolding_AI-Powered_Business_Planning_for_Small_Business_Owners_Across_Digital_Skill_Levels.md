# BizChat: Scaffolding AI-Powered Business Planning for Small Business Owners Across Digital Skill Levels

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08493v2

## 原始摘要

Generative AI can help small business owners automate tasks, increase
efficiency, and improve their bottom line. However, despite the seemingly
intuitive design of systems like ChatGPT, significant barriers remain for those
less comfortable with technology. To address these disparities, prior work
highlights accessory skills -- beyond prompt engineering -- users must master
to successfully adopt generative AI including keyboard shortcuts, editing
skills, file conversions, and browser literacy. Building on a design workshop
series and 15 interviews with small businesses, we introduce BizChat, a large
language model (LLM)-powered web application that helps business owners across
digital skills levels write their business plan -- an essential but often
neglected document. To do so, BizChat's interface embodies three design
considerations inspired by learning sciences: ensuring accessibility to users
with less digital skills while maintaining extensibility to power users
("low-floor-high-ceiling"), providing in situ micro-learning to support
entrepreneurial education ("just-in-time learning"), and framing interaction
around business activities ("contextualized technology introduction"). We
conclude with plans for a future BizChat deployment.


## AI 摘要

生成式AI虽能帮助小企业主自动化任务、提升效率，但技术门槛仍是主要障碍。研究指出，用户需掌握快捷键、文件转换等辅助技能才能有效使用AI工具。基于设计研讨会和15家小企业访谈，研究者开发了LLM驱动的BizChat网页应用，通过低门槛高扩展性界面、即时微学习和业务场景化交互设计，帮助不同数字技能水平的用户撰写商业计划书。该工具融合了学习科学理念，未来计划进一步部署应用。（99字）  

注：摘要保留了核心要素——问题背景（技术门槛）、解决方案（BizChat）、关键设计原则（低门槛高扩展/即时学习/场景化）及未来方向，同时满足字数限制。
