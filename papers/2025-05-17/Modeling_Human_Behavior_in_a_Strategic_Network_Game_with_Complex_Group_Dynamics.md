# Modeling Human Behavior in a Strategic Network Game with Complex Group Dynamics

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03795v2

## 原始摘要

Human networks greatly impact important societal outcomes, including wealth
and health inequality, poverty, and bullying. As such, understanding human
networks is critical to learning how to promote favorable societal outcomes. As
a step toward better understanding human networks, we compare and contrast
several methods for learning, from a small data set, models of human behavior
in a strategic network game called the Junior High Game (JHG). These modeling
methods differ with respect to the assumptions they use to parameterize human
behavior (behavior vs. community-aware behavior) and the moments they model
(mean vs. distribution). Results show that the highest-performing method,
called hCAB, models the distribution of human behavior rather than the mean and
assumes humans use community-aware behavior rather than behavior matching. When
applied to small societies (6-11 individuals), the hCAB model closely mirrors
the population dynamics of human groups (with notable differences).
Additionally, in a user study, human participants were unable to distinguish
individual hCAB agents from other humans, thus illustrating that the hCAB model
also produces plausible (individual) human behavior in this strategic network
game.


## AI 摘要

人类网络对社会结果（如贫富差距、健康不平等、霸凌等）有重要影响。研究通过对比不同建模方法（行为匹配 vs. 社区感知行为，均值 vs. 分布建模）在策略性网络游戏"初中生游戏（JHG）"中的表现，发现基于社区感知行为且建模行为分布的hCAB方法最优。该模型能准确模拟小规模群体（6-11人）的动态，且人类参与者无法区分hCAB智能体与真人行为，验证了其个体行为拟真性。这一成果为理解人类网络行为提供了新工具，有助于优化社会干预策略。
