# Modeling Human Behavior in a Strategic Network Game with Complex Group Dynamics

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03795v2

## 原始摘要

Human networks greatly impact important societal outcomes, including wealth
and health inequality, poverty, and bullying. As such, understanding human
networks is critical to learning how to promote favorable societal outcomes. As
a step toward better understanding human networks, we compare and contrast
several methods for learning, from a small data set, models of human behavior
in a strategic network game called the Junior High Game (JHG). These modeling
methods differ with respect to the assumptions they use to parameterize human
behavior (behavior vs. community-aware behavior) and the moments they model
(mean vs. distribution). Results show that the highest-performing method,
called hCAB, models the distribution of human behavior rather than the mean and
assumes humans use community-aware behavior rather than behavior matching. When
applied to small societies (6-11 individuals), the hCAB model closely mirrors
the population dynamics of human groups (with notable differences).
Additionally, in a user study, human participants were unable to distinguish
individual hCAB agents from other humans, thus illustrating that the hCAB model
also produces plausible (individual) human behavior in this strategic network
game.


## AI 摘要

人类网络对社会不平等、贫困和霸凌等关键问题影响深远。研究通过对比不同建模方法，发现基于社区感知行为（hCAB）的分布建模方法最能准确模拟小型社会（6-11人）中的人类行为动态。hCAB不仅群体层面表现优异，其个体代理行为在用户测试中也难以与真人区分。该研究为理解战略网络博弈（如初中生游戏）中的人类行为提供了新视角，表明社区意识和行为分布建模是提升模型拟人度的关键因素，对促进有利社会结果具有潜在价值。（99字）
