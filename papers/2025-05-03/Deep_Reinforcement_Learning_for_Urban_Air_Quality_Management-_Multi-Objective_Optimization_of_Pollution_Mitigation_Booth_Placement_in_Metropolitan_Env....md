## 原始摘要

Urban air pollution remains a pressing global concern, particularly in
densely populated and traffic-intensive metropolitan areas like Delhi, where
exposure to harmful pollutants severely impacts public health. Delhi, being one
of the most polluted cities globally, experiences chronic air quality issues
due to vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and construction dust, which
exacerbate its already fragile atmospheric conditions. Traditional pollution
mitigation strategies, such as static air purifying installations, often fail
to maximize their impact due to suboptimal placement and limited adaptability
to dynamic urban environments. This study presents a novel deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) framework to optimize the placement of air purification booths
to improve the air quality index (AQI) in the city of Delhi. We employ Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm,
to iteratively learn and identify high-impact locations based on multiple
spatial and environmental factors, including population density, traffic
patterns, industrial influence, and green space constraints. Our approach is
benchmarked against conventional placement strategies, including random and
greedy AQI-based methods, using multi-dimensional performance evaluation
metrics such as AQI improvement, spatial coverage, population and traffic
impact, and spatial entropy. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL-based
approach outperforms baseline methods by achieving a balanced and effective
distribution of air purification infrastructure. Notably, the DRL framework
achieves an optimal trade-off between AQI reduction and high-coverage
deployment, ensuring equitable environmental benefits across urban regions. The
findings underscore the potential of AI-driven spatial optimization in
advancing smart city initiatives and data-driven urban air quality management.


## AI 摘要

德里是全球污染最严重的城市之一，主要受交通排放、工业活动和建筑扬尘影响。传统静态空气净化装置因位置不佳和适应性不足效果有限。本研究提出一种深度强化学习（DRL）框架，利用近端策略优化（PPO）算法，根据人口密度、交通模式、工业影响和绿地限制等因素优化空气净化亭的布局。相比随机和贪婪AQI基准方法，DRL方法在多维评估指标（如AQI改善、空间覆盖和人口影响）上表现更优，实现了净化设施的高效均衡分布，在AQI降低和广泛覆盖间取得最佳平衡，展示了AI驱动空间优化在智慧城市空气质量管理的潜力。
