## 原始摘要

Urban air pollution remains a pressing global concern, particularly in
densely populated and traffic-intensive metropolitan areas like Delhi, where
exposure to harmful pollutants severely impacts public health. Delhi, being one
of the most polluted cities globally, experiences chronic air quality issues
due to vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and construction dust, which
exacerbate its already fragile atmospheric conditions. Traditional pollution
mitigation strategies, such as static air purifying installations, often fail
to maximize their impact due to suboptimal placement and limited adaptability
to dynamic urban environments. This study presents a novel deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) framework to optimize the placement of air purification booths
to improve the air quality index (AQI) in the city of Delhi. We employ Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm,
to iteratively learn and identify high-impact locations based on multiple
spatial and environmental factors, including population density, traffic
patterns, industrial influence, and green space constraints. Our approach is
benchmarked against conventional placement strategies, including random and
greedy AQI-based methods, using multi-dimensional performance evaluation
metrics such as AQI improvement, spatial coverage, population and traffic
impact, and spatial entropy. Experimental results demonstrate that the RL-based
approach outperforms baseline methods by achieving a balanced and effective
distribution of air purification infrastructure. Notably, the DRL framework
achieves an optimal trade-off between AQI reduction and high-coverage
deployment, ensuring equitable environmental benefits across urban regions. The
findings underscore the potential of AI-driven spatial optimization in
advancing smart city initiatives and data-driven urban air quality management.


## AI 摘要

德里是全球空气污染最严重的城市之一，主要受交通排放、工业活动和建筑扬尘影响。传统静态空气净化装置因位置不佳和适应性差而效果有限。本研究提出一种基于深度强化学习（DRL）的新框架，利用近端策略优化（PPO）算法，综合考虑人口密度、交通模式、工业影响和绿地限制等因素，优化空气净化亭的布局。实验表明，该方法在空气质量指数（AQI）改善、空间覆盖率和公平性等方面优于随机和贪婪基线策略，实现了净化设施的高效均衡分布，为智慧城市和数据驱动的空气质量治理提供了新思路。
