# Towards Autonomous Micromobility through Scalable Urban Simulation

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00690v1

## 原始摘要

Micromobility, which utilizes lightweight mobile machines moving in urban
public spaces, such as delivery robots and mobility scooters, emerges as a
promising alternative to vehicular mobility. Current micromobility depends
mostly on human manual operation (in-person or remote control), which raises
safety and efficiency concerns when navigating busy urban environments full of
unpredictable obstacles and pedestrians. Assisting humans with AI agents in
maneuvering micromobility devices presents a viable solution for enhancing
safety and efficiency. In this work, we present a scalable urban simulation
solution to advance autonomous micromobility. First, we build URBAN-SIM - a
high-performance robot learning platform for large-scale training of embodied
agents in interactive urban scenes. URBAN-SIM contains three critical modules:
Hierarchical Urban Generation pipeline, Interactive Dynamics Generation
strategy, and Asynchronous Scene Sampling scheme, to improve the diversity,
realism, and efficiency of robot learning in simulation. Then, we propose
URBAN-BENCH - a suite of essential tasks and benchmarks to gauge various
capabilities of the AI agents in achieving autonomous micromobility.
URBAN-BENCH includes eight tasks based on three core skills of the agents:
Urban Locomotion, Urban Navigation, and Urban Traverse. We evaluate four robots
with heterogeneous embodiments, such as the wheeled and legged robots, across
these tasks. Experiments on diverse terrains and urban structures reveal each
robot's strengths and limitations.


## AI 摘要

微型交通（如配送机器人、电动代步车）是城市交通的潜在替代方案，但目前依赖人工操作，存在安全和效率问题。研究提出通过AI代理辅助操作以提升性能，并开发了URBAN-SIM仿真平台，包含分层城市生成、交互动态生成和异步场景采样模块，增强训练多样性、真实性和效率。同时推出URBAN-BENCH评测套件，涵盖8项任务，评估轮式和足式机器人在城市移动、导航和穿越等核心技能的表现。实验揭示了不同机器人在多样化地形与城市结构中的优劣势，为自主微型交通发展提供了可扩展的仿真解决方案。
