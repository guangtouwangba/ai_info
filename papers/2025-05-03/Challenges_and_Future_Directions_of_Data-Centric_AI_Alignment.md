# Challenges and Future Directions of Data-Centric AI Alignment

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01957v2

## 原始摘要

As AI systems become increasingly capable and influential, ensuring their
alignment with human values, preferences, and goals has become a critical
research focus. Current alignment methods primarily focus on designing
algorithms and loss functions but often underestimate the crucial role of data.
This paper advocates for a shift towards data-centric AI alignment, emphasizing
the need to enhance the quality and representativeness of data used in aligning
AI systems. In this position paper, we highlight key challenges associated with
both human-based and AI-based feedback within the data-centric alignment
framework. Through qualitative analysis, we identify multiple sources of
unreliability in human feedback, as well as problems related to temporal drift,
context dependence, and AI-based feedback failing to capture human values due
to inherent model limitations. We propose future research directions, including
improved feedback collection practices, robust data-cleaning methodologies, and
rigorous feedback verification processes. We call for future research into
these critical directions to ensure, addressing gaps that persist in
understanding and improving data-centric alignment practices.


## AI 摘要

本文提出以数据为中心的AI对齐方法，强调提升数据质量和代表性对AI系统与人类价值观对齐的重要性。作者指出当前基于人类和AI反馈的数据对齐存在关键挑战：人类反馈存在不可靠性，AI反馈则受时间漂移、情境依赖和模型局限影响。研究建议未来方向包括改进反馈收集、开发稳健的数据清洗方法及严格验证流程，以弥补现有数据对齐实践的不足。论文呼吁加强相关研究，确保AI系统更好地符合人类价值观和偏好。
