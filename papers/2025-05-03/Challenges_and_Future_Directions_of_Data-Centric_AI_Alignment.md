# Challenges and Future Directions of Data-Centric AI Alignment

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01957v2

## 原始摘要

As AI systems become increasingly capable and influential, ensuring their
alignment with human values, preferences, and goals has become a critical
research focus. Current alignment methods primarily focus on designing
algorithms and loss functions but often underestimate the crucial role of data.
This paper advocates for a shift towards data-centric AI alignment, emphasizing
the need to enhance the quality and representativeness of data used in aligning
AI systems. In this position paper, we highlight key challenges associated with
both human-based and AI-based feedback within the data-centric alignment
framework. Through qualitative analysis, we identify multiple sources of
unreliability in human feedback, as well as problems related to temporal drift,
context dependence, and AI-based feedback failing to capture human values due
to inherent model limitations. We propose future research directions, including
improved feedback collection practices, robust data-cleaning methodologies, and
rigorous feedback verification processes. We call for future research into
these critical directions to ensure, addressing gaps that persist in
understanding and improving data-centric alignment practices.


## AI 摘要

随着AI系统能力增强，确保其与人类价值观对齐成为关键议题。当前对齐方法过度关注算法设计，忽视了数据质量的核心作用。本文提出以数据为中心的AI对齐新范式，指出人类反馈存在可靠性问题（如时间漂移、情境依赖性），AI反馈则受模型局限难以捕捉人类价值观。研究建议三个改进方向：优化反馈收集流程、开发鲁棒的数据清洗方法、建立严格的反馈验证机制，呼吁学界填补数据对齐实践中的认知空白。全文通过定性分析揭示了现有反馈机制的缺陷，为数据驱动的AI对齐研究提供了新思路。（99字）
