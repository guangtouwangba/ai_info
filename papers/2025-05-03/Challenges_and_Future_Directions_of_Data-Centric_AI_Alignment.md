# Challenges and Future Directions of Data-Centric AI Alignment

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01957v2

## 原始摘要

As AI systems become increasingly capable and influential, ensuring their
alignment with human values, preferences, and goals has become a critical
research focus. Current alignment methods primarily focus on designing
algorithms and loss functions but often underestimate the crucial role of data.
This paper advocates for a shift towards data-centric AI alignment, emphasizing
the need to enhance the quality and representativeness of data used in aligning
AI systems. In this position paper, we highlight key challenges associated with
both human-based and AI-based feedback within the data-centric alignment
framework. Through qualitative analysis, we identify multiple sources of
unreliability in human feedback, as well as problems related to temporal drift,
context dependence, and AI-based feedback failing to capture human values due
to inherent model limitations. We propose future research directions, including
improved feedback collection practices, robust data-cleaning methodologies, and
rigorous feedback verification processes. We call for future research into
these critical directions to ensure, addressing gaps that persist in
understanding and improving data-centric alignment practices.


## AI 摘要

随着AI系统日益强大和普及，确保其与人类价值观、偏好和目标的对齐成为关键研究重点。当前对齐方法主要关注算法和损失函数设计，却常忽视数据的关键作用。本文主张转向以数据为中心的AI对齐，强调提升对齐数据的质量和代表性。研究指出人类反馈存在不可靠性，AI反馈则面临时间漂移、情境依赖及模型局限等问题。未来研究方向包括优化反馈收集、开发稳健的数据清洗方法及严格的验证流程，以弥补数据为中心的对齐实践中的认知与实践缺口。
