# Learning An Active Inference Model of Driver Perception and Control: Application to Vehicle Car-Following

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15201v2

## 原始摘要

In this paper we introduce a general estimation methodology for learning a
model of human perception and control in a sensorimotor control task based upon
a finite set of demonstrations. The model's structure consists of i the agent's
internal representation of how the environment and associated observations
evolve as a result of control actions and ii the agent's preferences over
observable outcomes. We consider a model's structure specification consistent
with active inference, a theory of human perception and behavior from cognitive
science. According to active inference, the agent acts upon the world so as to
minimize surprise defined as a measure of the extent to which an agent's
current sensory observations differ from its preferred sensory observations. We
propose a bi-level optimization approach to estimation which relies on a
structural assumption on prior distributions that parameterize the statistical
accuracy of the human agent's model of the environment. To illustrate the
proposed methodology, we present the estimation of a model for car-following
behavior based upon a naturalistic dataset. Overall, the results indicate that
learning active inference models of human perception and control from data is a
promising alternative to black-box models of driving.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种基于有限演示数据来学习人类感知与控制模型的通用估计方法。该模型结构包含：1) 主体对环境动态及控制行为影响的内在表征；2) 主体对可观测结果的偏好。模型遵循主动推理理论，认为人类行为旨在最小化"意外"（当前感知与偏好感知的差异）。作者采用双层优化方法进行估计，并基于先验分布的结构性假设。通过自然驾驶数据中的跟车行为建模验证，结果表明这种主动推理模型相比黑箱模型，能更有效地刻画人类驾驶的感知控制机制，具有良好应用前景。（100字）
