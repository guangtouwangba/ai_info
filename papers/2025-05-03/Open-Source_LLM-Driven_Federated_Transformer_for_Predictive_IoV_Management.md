# Open-Source LLM-Driven Federated Transformer for Predictive IoV Management

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00651v1

## 原始摘要

The proliferation of connected vehicles within the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
ecosystem presents critical challenges in ensuring scalable, real-time, and
privacy-preserving traffic management. Existing centralized IoV solutions often
suffer from high latency, limited scalability, and reliance on proprietary
Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, creating significant barriers to
widespread deployment, particularly in dynamic and privacy-sensitive
environments. Meanwhile, integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in vehicular
systems remains underexplored, especially concerning prompt optimization and
effective utilization in federated contexts. To address these challenges, we
propose the Federated Prompt-Optimized Traffic Transformer (FPoTT), a novel
framework that leverages open-source LLMs for predictive IoV management. FPoTT
introduces a dynamic prompt optimization mechanism that iteratively refines
textual prompts to enhance trajectory prediction. The architecture employs a
dual-layer federated learning paradigm, combining lightweight edge models for
real-time inference with cloud-based LLMs to retain global intelligence. A
Transformer-driven synthetic data generator is incorporated to augment training
with diverse, high-fidelity traffic scenarios in the Next Generation Simulation
(NGSIM) format. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that FPoTT, utilizing
EleutherAI Pythia-1B, achieves 99.86% prediction accuracy on real-world data
while maintaining high performance on synthetic datasets. These results
underscore the potential of open-source LLMs in enabling secure, adaptive, and
scalable IoV management, offering a promising alternative to proprietary
solutions in smart mobility ecosystems.
