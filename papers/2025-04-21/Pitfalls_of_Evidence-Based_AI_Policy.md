# Pitfalls of Evidence-Based AI Policy

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09618v4

## 原始摘要

Nations across the world are working to govern AI. However, from a technical
perspective, there is uncertainty and disagreement on the best way to do this.
Meanwhile, recent debates over AI regulation have led to calls for
"evidence-based AI policy" which emphasize holding regulatory action to a high
evidentiary standard. Evidence is of irreplaceable value to policymaking.
However, holding regulatory action to too high an evidentiary standard can lead
to systematic neglect of certain risks. In historical policy debates (e.g.,
over tobacco ca. 1965 and fossil fuels ca. 1985) "evidence-based policy"
rhetoric is also a well-precedented strategy to downplay the urgency of action,
delay regulation, and protect industry interests. Here, we argue that if the
goal is evidence-based AI policy, the first regulatory objective must be to
actively facilitate the process of identifying, studying, and deliberating
about AI risks. We discuss a set of 15 regulatory goals to facilitate this and
show that Brazil, Canada, China, the EU, South Korea, the UK, and the USA all
have substantial opportunities to adopt further evidence-seeking policies.


## AI 摘要

全球各国正努力治理AI，但技术上仍存在不确定性和分歧。近期关于AI监管的讨论强调"基于证据的政策"，但过高的证据标准可能导致系统性忽视风险。历史上（如1965年烟草、1985年化石燃料争议），这种说辞常被用作拖延监管、保护行业利益的策略。研究表明，要实现真正的证据导向政策，首要监管目标应是积极促进AI风险的识别、研究和审议。论文提出15项促进证据收集的监管目标，指出巴西、加拿大、中国、欧盟、韩国、英国和美国都有机会采取更多证据导向政策。
