**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13822v1

## 原始摘要

The emergence of large pre-trained networks has revolutionized the AI field,
unlocking new possibilities and achieving unprecedented performance. However,
these models inherit a fundamental limitation from traditional Machine Learning
approaches: their strong dependence on the \textit{i.i.d.} assumption hinders
their adaptability to dynamic learning scenarios. We believe the next
breakthrough in AI lies in enabling efficient adaptation to evolving
environments -- such as the real world -- where new data and tasks arrive
sequentially. This challenge defines the field of Continual Learning (CL), a
Machine Learning paradigm focused on developing lifelong learning neural
models. One alternative to efficiently adapt these large-scale models is known
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). These methods tackle the issue of
adapting the model to a particular data or scenario by performing small and
efficient modifications, achieving similar performance to full fine-tuning.
However, these techniques still lack the ability to adjust the model to
multiple tasks continually, as they suffer from the issue of Catastrophic
Forgetting. In this survey, we first provide an overview of CL algorithms and
PEFT methods before reviewing the state-of-the-art on Parameter-Efficient
Continual Fine-Tuning (PECFT). We examine various approaches, discuss
evaluation metrics, and explore potential future research directions. Our goal
is to highlight the synergy between CL and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning,
guide researchers in this field, and pave the way for novel future research
directions.


## AI 摘要

这篇摘要探讨了大预训练模型在持续学习(CL)中的挑战与机遇。传统机器学习依赖i.i.d.假设的局限性阻碍了模型在动态环境中的适应能力。作者指出，参数高效微调(PEFT)虽能有效调整大模型，但仍面临灾难性遗忘问题。文章综述了CL算法、PEFT方法以及参数高效持续微调(PECFT)的最新进展，分析了不同方法、评估指标及未来研究方向。研究旨在促进CL与PEFT的协同发展，为终身学习神经模型的开发提供指导，并开拓新的研究路径。
