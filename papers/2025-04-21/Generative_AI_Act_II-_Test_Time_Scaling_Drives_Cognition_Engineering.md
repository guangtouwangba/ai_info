# Generative AI Act II: Test Time Scaling Drives Cognition Engineering

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13828v1

## 原始摘要

The first generation of Large Language Models - what might be called "Act I"
of generative AI (2020-2023) - achieved remarkable success through massive
parameter and data scaling, yet exhibited fundamental limitations in knowledge
latency, shallow reasoning, and constrained cognitive processes. During this
era, prompt engineering emerged as our primary interface with AI, enabling
dialogue-level communication through natural language. We now witness the
emergence of "Act II" (2024-present), where models are transitioning from
knowledge-retrieval systems (in latent space) to thought-construction engines
through test-time scaling techniques. This new paradigm establishes a
mind-level connection with AI through language-based thoughts. In this paper,
we clarify the conceptual foundations of cognition engineering and explain why
this moment is critical for its development. We systematically break down these
advanced approaches through comprehensive tutorials and optimized
implementations, democratizing access to cognition engineering and enabling
every practitioner to participate in AI's second act. We provide a regularly
updated collection of papers on test-time scaling in the GitHub Repository:

## AI 摘要

第一代大语言模型（2020-2023）通过大规模参数和数据扩展取得显著成功，但仍存在知识滞后、浅层推理和认知局限等问题。这一时期，提示工程成为人机交互的主要方式。当前进入"第二阶段"（2024至今），模型正从潜在空间的知识检索系统转变为通过测试时扩展技术构建的思维引擎，实现基于语言思维的深层次连接。本文阐明了认知工程的概念基础，系统分解了先进方法，通过教程和优化实现推动技术民主化，使更多从业者能参与AI发展的新阶段。相关论文资源见GitHub仓库。
