# Generative AI Act II: Test Time Scaling Drives Cognition Engineering

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13828v1

## 原始摘要

The first generation of Large Language Models - what might be called "Act I"
of generative AI (2020-2023) - achieved remarkable success through massive
parameter and data scaling, yet exhibited fundamental limitations in knowledge
latency, shallow reasoning, and constrained cognitive processes. During this
era, prompt engineering emerged as our primary interface with AI, enabling
dialogue-level communication through natural language. We now witness the
emergence of "Act II" (2024-present), where models are transitioning from
knowledge-retrieval systems (in latent space) to thought-construction engines
through test-time scaling techniques. This new paradigm establishes a
mind-level connection with AI through language-based thoughts. In this paper,
we clarify the conceptual foundations of cognition engineering and explain why
this moment is critical for its development. We systematically break down these
advanced approaches through comprehensive tutorials and optimized
implementations, democratizing access to cognition engineering and enabling
every practitioner to participate in AI's second act. We provide a regularly
updated collection of papers on test-time scaling in the GitHub Repository:

## AI 摘要

这篇论文将生成式AI的发展分为两个阶段："第一幕"（2020-2023）的大型语言模型通过参数和数据扩展取得显著成功，但存在知识滞后、推理浅层等局限，主要依赖提示工程进行交互；"第二幕"（2024起）的模型正从知识检索系统转变为思维构建引擎，通过测试时扩展技术实现基于语言的思维层面连接。作者阐述了认知工程的概念基础和发展时机，通过教程和优化实现系统解析这些先进方法，使认知工程民主化。论文附有GitHub资源库持续更新测试时扩展相关研究。
