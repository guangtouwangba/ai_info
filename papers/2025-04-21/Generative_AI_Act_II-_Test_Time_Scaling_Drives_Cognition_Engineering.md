# Generative AI Act II: Test Time Scaling Drives Cognition Engineering

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13828v1

## 原始摘要

The first generation of Large Language Models - what might be called "Act I"
of generative AI (2020-2023) - achieved remarkable success through massive
parameter and data scaling, yet exhibited fundamental limitations in knowledge
latency, shallow reasoning, and constrained cognitive processes. During this
era, prompt engineering emerged as our primary interface with AI, enabling
dialogue-level communication through natural language. We now witness the
emergence of "Act II" (2024-present), where models are transitioning from
knowledge-retrieval systems (in latent space) to thought-construction engines
through test-time scaling techniques. This new paradigm establishes a
mind-level connection with AI through language-based thoughts. In this paper,
we clarify the conceptual foundations of cognition engineering and explain why
this moment is critical for its development. We systematically break down these
advanced approaches through comprehensive tutorials and optimized
implementations, democratizing access to cognition engineering and enabling
every practitioner to participate in AI's second act. We provide a regularly
updated collection of papers on test-time scaling in the GitHub Repository:

## AI 摘要

第一代大语言模型（2020-2023）通过大规模参数和数据扩展取得显著成功，但存在知识滞后、浅层推理和认知受限等问题，主要依赖提示工程进行交互。当前进入"第二代"（2024至今），模型正从潜在空间的知识检索系统转变为通过测试时扩展技术构建思维引擎，实现基于语言思维的深层次AI交互。本文阐明认知工程的概念基础，分析其发展关键性，并通过系统教程和优化实现推广该技术，使更多实践者能参与AI新阶段。相关测试时扩展论文合集持续更新于GitHub仓库。
