# Audit Cards: Contextualizing AI Evaluations

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13839v1

## 原始摘要

AI governance frameworks increasingly rely on audits, yet the results of
their underlying evaluations require interpretation and context to be
meaningfully informative. Even technically rigorous evaluations can offer
little useful insight if reported selectively or obscurely. Current literature
focuses primarily on technical best practices, but evaluations are an
inherently sociotechnical process, and there is little guidance on reporting
procedures and context. Through literature review, stakeholder interviews, and
analysis of governance frameworks, we propose "audit cards" to make this
context explicit. We identify six key types of contextual features to report
and justify in audit cards: auditor identity, evaluation scope, methodology,
resource access, process integrity, and review mechanisms. Through analysis of
existing evaluation reports, we find significant variation in reporting
practices, with most reports omitting crucial contextual information such as
auditors' backgrounds, conflicts of interest, and the level and type of access
to models. We also find that most existing regulations and frameworks lack
guidance on rigorous reporting. In response to these shortcomings, we argue
that audit cards can provide a structured format for reporting key claims
alongside their justifications, enhancing transparency, facilitating proper
interpretation, and establishing trust in reporting.


## AI 摘要

当前AI治理框架依赖审计，但评估结果需要背景信息才能有效解读。现有研究主要关注技术实践，而评估本质上是社会技术过程，缺乏对报告流程和背景的指导。通过文献综述和利益相关者访谈，研究者提出"审计卡片"来明确六类关键背景信息：审计者身份、评估范围、方法、资源访问、流程完整性和审查机制。分析发现，现有报告常遗漏审计者背景、利益冲突和模型访问权限等关键信息，且多数法规缺乏严格报告指引。审计卡片通过结构化格式增强透明度，促进正确解读并建立报告可信度。（100字）
