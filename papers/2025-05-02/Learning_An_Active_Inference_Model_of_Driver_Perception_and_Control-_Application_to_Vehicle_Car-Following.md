# Learning An Active Inference Model of Driver Perception and Control: Application to Vehicle Car-Following

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15201v2

## 原始摘要

In this paper we introduce a general estimation methodology for learning a
model of human perception and control in a sensorimotor control task based upon
a finite set of demonstrations. The model's structure consists of i the agent's
internal representation of how the environment and associated observations
evolve as a result of control actions and ii the agent's preferences over
observable outcomes. We consider a model's structure specification consistent
with active inference, a theory of human perception and behavior from cognitive
science. According to active inference, the agent acts upon the world so as to
minimize surprise defined as a measure of the extent to which an agent's
current sensory observations differ from its preferred sensory observations. We
propose a bi-level optimization approach to estimation which relies on a
structural assumption on prior distributions that parameterize the statistical
accuracy of the human agent's model of the environment. To illustrate the
proposed methodology, we present the estimation of a model for car-following
behavior based upon a naturalistic dataset. Overall, the results indicate that
learning active inference models of human perception and control from data is a
promising alternative to black-box models of driving.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文提出了一种基于有限演示数据来建模人类感知与控制行为的方法。该模型包含两个核心部分：1) 个体对环境状态演变的内部表征；2) 个体对可观测结果的偏好。研究采用主动推理理论框架，认为人类行为是为了最小化"意外"（实际观察与偏好观察的差异）。作者提出双层优化估计方法，通过对先验分布的结构化假设来参数化人类对环境模型的统计准确性。以跟车行为为例，基于自然驾驶数据的建模结果表明，这种主动推理模型相比黑箱模型能更好地解释人类驾驶行为，展现出良好的应用前景。（99字）
