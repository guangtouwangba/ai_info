# Challenges and Future Directions of Data-Centric AI Alignment

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01957v2

## 原始摘要

As AI systems become increasingly capable and influential, ensuring their
alignment with human values, preferences, and goals has become a critical
research focus. Current alignment methods primarily focus on designing
algorithms and loss functions but often underestimate the crucial role of data.
This paper advocates for a shift towards data-centric AI alignment, emphasizing
the need to enhance the quality and representativeness of data used in aligning
AI systems. In this position paper, we highlight key challenges associated with
both human-based and AI-based feedback within the data-centric alignment
framework. Through qualitative analysis, we identify multiple sources of
unreliability in human feedback, as well as problems related to temporal drift,
context dependence, and AI-based feedback failing to capture human values due
to inherent model limitations. We propose future research directions, including
improved feedback collection practices, robust data-cleaning methodologies, and
rigorous feedback verification processes. We call for future research into
these critical directions to ensure, addressing gaps that persist in
understanding and improving data-centric alignment practices.


## AI 摘要

当前AI对齐研究主要关注算法设计，但低估了数据的关键作用。本文提出以数据为中心的AI对齐新范式，强调提升数据质量和代表性。研究揭示了人类反馈存在不可靠性，以及AI反馈因模型局限难以捕捉人类价值观等问题，包括时间漂移和情境依赖性等挑战。未来研究方向包括：改进反馈收集方法、开发鲁棒的数据清洗技术、建立严格的反馈验证流程。该研究呼吁填补数据为中心的对齐实践中的认知空白，为构建更符合人类价值观的AI系统提供新思路。（100字）
