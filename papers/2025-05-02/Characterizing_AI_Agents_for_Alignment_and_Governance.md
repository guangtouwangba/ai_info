# Characterizing AI Agents for Alignment and Governance

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21848v1

## 原始摘要

The creation of effective governance mechanisms for AI agents requires a
deeper understanding of their core properties and how these properties relate
to questions surrounding the deployment and operation of agents in the world.
This paper provides a characterization of AI agents that focuses on four
dimensions: autonomy, efficacy, goal complexity, and generality. We propose
different gradations for each dimension, and argue that each dimension raises
unique questions about the design, operation, and governance of these systems.
Moreover, we draw upon this framework to construct "agentic profiles" for
different kinds of AI agents. These profiles help to illuminate cross-cutting
technical and non-technical governance challenges posed by different classes of
AI agents, ranging from narrow task-specific assistants to highly autonomous
general-purpose systems. By mapping out key axes of variation and continuity,
this framework provides developers, policymakers, and members of the public
with the opportunity to develop governance approaches that better align with
collective societal goals.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文提出了一个AI智能体的四维框架（自主性、效能、目标复杂性和通用性），用于分析不同智能体的核心特性及其治理挑战。作者通过定义每个维度的梯度差异，构建了"智能体特征图谱"，帮助区分从单一任务助手到高度自主通用系统的各类AI。该框架揭示了不同智能体在技术和社会治理方面的共性与差异，为开发者、政策制定者和公众提供了系统性工具，以制定更符合社会集体目标的治理方案。研究强调需要根据智能体的具体特征来设计针对性的监管措施。
