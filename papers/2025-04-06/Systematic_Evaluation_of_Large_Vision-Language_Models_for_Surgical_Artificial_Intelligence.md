## 原始摘要

Large Vision-Language Models offer a new paradigm for AI-driven image
understanding, enabling models to perform tasks without task-specific training.
This flexibility holds particular promise across medicine, where
expert-annotated data is scarce. Yet, VLMs' practical utility in
intervention-focused domains--especially surgery, where decision-making is
subjective and clinical scenarios are variable--remains uncertain. Here, we
present a comprehensive analysis of 11 state-of-the-art VLMs across 17 key
visual understanding tasks in surgical AI--from anatomy recognition to skill
assessment--using 13 datasets spanning laparoscopic, robotic, and open
procedures. In our experiments, VLMs demonstrate promising generalizability, at
times outperforming supervised models when deployed outside their training
setting. In-context learning, incorporating examples during testing, boosted
performance up to three-fold, suggesting adaptability as a key strength. Still,
tasks requiring spatial or temporal reasoning remained difficult. Beyond
surgery, our findings offer insights into VLMs' potential for tackling complex
and dynamic scenarios in clinical and broader real-world applications.
