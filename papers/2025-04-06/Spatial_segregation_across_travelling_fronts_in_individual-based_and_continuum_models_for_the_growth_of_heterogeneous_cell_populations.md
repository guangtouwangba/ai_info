# Spatial segregation across travelling fronts in individual-based and continuum models for the growth of heterogeneous cell populations

## 原始摘要

We consider a partial differential equation model for the growth of
heterogeneous cell populations subdivided into multiple distinct discrete
phenotypes. In this model, cells preferentially move towards regions where they
feel less compressed, and thus their movement occurs down the gradient of the
cellular pressure, which is defined as a weighted sum of the densities (i.e.
the volume fractions) of cells with different phenotypes. To translate into
mathematical terms the idea that cells with distinct phenotypes have different
morphological and mechanical properties, both the cell mobility and the
weighted amount the cells contribute to the cellular pressure vary with their
phenotype. We formally derive this model as the continuum limit of an
on-lattice individual-based model, where cells are represented as single agents
undergoing a branching biased random walk corresponding to phenotype-dependent
and pressure-regulated cell division, death, and movement. Then, we study
travelling wave solutions whereby cells with different phenotypes are spatially
segregated across the invading front. Finally, we report on numerical
simulations of the two models, demonstrating excellent agreement between them
and the travelling wave analysis. The results presented here indicate that
inter-cellular variability in mobility can provide the substrate for the
emergence of spatial segregation across invading cell fronts.

该研究构建了一个异质性细胞群体的偏微分方程模型，将细胞划分为多个离散表型。模型假设细胞会向压缩较小区域迁移（沿细胞压力梯度方向），其中压力定义为不同表型细胞密度的加权和。通过将细胞表型差异量化为移动性和压力贡献度的差异，研究者从基于个体的离散模型推导出连续极限模型。重点分析了入侵前沿出现表型空间分离的行波解，并通过数值模拟验证了离散与连续模型的一致性。结果表明，细胞移动性的异质性可能导致入侵前沿的空间表型分离。
