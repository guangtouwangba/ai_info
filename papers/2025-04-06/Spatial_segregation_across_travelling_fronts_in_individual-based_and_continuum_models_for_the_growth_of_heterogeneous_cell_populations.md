# Spatial segregation across travelling fronts in individual-based and continuum models for the growth of heterogeneous cell populations

## 原始摘要

We consider a partial differential equation model for the growth of
heterogeneous cell populations subdivided into multiple distinct discrete
phenotypes. In this model, cells preferentially move towards regions where they
feel less compressed, and thus their movement occurs down the gradient of the
cellular pressure, which is defined as a weighted sum of the densities (i.e.
the volume fractions) of cells with different phenotypes. To translate into
mathematical terms the idea that cells with distinct phenotypes have different
morphological and mechanical properties, both the cell mobility and the
weighted amount the cells contribute to the cellular pressure vary with their
phenotype. We formally derive this model as the continuum limit of an
on-lattice individual-based model, where cells are represented as single agents
undergoing a branching biased random walk corresponding to phenotype-dependent
and pressure-regulated cell division, death, and movement. Then, we study
travelling wave solutions whereby cells with different phenotypes are spatially
segregated across the invading front. Finally, we report on numerical
simulations of the two models, demonstrating excellent agreement between them
and the travelling wave analysis. The results presented here indicate that
inter-cellular variability in mobility can provide the substrate for the
emergence of spatial segregation across invading cell fronts.

该研究构建了一个异质性细胞群体生长的偏微分方程模型，将细胞划分为多个离散表型。模型假设细胞会向压缩较小的区域迁移，其运动方向沿细胞压力梯度下降方向。细胞压力定义为不同表型细胞密度的加权和，且细胞迁移率和压力贡献权重随表型而异。研究从基于个体的晶格模型推导出该连续模型，分析了细胞表型依赖和压力调节的分裂、死亡及迁移行为。通过数值模拟和行波解分析发现，细胞迁移率的异质性可导致入侵前沿出现空间表型隔离现象。模拟结果与理论分析高度吻合。
