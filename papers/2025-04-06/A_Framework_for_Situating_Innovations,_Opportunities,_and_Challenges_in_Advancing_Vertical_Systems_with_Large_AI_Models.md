# A Framework for Situating Innovations, Opportunities, and Challenges in Advancing Vertical Systems with Large AI Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02793v1

## 原始摘要

Large artificial intelligence (AI) models have garnered significant attention
for their remarkable, often "superhuman", performance on standardized
benchmarks. However, when these models are deployed in high-stakes verticals
such as healthcare, education, and law, they often reveal notable limitations.
For instance, they exhibit brittleness to minor variations in input data,
present contextually uninformed decisions in critical settings, and undermine
user trust by confidently producing or reproducing inaccuracies. These
challenges in applying large models necessitate cross-disciplinary innovations
to align the models' capabilities with the needs of real-world applications. We
introduce a framework that addresses this gap through a layer-wise abstraction
of innovations aimed at meeting users' requirements with large models. Through
multiple case studies, we illustrate how researchers and practitioners across
various fields can operationalize this framework. Beyond modularizing the
pipeline of transforming large models into useful "vertical systems", we also
highlight the dynamism that exists within different layers of the framework.
Finally, we discuss how our framework can guide researchers and practitioners
to (i) optimally situate their innovations (e.g., when vertical-specific
insights can empower broadly impactful vertical-agnostic innovations), (ii)
uncover overlooked opportunities (e.g., spotting recurring problems across
verticals to develop practically useful foundation models instead of chasing
benchmarks), and (iii) facilitate cross-disciplinary communication of critical
challenges (e.g., enabling a shared vocabulary for AI developers, domain
experts, and human-computer interaction scholars).


## AI 摘要

大型AI模型在标准化测试中表现优异，但在医疗、教育等高风险领域应用时，常暴露脆弱性、缺乏情境理解等问题。为此，研究提出一个分层创新框架，通过模块化设计将大模型转化为实用的垂直系统，并强调各层间的动态协作。该框架帮助研究者：（1）定位创新方向（如垂直领域洞察如何推动通用创新）；（2）发现被忽视的机会（如跨领域共性问题可指导实用基础模型开发）；（3）促进跨学科交流（如为开发者、领域专家建立共同语言）。案例研究表明该框架能有效协调模型能力与实际需求。
