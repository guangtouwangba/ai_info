# Scaling Laws in Scientific Discovery with AI and Robot Scientists

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22444v2

## 原始摘要

Scientific discovery is poised for rapid advancement through advanced
robotics and artificial intelligence. Current scientific practices face
substantial limitations as manual experimentation remains time-consuming and
resource-intensive, while multidisciplinary research demands knowledge
integration beyond individual researchers' expertise boundaries. Here, we
envision an autonomous generalist scientist (AGS) concept combines agentic AI
and embodied robotics to automate the entire research lifecycle. This system
could dynamically interact with both physical and virtual environments while
facilitating the integration of knowledge across diverse scientific
disciplines. By deploying these technologies throughout every research stage --
spanning literature review, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and
manuscript writing -- and incorporating internal reflection alongside external
feedback, this system aims to significantly reduce the time and resources
needed for scientific discovery. Building on the evolution from virtual AI
scientists to versatile generalist AI-based robot scientists, AGS promises
groundbreaking potential. As these autonomous systems become increasingly
integrated into the research process, we hypothesize that scientific discovery
might adhere to new scaling laws, potentially shaped by the number and
capabilities of these autonomous systems, offering novel perspectives on how
knowledge is generated and evolves. The adaptability of embodied robots to
extreme environments, paired with the flywheel effect of accumulating
scientific knowledge, holds the promise of continually pushing beyond both
physical and intellectual frontiers.


## AI 摘要

本文提出"自主通用科学家"(AGS)概念，通过结合人工智能代理和机器人技术实现科研全流程自动化。该系统能动态交互物理/虚拟环境，整合跨学科知识，覆盖文献综述、假设生成、实验操作到论文撰写的完整研究周期。相比耗时费力的人工研究，AGS通过内省与外部反馈机制可显著提升科研效率。随着从虚拟AI科学家到多功能机器人科学家的进化，AGS有望建立新的科研规模定律——其发现效率可能取决于自主系统的数量与能力。这种能适应极端环境的机器人系统与科学知识的"飞轮效应"相结合，将持续突破人类认知边界。
