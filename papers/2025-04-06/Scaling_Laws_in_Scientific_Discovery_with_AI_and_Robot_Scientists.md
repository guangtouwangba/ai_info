# Scaling Laws in Scientific Discovery with AI and Robot Scientists

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22444v2

## 原始摘要

Scientific discovery is poised for rapid advancement through advanced
robotics and artificial intelligence. Current scientific practices face
substantial limitations as manual experimentation remains time-consuming and
resource-intensive, while multidisciplinary research demands knowledge
integration beyond individual researchers' expertise boundaries. Here, we
envision an autonomous generalist scientist (AGS) concept combines agentic AI
and embodied robotics to automate the entire research lifecycle. This system
could dynamically interact with both physical and virtual environments while
facilitating the integration of knowledge across diverse scientific
disciplines. By deploying these technologies throughout every research stage --
spanning literature review, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and
manuscript writing -- and incorporating internal reflection alongside external
feedback, this system aims to significantly reduce the time and resources
needed for scientific discovery. Building on the evolution from virtual AI
scientists to versatile generalist AI-based robot scientists, AGS promises
groundbreaking potential. As these autonomous systems become increasingly
integrated into the research process, we hypothesize that scientific discovery
might adhere to new scaling laws, potentially shaped by the number and
capabilities of these autonomous systems, offering novel perspectives on how
knowledge is generated and evolves. The adaptability of embodied robots to
extreme environments, paired with the flywheel effect of accumulating
scientific knowledge, holds the promise of continually pushing beyond both
physical and intellectual frontiers.


## AI 摘要

本文提出"自主通用科学家"（AGS）概念，通过结合人工智能与机器人技术实现科研全流程自动化。该系统能整合多学科知识，自主完成文献综述、假设生成、实验操作到论文撰写的完整科研周期，显著提升研究效率。AGS融合虚拟AI科学家与实体机器人优势，既能适应极端环境，又能通过持续的知识积累形成"飞轮效应"，突破人类认知与物理限制。研究者推测，随着这类自主系统的普及，科学发现可能遵循新的规模定律，其发展速度将由自主系统的数量与能力决定，这将彻底改变知识生产与演进的模式。
