# Do Two AI Scientists Agree?

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02822v1

## 原始摘要

When two AI models are trained on the same scientific task, do they learn the
same theory or two different theories? Throughout history of science, we have
witnessed the rise and fall of theories driven by experimental validation or
falsification: many theories may co-exist when experimental data is lacking,
but the space of survived theories become more constrained with more
experimental data becoming available. We show the same story is true for AI
scientists. With increasingly more systems provided in training data, AI
scientists tend to converge in the theories they learned, although sometimes
they form distinct groups corresponding to different theories. To
mechanistically interpret what theories AI scientists learn and quantify their
agreement, we propose MASS, Hamiltonian-Lagrangian neural networks as AI
Scientists, trained on standard problems in physics, aggregating training
results across many seeds simulating the different configurations of AI
scientists. Our findings suggests for AI scientists switch from learning a
Hamiltonian theory in simple setups to a Lagrangian formulation when more
complex systems are introduced. We also observe strong seed dependence of the
training dynamics and final learned weights, controlling the rise and fall of
relevant theories. We finally demonstrate that not only can our neural networks
aid interpretability, it can also be applied to higher dimensional problems.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文探讨了当两个AI模型在相同科学任务上训练时，它们是否会学习相同的理论。研究表明，随着训练数据中系统数量的增加，AI科学家（即神经网络模型）倾向于收敛到相似的理论，但有时会形成不同的理论群体。作者提出了MASS方法（哈密顿-拉格朗日神经网络）来量化这种一致性，发现AI科学家在简单系统中学习哈密顿理论，而在复杂系统中转向拉格朗日表述。训练动态和最终权重表现出强烈的随机种子依赖性，影响着不同理论的兴衰。该方法不仅提高了可解释性，还能应用于高维问题。
