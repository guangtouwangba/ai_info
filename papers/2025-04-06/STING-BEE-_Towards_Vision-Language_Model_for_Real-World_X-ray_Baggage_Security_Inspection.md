# STING-BEE: Towards Vision-Language Model for Real-World X-ray Baggage Security Inspection

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02823v1

## 原始摘要

Advancements in Computer-Aided Screening (CAS) systems are essential for
improving the detection of security threats in X-ray baggage scans. However,
current datasets are limited in representing real-world, sophisticated threats
and concealment tactics, and existing approaches are constrained by a
closed-set paradigm with predefined labels. To address these challenges, we
introduce STCray, the first multimodal X-ray baggage security dataset,
comprising 46,642 image-caption paired scans across 21 threat categories,
generated using an X-ray scanner for airport security. STCray is meticulously
developed with our specialized protocol that ensures domain-aware, coherent
captions, that lead to the multi-modal instruction following data in X-ray
baggage security. This allows us to train a domain-aware visual AI assistant
named STING-BEE that supports a range of vision-language tasks, including scene
comprehension, referring threat localization, visual grounding, and visual
question answering (VQA), establishing novel baselines for multi-modal learning
in X-ray baggage security. Further, STING-BEE shows state-of-the-art
generalization in cross-domain settings. Code, data, and models are available

## AI 摘要

本文介绍了STCray，首个多模态X射线行李安检数据集，包含46,642张图像-文本配对的扫描图像，涵盖21种威胁类别。该数据集采用专门协议开发，确保生成领域感知且连贯的文本描述，从而支持多模态指令跟随数据。基于此，研究者训练了领域感知视觉AI助手STING-BEE，能够执行场景理解、威胁定位、视觉定位和视觉问答等视觉-语言任务，为X射线行李安检中的多模态学习设立了新基准。STING-BEE在跨域设置中表现出最先进的泛化能力。相关代码、数据和模型已开源。
