# Safety-Aware Multi-Agent Learning for Dynamic Network Bridging

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01551v2

## 原始摘要

Addressing complex cooperative tasks in safety-critical environments poses
significant challenges for multi-agent systems, especially under conditions of
partial observability. We focus on a dynamic network bridging task, where
agents must learn to maintain a communication path between two moving targets.
To ensure safety during training and deployment, we integrate a
control-theoretic safety filter that enforces collision avoidance through local
setpoint updates. We develop and evaluate multi-agent reinforcement learning
safety-informed message passing, showing that encoding safety filter
activations as edge-level features improves coordination. The results suggest
that local safety enforcement and decentralized learning can be effectively
combined in distributed multi-agent tasks.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了在部分可观测的安全关键环境中，多智能体系统执行复杂协作任务（如动态网络桥接）的挑战。通过整合控制理论的安全过滤器，系统在训练和部署阶段实现了碰撞避免。研究发现，将安全过滤器激活编码为边缘级特征可提升协调能力，表明局部安全执行与分散学习能有效结合。该方法为分布式多智能体任务提供了安全增强的解决方案。
