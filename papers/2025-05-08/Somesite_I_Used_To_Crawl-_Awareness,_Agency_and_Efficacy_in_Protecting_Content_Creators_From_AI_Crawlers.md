# Somesite I Used To Crawl: Awareness, Agency and Efficacy in Protecting Content Creators From AI Crawlers

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15091v2

## 原始摘要

The success of generative AI relies heavily on training on data scraped
through extensive crawling of the Internet, a practice that has raised
significant copyright, privacy, and ethical concerns. While few measures are
designed to resist a resource-rich adversary determined to scrape a site,
crawlers can be impacted by a range of existing tools such as robots.txt, NoAI
meta tags, and active crawler blocking by reverse proxies.
  In this work, we seek to understand the ability and efficacy of today's
networking tools to protect content creators against AI-related crawling. For
targeted populations like human artists, do they have the technical knowledge
and agency to utilize crawler-blocking tools such as robots.txt, and can such
tools be effective? Using large scale measurements and a targeted user study of
203 professional artists, we find strong demand for tools like robots.txt, but
significantly constrained by critical hurdles in technical awareness, agency in
deploying them, and limited efficacy against unresponsive crawlers. We further
test and evaluate network-level crawler blockers provided by reverse proxies.
Despite relatively limited deployment today, they offer stronger protections
against AI crawlers, but still come with their own set of limitations.


## AI 摘要

生成式AI的成功依赖从互联网抓取的大量训练数据，但此举引发了版权、隐私和伦理争议。虽然现有工具（如robots.txt、NoAI标签、反向代理拦截）能影响爬虫，但难以阻止资源充足的恶意抓取。本研究调查了当前网络工具保护创作者免遭AI爬取的能力，特别针对艺术家群体。通过大规模测量和对203位专业艺术家的调研发现：尽管robots.txt等工具需求强烈，但受限于技术认知不足、部署权限缺失及对违规爬虫的无效性。反向代理提供的网络级拦截虽更有效，但普及率低且存在局限性。
