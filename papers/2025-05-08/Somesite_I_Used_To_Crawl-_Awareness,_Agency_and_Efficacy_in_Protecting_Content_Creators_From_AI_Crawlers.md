# Somesite I Used To Crawl: Awareness, Agency and Efficacy in Protecting Content Creators From AI Crawlers

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15091v2

## 原始摘要

The success of generative AI relies heavily on training on data scraped
through extensive crawling of the Internet, a practice that has raised
significant copyright, privacy, and ethical concerns. While few measures are
designed to resist a resource-rich adversary determined to scrape a site,
crawlers can be impacted by a range of existing tools such as robots.txt, NoAI
meta tags, and active crawler blocking by reverse proxies.
  In this work, we seek to understand the ability and efficacy of today's
networking tools to protect content creators against AI-related crawling. For
targeted populations like human artists, do they have the technical knowledge
and agency to utilize crawler-blocking tools such as robots.txt, and can such
tools be effective? Using large scale measurements and a targeted user study of
203 professional artists, we find strong demand for tools like robots.txt, but
significantly constrained by critical hurdles in technical awareness, agency in
deploying them, and limited efficacy against unresponsive crawlers. We further
test and evaluate network-level crawler blockers provided by reverse proxies.
Despite relatively limited deployment today, they offer stronger protections
against AI crawlers, but still come with their own set of limitations.


## AI 摘要

当前生成式AI依赖网络爬取数据进行训练，引发版权、隐私和伦理争议。现有工具（如robots.txt、NoAI元标签、反向代理拦截）虽能影响爬虫，但难以阻止资源充足的恶意爬取。本研究通过大规模测量和203名职业艺术家的调研发现：艺术家虽强烈需求反爬工具，但受限于技术认知不足、部署权限缺失及工具对无响应爬虫的失效问题。网络级拦截（如反向代理）防护效果更强但普及率低，仍存在局限性。研究揭示了当前网络工具在保护创作者对抗AI爬取时的能力缺口与实施障碍。
