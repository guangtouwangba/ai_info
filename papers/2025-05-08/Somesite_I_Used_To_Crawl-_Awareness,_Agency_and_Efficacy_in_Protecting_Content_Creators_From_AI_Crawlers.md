# Somesite I Used To Crawl: Awareness, Agency and Efficacy in Protecting Content Creators From AI Crawlers

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15091v2

## 原始摘要

The success of generative AI relies heavily on training on data scraped
through extensive crawling of the Internet, a practice that has raised
significant copyright, privacy, and ethical concerns. While few measures are
designed to resist a resource-rich adversary determined to scrape a site,
crawlers can be impacted by a range of existing tools such as robots.txt, NoAI
meta tags, and active crawler blocking by reverse proxies.
  In this work, we seek to understand the ability and efficacy of today's
networking tools to protect content creators against AI-related crawling. For
targeted populations like human artists, do they have the technical knowledge
and agency to utilize crawler-blocking tools such as robots.txt, and can such
tools be effective? Using large scale measurements and a targeted user study of
203 professional artists, we find strong demand for tools like robots.txt, but
significantly constrained by critical hurdles in technical awareness, agency in
deploying them, and limited efficacy against unresponsive crawlers. We further
test and evaluate network-level crawler blockers provided by reverse proxies.
Despite relatively limited deployment today, they offer stronger protections
against AI crawlers, but still come with their own set of limitations.


## AI 摘要

这篇研究探讨了当前网络工具(如robots.txt、NoAI标签和反向代理拦截)在保护内容创作者免受AI爬取方面的效果。通过对203名专业艺术家的调查和大规模测量发现，虽然艺术家们强烈需要这类工具，但面临技术认知不足、部署能力有限以及工具对不响应爬虫效果不佳等障碍。研究还发现，反向代理提供的网络级拦截虽能提供更强保护，但目前部署较少且自身存在局限性。总体而言，现有工具难以有效阻止资源充足的AI数据爬取行为，突显了版权保护与AI发展之间的技术鸿沟。
