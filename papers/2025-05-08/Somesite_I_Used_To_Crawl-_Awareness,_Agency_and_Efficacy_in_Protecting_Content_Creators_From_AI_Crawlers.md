# Somesite I Used To Crawl: Awareness, Agency and Efficacy in Protecting Content Creators From AI Crawlers

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15091v2

## 原始摘要

The success of generative AI relies heavily on training on data scraped
through extensive crawling of the Internet, a practice that has raised
significant copyright, privacy, and ethical concerns. While few measures are
designed to resist a resource-rich adversary determined to scrape a site,
crawlers can be impacted by a range of existing tools such as robots.txt, NoAI
meta tags, and active crawler blocking by reverse proxies.
  In this work, we seek to understand the ability and efficacy of today's
networking tools to protect content creators against AI-related crawling. For
targeted populations like human artists, do they have the technical knowledge
and agency to utilize crawler-blocking tools such as robots.txt, and can such
tools be effective? Using large scale measurements and a targeted user study of
203 professional artists, we find strong demand for tools like robots.txt, but
significantly constrained by critical hurdles in technical awareness, agency in
deploying them, and limited efficacy against unresponsive crawlers. We further
test and evaluate network-level crawler blockers provided by reverse proxies.
Despite relatively limited deployment today, they offer stronger protections
against AI crawlers, but still come with their own set of limitations.


## AI 摘要

这篇研究探讨了当前网络工具（如robots.txt、NoAI标签和反向代理）在保护内容创作者免受AI爬取方面的效果。通过大规模测量和对203名专业艺术家的调查，研究发现虽然艺术家对这类工具需求强烈，但受限于技术认知不足、部署能力有限以及工具对不响应爬虫的防护效果不佳。反向代理提供的网络级防护虽然更有效，但目前部署较少且存在局限性。研究揭示了现有工具在应对AI数据爬取时的不足，突显了内容创作者在技术意识和防护手段上的双重困境。
