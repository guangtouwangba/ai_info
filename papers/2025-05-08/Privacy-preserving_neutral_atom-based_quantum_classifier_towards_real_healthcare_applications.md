## 原始摘要

Technological advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning
(ML) for the healthcare domain are rapidly arising, with a growing discussion
regarding the ethical management of their development. In general, ML
healthcare applications crucially require performance, interpretability of
data, and respect for data privacy. The latter is an increasingly debated topic
as commercial cloud computing services become more and more widespread.
Recently, dedicated methods are starting to be developed aiming to protect data
privacy. However, these generally result in a trade-off forcing one to balance
the level of data privacy and the algorithm performance. Here, a Support Vector
Machine (SVM) classifier model is proposed whose training is reformulated into
a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, and adapted to a
neutral atom-based Quantum Processing Unit (QPU). Our final model does not
require anonymization techniques to protect data privacy since the sensitive
data are not needed to be transferred to the cloud-available QPU. Indeed, the
latter is used only during the training phase, hence allowing a future concrete
application in a real-world scenario. Finally, performance and scaling analyses
on a publicly available breast cancer dataset are discussed, both using ideal
and noisy simulations for the training process, and also successfully tested on
a currently available real neutral-atom QPU.


## AI 摘要

人工智能和机器学习在医疗领域的应用迅速发展，但数据隐私保护成为关键挑战。本研究提出一种支持向量机(SVM)分类器模型，将其训练过程重新表述为二次无约束二进制优化(QUBO)问题，并适配中性原子量子处理器(QPU)。该创新方法无需将敏感数据传输至云端即可完成训练，从根本上避免了隐私泄露风险。研究使用公开乳腺癌数据集进行测试，通过理想和噪声模拟验证了性能，并成功在实际QPU上运行。这种方法在保持算法性能的同时，解决了医疗AI应用中数据隐私保护的难题。
