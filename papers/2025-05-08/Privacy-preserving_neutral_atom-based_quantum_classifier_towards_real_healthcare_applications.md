## 原始摘要

Technological advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning
(ML) for the healthcare domain are rapidly arising, with a growing discussion
regarding the ethical management of their development. In general, ML
healthcare applications crucially require performance, interpretability of
data, and respect for data privacy. The latter is an increasingly debated topic
as commercial cloud computing services become more and more widespread.
Recently, dedicated methods are starting to be developed aiming to protect data
privacy. However, these generally result in a trade-off forcing one to balance
the level of data privacy and the algorithm performance. Here, a Support Vector
Machine (SVM) classifier model is proposed whose training is reformulated into
a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, and adapted to a
neutral atom-based Quantum Processing Unit (QPU). Our final model does not
require anonymization techniques to protect data privacy since the sensitive
data are not needed to be transferred to the cloud-available QPU. Indeed, the
latter is used only during the training phase, hence allowing a future concrete
application in a real-world scenario. Finally, performance and scaling analyses
on a publicly available breast cancer dataset are discussed, both using ideal
and noisy simulations for the training process, and also successfully tested on
a currently available real neutral-atom QPU.


## AI 摘要

人工智能和机器学习在医疗领域的应用快速发展，但数据隐私保护成为关键挑战。本研究提出了一种基于量子处理单元（QPU）的支持向量机（SVM）分类模型，通过将训练过程转化为二次无约束二进制优化（QUBO）问题，实现了无需向云端传输敏感数据的隐私保护方案。该模型仅在训练阶段使用QPU，避免了传统匿名化技术的性能折衷问题。研究在公开乳腺癌数据集上进行了性能和扩展性分析，包括理想和噪声模拟训练，并成功在实际中性原子QPU上进行了测试，为医疗AI应用提供了可行的隐私保护解决方案。
