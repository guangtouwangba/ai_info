# SlideItRight: Using AI to Find Relevant Slides and Provide Feedback for Open-Ended Questions

## 原始摘要

Feedback is important in supporting student learning. While various automated
feedback systems have been implemented to make the feedback scalable, many
existing solutions only focus on generating text-based feedback. As is
indicated in the multimedia learning principle, learning with more modalities
could help utilize more separate channels, reduce the cognitive load and
facilitate students' learning. Hence, it is important to explore the potential
of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in feedback generation from and to different
modalities. Our study leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for textual
feedback with the supplementary guidance from other modality - relevant lecture
slide retrieved from the slides hub. Through an online crowdsourcing study
(N=91), this study investigates learning gains and student perceptions using a
2x2 design (i.e., human feedback vs. AI feedback and with vs. without relevant
slide), evaluating the clarity, engagement, perceived effectiveness, and
reliability) of AI-facilitated multimodal feedback. We observed significant
pre-to-post learning gains across all conditions. However, the differences in
these gains were not statistically significant between conditions. The
post-survey revealed that students found the slide feedback helpful in their
learning process, though they reported difficulty in understanding it.
Regarding the AI-generated open-ended feedback, students considered it
personalized and relevant to their responses, but they expressed lower trust in
the AI feedback compared to human-generated feedback.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了AI生成多模态反馈对学习的影响，结合文本反馈与相关幻灯片辅助。通过91人实验比较人工与AI反馈（含/不含幻灯片），发现所有条件下学习效果均有提升，但组间差异不显著。学生认为幻灯片反馈有助学习但理解存在困难，AI文本反馈虽具个性化和相关性，但信任度低于人工反馈。研究验证了多媒体学习原则中多通道反馈的价值，同时揭示了AI反馈在可信度方面的局限性。结果表明，多模态AI反馈系统需进一步优化信息呈现方式并提升可信度，以更好支持学生学习。
