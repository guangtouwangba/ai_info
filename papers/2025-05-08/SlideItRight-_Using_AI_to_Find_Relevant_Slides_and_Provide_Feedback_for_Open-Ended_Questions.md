# SlideItRight: Using AI to Find Relevant Slides and Provide Feedback for Open-Ended Questions

## 原始摘要

Feedback is important in supporting student learning. While various automated
feedback systems have been implemented to make the feedback scalable, many
existing solutions only focus on generating text-based feedback. As is
indicated in the multimedia learning principle, learning with more modalities
could help utilize more separate channels, reduce the cognitive load and
facilitate students' learning. Hence, it is important to explore the potential
of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in feedback generation from and to different
modalities. Our study leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for textual
feedback with the supplementary guidance from other modality - relevant lecture
slide retrieved from the slides hub. Through an online crowdsourcing study
(N=91), this study investigates learning gains and student perceptions using a
2x2 design (i.e., human feedback vs. AI feedback and with vs. without relevant
slide), evaluating the clarity, engagement, perceived effectiveness, and
reliability) of AI-facilitated multimodal feedback. We observed significant
pre-to-post learning gains across all conditions. However, the differences in
these gains were not statistically significant between conditions. The
post-survey revealed that students found the slide feedback helpful in their
learning process, though they reported difficulty in understanding it.
Regarding the AI-generated open-ended feedback, students considered it
personalized and relevant to their responses, but they expressed lower trust in
the AI feedback compared to human-generated feedback.


## AI 摘要

研究表明，人工智能（AI）结合多模态反馈（如文本+幻灯片）能提升学习效果。通过91人的实验发现，AI生成的多模态反馈（文本+相关幻灯片）虽未显著提高学习收益，但学生认为幻灯片辅助有帮助（尽管理解存在难度）。AI生成的文本反馈被评价为个性化和相关，但学生对AI反馈的信任度低于人工反馈。实验证实所有反馈形式均带来显著学习提升，但不同条件间差异不显著。这凸显了AI多模态反馈的潜力，也揭示了需优化幻灯片呈现方式并提高AI可信度的改进方向。（99字）
