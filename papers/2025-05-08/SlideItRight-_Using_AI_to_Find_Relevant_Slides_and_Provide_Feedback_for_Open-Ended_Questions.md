# SlideItRight: Using AI to Find Relevant Slides and Provide Feedback for Open-Ended Questions

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04584v1

## 原始摘要

Feedback is important in supporting student learning. While various automated
feedback systems have been implemented to make the feedback scalable, many
existing solutions only focus on generating text-based feedback. As is
indicated in the multimedia learning principle, learning with more modalities
could help utilize more separate channels, reduce the cognitive load and
facilitate students' learning. Hence, it is important to explore the potential
of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in feedback generation from and to different
modalities. Our study leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for textual
feedback with the supplementary guidance from other modality - relevant lecture
slide retrieved from the slides hub. Through an online crowdsourcing study
(N=91), this study investigates learning gains and student perceptions using a
2x2 design (i.e., human feedback vs. AI feedback and with vs. without relevant
slide), evaluating the clarity, engagement, perceived effectiveness, and
reliability) of AI-facilitated multimodal feedback. We observed significant
pre-to-post learning gains across all conditions. However, the differences in
these gains were not statistically significant between conditions. The
post-survey revealed that students found the slide feedback helpful in their
learning process, though they reported difficulty in understanding it.
Regarding the AI-generated open-ended feedback, students considered it
personalized and relevant to their responses, but they expressed lower trust in
the AI feedback compared to human-generated feedback.


## AI 摘要

研究表明，人工智能（AI）结合多模态反馈（如文本+幻灯片）能辅助学生学习。通过大语言模型（LLM）生成文本反馈并辅以相关课件幻灯片，实验（N=91）发现所有反馈形式均带来显著学习提升，但不同条件间无显著差异。学生认为幻灯片辅助有助于学习，但理解存在困难；AI生成的开放式反馈被认为个性化和相关，但信任度低于人工反馈。该研究凸显了AI多模态反馈的潜力，但也指出需提升内容可理解性和用户信任度。
