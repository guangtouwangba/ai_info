# SlideItRight: Using AI to Find Relevant Slides and Provide Feedback for Open-Ended Questions

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04584v1

## 原始摘要

Feedback is important in supporting student learning. While various automated
feedback systems have been implemented to make the feedback scalable, many
existing solutions only focus on generating text-based feedback. As is
indicated in the multimedia learning principle, learning with more modalities
could help utilize more separate channels, reduce the cognitive load and
facilitate students' learning. Hence, it is important to explore the potential
of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in feedback generation from and to different
modalities. Our study leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for textual
feedback with the supplementary guidance from other modality - relevant lecture
slide retrieved from the slides hub. Through an online crowdsourcing study
(N=91), this study investigates learning gains and student perceptions using a
2x2 design (i.e., human feedback vs. AI feedback and with vs. without relevant
slide), evaluating the clarity, engagement, perceived effectiveness, and
reliability) of AI-facilitated multimodal feedback. We observed significant
pre-to-post learning gains across all conditions. However, the differences in
these gains were not statistically significant between conditions. The
post-survey revealed that students found the slide feedback helpful in their
learning process, though they reported difficulty in understanding it.
Regarding the AI-generated open-ended feedback, students considered it
personalized and relevant to their responses, but they expressed lower trust in
the AI feedback compared to human-generated feedback.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了人工智能（AI）在多模态反馈中的潜力，利用大语言模型（LLM）生成文本反馈，并辅以相关课程幻灯片作为补充。通过一项在线众包实验（N=91），采用2x2设计（人工反馈 vs. AI反馈，有 vs. 无幻灯片），评估了学生对反馈的清晰度、参与度、感知效果和可靠性的看法。结果显示所有条件下学生均有显著学习提升，但组间差异不显著。学生认为幻灯片反馈对学习有帮助但理解困难，AI生成的开放式反馈虽被认为个性化和相关，但信任度低于人工反馈。
