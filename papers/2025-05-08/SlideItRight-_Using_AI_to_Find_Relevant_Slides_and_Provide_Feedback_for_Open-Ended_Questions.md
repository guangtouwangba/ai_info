# SlideItRight: Using AI to Find Relevant Slides and Provide Feedback for Open-Ended Questions

## 原始摘要

Feedback is important in supporting student learning. While various automated
feedback systems have been implemented to make the feedback scalable, many
existing solutions only focus on generating text-based feedback. As is
indicated in the multimedia learning principle, learning with more modalities
could help utilize more separate channels, reduce the cognitive load and
facilitate students' learning. Hence, it is important to explore the potential
of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in feedback generation from and to different
modalities. Our study leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for textual
feedback with the supplementary guidance from other modality - relevant lecture
slide retrieved from the slides hub. Through an online crowdsourcing study
(N=91), this study investigates learning gains and student perceptions using a
2x2 design (i.e., human feedback vs. AI feedback and with vs. without relevant
slide), evaluating the clarity, engagement, perceived effectiveness, and
reliability) of AI-facilitated multimodal feedback. We observed significant
pre-to-post learning gains across all conditions. However, the differences in
these gains were not statistically significant between conditions. The
post-survey revealed that students found the slide feedback helpful in their
learning process, though they reported difficulty in understanding it.
Regarding the AI-generated open-ended feedback, students considered it
personalized and relevant to their responses, but they expressed lower trust in
the AI feedback compared to human-generated feedback.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了人工智能（AI）在多模态反馈中的应用，通过结合大语言模型（LLM）生成的文本反馈和相关课程幻灯片来提升学习效果。一项在线实验（N=91）采用2x2设计（人工反馈 vs. AI反馈，有 vs. 无幻灯片），评估了反馈的清晰度、参与度和可信度。结果显示，所有条件下学习效果均有显著提升，但组间差异不显著。学生认为幻灯片反馈对学习有帮助但理解较难，AI反馈虽具个性化和相关性，但信任度低于人工反馈。研究强调了多模态反馈的潜力及其优化方向。
