# AI Governance to Avoid Extinction: The Strategic Landscape and Actionable Research Questions

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04592v1

## 原始摘要

Humanity appears to be on course to soon develop AI systems that
substantially outperform human experts in all cognitive domains and activities.
We believe the default trajectory has a high likelihood of catastrophe,
including human extinction. Risks come from failure to control powerful AI
systems, misuse of AI by malicious rogue actors, war between great powers, and
authoritarian lock-in. This research agenda has two aims: to describe the
strategic landscape of AI development and to catalog important governance
research questions. These questions, if answered, would provide important
insight on how to successfully reduce catastrophic risks.
  We describe four high-level scenarios for the geopolitical response to
advanced AI development, cataloging the research questions most relevant to
each. Our favored scenario involves building the technical, legal, and
institutional infrastructure required to internationally restrict dangerous AI
development and deployment (which we refer to as an Off Switch), which leads
into an internationally coordinated Halt on frontier AI activities at some
point in the future. The second scenario we describe is a US National Project
for AI, in which the US Government races to develop advanced AI systems and
establish unilateral control over global AI development. We also describe two
additional scenarios: a Light-Touch world similar to that of today and a Threat
of Sabotage situation where countries use sabotage and deterrence to slow AI
development.
  In our view, apart from the Off Switch and Halt scenario, all of these
trajectories appear to carry an unacceptable risk of catastrophic harm. Urgent
action is needed from the US National Security community and AI governance
ecosystem to answer key research questions, build the capability to halt
dangerous AI activities, and prepare for international AI agreements.


## AI 摘要

人工智能的快速发展可能带来灾难性风险，包括失控、恶意滥用、大国冲突和威权锁定。研究提出四种应对方案：1) 国际协作建立"紧急停止"机制并暂停前沿AI开发（最优方案）；2) 美国主导的AI国家项目；3) 维持现状的轻监管模式；4) 通过破坏威慑延缓AI发展。除第一种方案外，其他路径都可能造成不可接受的风险。当前亟需美国国家安全机构和AI治理生态系统采取紧急行动，解答关键研究问题，建立阻止危险AI活动的能力，并为国际AI协议做准备。
