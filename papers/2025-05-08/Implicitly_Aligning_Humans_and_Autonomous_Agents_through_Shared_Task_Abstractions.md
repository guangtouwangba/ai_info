# Implicitly Aligning Humans and Autonomous Agents through Shared Task Abstractions

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04579v1

## 原始摘要

In collaborative tasks, autonomous agents fall short of humans in their
capability to quickly adapt to new and unfamiliar teammates. We posit that a
limiting factor for zero-shot coordination is the lack of shared task
abstractions, a mechanism humans rely on to implicitly align with teammates. To
address this gap, we introduce HA$^2$: Hierarchical Ad Hoc Agents, a framework
leveraging hierarchical reinforcement learning to mimic the structured approach
humans use in collaboration. We evaluate HA$^2$ in the Overcooked environment,
demonstrating statistically significant improvement over existing baselines
when paired with both unseen agents and humans, providing better resilience to
environmental shifts, and outperforming all state-of-the-art methods.


## AI 摘要

HA$^2$ (Hierarchical Ad Hoc Agents) is a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework designed to improve autonomous agents' zero-shot coordination with unfamiliar teammates by mimicking human-like task abstractions. Tested in the Overcooked environment, HA$^2$ significantly outperforms existing baselines when collaborating with unseen agents and humans, showing greater adaptability to environmental changes and surpassing state-of-the-art methods. This approach addresses the lack of shared task abstractions, a key limitation in current agent coordination.
