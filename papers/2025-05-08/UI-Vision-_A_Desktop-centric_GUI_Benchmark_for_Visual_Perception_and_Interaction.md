# UI-Vision: A Desktop-centric GUI Benchmark for Visual Perception and Interaction

## 原始摘要

Autonomous agents that navigate Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) to automate
tasks like document editing and file management can greatly enhance computer
workflows. While existing research focuses on online settings, desktop
environments, critical for many professional and everyday tasks, remain
underexplored due to data collection challenges and licensing issues. We
introduce UI-Vision, the first comprehensive, license-permissive benchmark for
offline, fine-grained evaluation of computer use agents in real-world desktop
environments. Unlike online benchmarks, UI-Vision provides: (i) dense,
high-quality annotations of human demonstrations, including bounding boxes, UI
labels, and action trajectories (clicks, drags, and keyboard inputs) across 83
software applications, and (ii) three fine-to-coarse grained tasks-Element
Grounding, Layout Grounding, and Action Prediction-with well-defined metrics to
rigorously evaluate agents' performance in desktop environments. Our evaluation
reveals critical limitations in state-of-the-art models like UI-TARS-72B,
including issues with understanding professional software, spatial reasoning,
and complex actions like drag-and-drop. These findings highlight the challenges
in developing fully autonomous computer use agents. By releasing UI-Vision as
open-source, we aim to advance the development of more capable agents for
real-world desktop tasks.


## AI 摘要

UI-Vision是首个针对桌面环境的综合性开源基准测试工具，用于离线评估GUI自动化代理。它包含83款软件的高质量人工标注（边界框、UI标签和操作轨迹）以及三项精细任务（元素定位、布局定位和动作预测），以严格评估代理性能。研究发现，即使是UI-TARS-72B等先进模型在专业软件理解、空间推理和拖拽等复杂操作上仍存在明显缺陷。该基准的发布旨在推动开发更强大的桌面任务自动化代理，解决现有研究因数据收集和许可问题对桌面环境关注不足的现状。
