# Demonstrating ViSafe: Vision-enabled Safety for High-speed Detect and Avoid

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03694v1

## 原始摘要

Assured safe-separation is essential for achieving seamless high-density
operation of airborne vehicles in a shared airspace. To equip
resource-constrained aerial systems with this safety-critical capability, we
present ViSafe, a high-speed vision-only airborne collision avoidance system.
ViSafe offers a full-stack solution to the Detect and Avoid (DAA) problem by
tightly integrating a learning-based edge-AI framework with a custom
multi-camera hardware prototype designed under SWaP-C constraints. By
leveraging perceptual input-focused control barrier functions (CBF) to design,
encode, and enforce safety thresholds, ViSafe can provide provably safe runtime
guarantees for self-separation in high-speed aerial operations. We evaluate
ViSafe's performance through an extensive test campaign involving both
simulated digital twins and real-world flight scenarios. By independently
varying agent types, closure rates, interaction geometries, and environmental
conditions (e.g., weather and lighting), we demonstrate that ViSafe
consistently ensures self-separation across diverse scenarios. In
first-of-its-kind real-world high-speed collision avoidance tests with closure
rates reaching 144 km/h, ViSafe sets a new benchmark for vision-only autonomous
collision avoidance, establishing a new standard for safety in high-speed
aerial navigation.


## AI 摘要

ViSafe是一种高速纯视觉防撞系统，旨在为资源受限的飞行器提供安全关键的自分离能力。该系统将基于学习的边缘AI框架与轻量化多摄像头硬件原型深度集成，利用感知输入导向的控制屏障函数（CBF）来设计、编码和执行安全阈值，为高速飞行提供可验证的运行时安全保障。通过数字孪生仿真和真实飞行场景测试（包括144公里/小时接近速度的首次实机高速避撞验证），ViSafe在不同飞行器类型、接近速度、交互几何和环境条件（如天气和光照）下均能确保自分离，树立了纯视觉自主避撞的新标杆。
