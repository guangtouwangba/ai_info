# Perpetuating Misogyny with Generative AI: How Model Personalization Normalizes Gendered Harm

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04600v1

## 原始摘要

Open-source text-to-image (TTI) pipelines have become dominant in the
landscape of AI-generated visual content, driven by technological advances that
enable users to personalize models through adapters tailored to specific tasks.
While personalization methods such as LoRA offer unprecedented creative
opportunities, they also facilitate harmful practices, including the generation
of non-consensual deepfakes and the amplification of misogynistic or
hypersexualized content. This study presents an exploratory sociotechnical
analysis of CivitAI, the most active platform for sharing and developing
open-source TTI models. Drawing on a dataset of more than 40 million
user-generated images and over 230,000 models, we find a disproportionate rise
in not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content and a significant number of models intended
to mimic real individuals. We also observe a strong influence of internet
subcultures on the tools and practices shaping model personalizations and
resulting visual media. In response to these findings, we contextualize the
emergence of exploitative visual media through feminist and constructivist
perspectives on technology, emphasizing how design choices and community
dynamics shape platform outcomes. Building on this analysis, we propose
interventions aimed at mitigating downstream harm, including improved content
moderation, rethinking tool design, and establishing clearer platform policies
to promote accountability and consent.


## AI 摘要

开源文本到图像（TTI）技术因适配器个性化定制而快速发展，但CivitAI平台的数据分析显示，其内容生态存在显著问题：40万用户图片和23万模型中，NSFW内容激增，且大量模型用于模仿真人。互联网亚文化深刻影响模型个性化工具和实践，助长了非自愿深度伪造和性别歧视内容。研究从女性主义和建构主义视角指出平台设计选择与社区动态的负面影响，并提出改进建议：加强内容审核、优化工具设计、制定明确政策以提升责任意识和用户同意机制。该研究揭示了TTI技术滥用与社会伦理风险。
