# Perpetuating Misogyny with Generative AI: How Model Personalization Normalizes Gendered Harm

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04600v1

## 原始摘要

Open-source text-to-image (TTI) pipelines have become dominant in the
landscape of AI-generated visual content, driven by technological advances that
enable users to personalize models through adapters tailored to specific tasks.
While personalization methods such as LoRA offer unprecedented creative
opportunities, they also facilitate harmful practices, including the generation
of non-consensual deepfakes and the amplification of misogynistic or
hypersexualized content. This study presents an exploratory sociotechnical
analysis of CivitAI, the most active platform for sharing and developing
open-source TTI models. Drawing on a dataset of more than 40 million
user-generated images and over 230,000 models, we find a disproportionate rise
in not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content and a significant number of models intended
to mimic real individuals. We also observe a strong influence of internet
subcultures on the tools and practices shaping model personalizations and
resulting visual media. In response to these findings, we contextualize the
emergence of exploitative visual media through feminist and constructivist
perspectives on technology, emphasizing how design choices and community
dynamics shape platform outcomes. Building on this analysis, we propose
interventions aimed at mitigating downstream harm, including improved content
moderation, rethinking tool design, and establishing clearer platform policies
to promote accountability and consent.


## AI 摘要

开源文本生成图像(TTI)技术通过适配器实现个性化定制，推动了AI生成视觉内容的普及。研究分析了最大开源TTI平台CivitAI的4000万用户生成图片和23万模型数据，发现平台存在两大问题：一是NSFW内容激增，二是大量模仿真实人物的模型涌现。研究指出互联网亚文化深刻影响着模型个性化工具和实践。基于女权主义和建构主义视角，研究揭示了平台设计选择和社区动态如何导致剥削性视觉内容产生。为此，研究建议采取改进内容审核、重新设计工具、制定更清晰平台政策等干预措施，以减少潜在危害。
