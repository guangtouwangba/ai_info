# Perpetuating Misogyny with Generative AI: How Model Personalization Normalizes Gendered Harm

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04600v1

## 原始摘要

Open-source text-to-image (TTI) pipelines have become dominant in the
landscape of AI-generated visual content, driven by technological advances that
enable users to personalize models through adapters tailored to specific tasks.
While personalization methods such as LoRA offer unprecedented creative
opportunities, they also facilitate harmful practices, including the generation
of non-consensual deepfakes and the amplification of misogynistic or
hypersexualized content. This study presents an exploratory sociotechnical
analysis of CivitAI, the most active platform for sharing and developing
open-source TTI models. Drawing on a dataset of more than 40 million
user-generated images and over 230,000 models, we find a disproportionate rise
in not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content and a significant number of models intended
to mimic real individuals. We also observe a strong influence of internet
subcultures on the tools and practices shaping model personalizations and
resulting visual media. In response to these findings, we contextualize the
emergence of exploitative visual media through feminist and constructivist
perspectives on technology, emphasizing how design choices and community
dynamics shape platform outcomes. Building on this analysis, we propose
interventions aimed at mitigating downstream harm, including improved content
moderation, rethinking tool design, and establishing clearer platform policies
to promote accountability and consent.


## AI 摘要

该研究对开源文本生成图像（TTI）平台CivitAI进行了社会技术分析，发现平台存在大量不安全内容（NSFW）和模仿真人的模型，且互联网亚文化显著影响了模型个性化及生成内容。基于超过40万用户生成图片和23万模型的数据，研究指出当前技术虽带来创造力，但也助长了非自愿深度伪造和性别歧视等有害行为。从女性主义和建构主义视角，作者强调平台设计及社区动态对内容的影响，并提出改进内容审核、工具设计和平台政策等干预措施，以减少潜在危害并增强责任与同意意识。
