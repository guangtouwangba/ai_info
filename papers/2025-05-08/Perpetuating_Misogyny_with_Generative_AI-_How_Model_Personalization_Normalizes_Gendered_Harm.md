# Perpetuating Misogyny with Generative AI: How Model Personalization Normalizes Gendered Harm

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04600v1

## 原始摘要

Open-source text-to-image (TTI) pipelines have become dominant in the
landscape of AI-generated visual content, driven by technological advances that
enable users to personalize models through adapters tailored to specific tasks.
While personalization methods such as LoRA offer unprecedented creative
opportunities, they also facilitate harmful practices, including the generation
of non-consensual deepfakes and the amplification of misogynistic or
hypersexualized content. This study presents an exploratory sociotechnical
analysis of CivitAI, the most active platform for sharing and developing
open-source TTI models. Drawing on a dataset of more than 40 million
user-generated images and over 230,000 models, we find a disproportionate rise
in not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content and a significant number of models intended
to mimic real individuals. We also observe a strong influence of internet
subcultures on the tools and practices shaping model personalizations and
resulting visual media. In response to these findings, we contextualize the
emergence of exploitative visual media through feminist and constructivist
perspectives on technology, emphasizing how design choices and community
dynamics shape platform outcomes. Building on this analysis, we propose
interventions aimed at mitigating downstream harm, including improved content
moderation, rethinking tool design, and establishing clearer platform policies
to promote accountability and consent.


## AI 摘要

开源文本生成图像（TTI）技术因适配器个性化定制功能迅速发展，但同时也助长了非自愿深度伪造和性别歧视等有害内容。本研究分析了主流开源TTI平台CivitAI，发现其4000万用户生成图片中NSFW内容激增，23万个模型存在模仿真人现象，且网络亚文化显著影响模型定制。研究从女性主义和技术建构主义视角指出平台设计选择与社区生态的负面影响，并提出改进内容审核、工具设计和平台政策等干预措施，以增强责任意识与用户同意机制。
