# On Path to Multimodal Generalist: General-Level and General-Bench

## 原始摘要

The Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) is currently experiencing rapid
growth, driven by the advanced capabilities of LLMs. Unlike earlier
specialists, existing MLLMs are evolving towards a Multimodal Generalist
paradigm. Initially limited to understanding multiple modalities, these models
have advanced to not only comprehend but also generate across modalities. Their
capabilities have expanded from coarse-grained to fine-grained multimodal
understanding and from supporting limited modalities to arbitrary ones. While
many benchmarks exist to assess MLLMs, a critical question arises: Can we
simply assume that higher performance across tasks indicates a stronger MLLM
capability, bringing us closer to human-level AI? We argue that the answer is
not as straightforward as it seems. This project introduces General-Level, an
evaluation framework that defines 5-scale levels of MLLM performance and
generality, offering a methodology to compare MLLMs and gauge the progress of
existing systems towards more robust multimodal generalists and, ultimately,
towards AGI. At the core of the framework is the concept of Synergy, which
measures whether models maintain consistent capabilities across comprehension
and generation, and across multiple modalities. To support this evaluation, we
present General-Bench, which encompasses a broader spectrum of skills,
modalities, formats, and capabilities, including over 700 tasks and 325,800
instances. The evaluation results that involve over 100 existing
state-of-the-art MLLMs uncover the capability rankings of generalists,
highlighting the challenges in reaching genuine AI. We expect this project to
pave the way for future research on next-generation multimodal foundation
models, providing a robust infrastructure to accelerate the realization of AGI.

## AI 摘要

多模态大语言模型(MLLM)正在向通用人工智能(AGI)方向发展，从最初仅能理解多模态发展到能跨模态生成内容。研究团队提出"General-Level"评估框架，通过5级量表衡量MLLM性能与通用性，并引入"Synergy"概念评估模型在理解与生成、跨模态的一致性表现。配套的General-Bench基准包含700多项任务和32.5万实例，评估了100多个先进MLLM，揭示了当前模型与真正AI的差距。该项目为下一代多模态基础模型研究奠定了基础，有望加速AGI的实现。项目页面：generalist.top
