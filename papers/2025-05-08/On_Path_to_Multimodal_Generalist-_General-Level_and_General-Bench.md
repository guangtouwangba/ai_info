# On Path to Multimodal Generalist: General-Level and General-Bench

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04620v1

## 原始摘要

The Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) is currently experiencing rapid
growth, driven by the advanced capabilities of LLMs. Unlike earlier
specialists, existing MLLMs are evolving towards a Multimodal Generalist
paradigm. Initially limited to understanding multiple modalities, these models
have advanced to not only comprehend but also generate across modalities. Their
capabilities have expanded from coarse-grained to fine-grained multimodal
understanding and from supporting limited modalities to arbitrary ones. While
many benchmarks exist to assess MLLMs, a critical question arises: Can we
simply assume that higher performance across tasks indicates a stronger MLLM
capability, bringing us closer to human-level AI? We argue that the answer is
not as straightforward as it seems. This project introduces General-Level, an
evaluation framework that defines 5-scale levels of MLLM performance and
generality, offering a methodology to compare MLLMs and gauge the progress of
existing systems towards more robust multimodal generalists and, ultimately,
towards AGI. At the core of the framework is the concept of Synergy, which
measures whether models maintain consistent capabilities across comprehension
and generation, and across multiple modalities. To support this evaluation, we
present General-Bench, which encompasses a broader spectrum of skills,
modalities, formats, and capabilities, including over 700 tasks and 325,800
instances. The evaluation results that involve over 100 existing
state-of-the-art MLLMs uncover the capability rankings of generalists,
highlighting the challenges in reaching genuine AI. We expect this project to
pave the way for future research on next-generation multimodal foundation
models, providing a robust infrastructure to accelerate the realization of AGI.

## AI 摘要

多模态大语言模型（MLLM）正快速发展，从单一模态理解向多模态通用范式演进，涵盖理解与生成能力。现有评估方法难以衡量其真实水平。为此，研究团队提出**General-Level**评估框架，定义5级能力标准，并引入**Synergy**概念，检验模型在多模态理解与生成中的一致性。配套的**General-Bench**基准包含700+任务和32.5万实例，覆盖更广技能与模态。通过对100+顶尖MLLM的测试，揭示了当前模型与人类级AI的差距。该项目为下一代多模态基础模型研究奠定基础，推动AGI发展。详情见：https://generalist.top/
