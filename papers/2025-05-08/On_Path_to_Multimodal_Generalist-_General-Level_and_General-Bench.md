# On Path to Multimodal Generalist: General-Level and General-Bench

## 原始摘要

The Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) is currently experiencing rapid
growth, driven by the advanced capabilities of LLMs. Unlike earlier
specialists, existing MLLMs are evolving towards a Multimodal Generalist
paradigm. Initially limited to understanding multiple modalities, these models
have advanced to not only comprehend but also generate across modalities. Their
capabilities have expanded from coarse-grained to fine-grained multimodal
understanding and from supporting limited modalities to arbitrary ones. While
many benchmarks exist to assess MLLMs, a critical question arises: Can we
simply assume that higher performance across tasks indicates a stronger MLLM
capability, bringing us closer to human-level AI? We argue that the answer is
not as straightforward as it seems. This project introduces General-Level, an
evaluation framework that defines 5-scale levels of MLLM performance and
generality, offering a methodology to compare MLLMs and gauge the progress of
existing systems towards more robust multimodal generalists and, ultimately,
towards AGI. At the core of the framework is the concept of Synergy, which
measures whether models maintain consistent capabilities across comprehension
and generation, and across multiple modalities. To support this evaluation, we
present General-Bench, which encompasses a broader spectrum of skills,
modalities, formats, and capabilities, including over 700 tasks and 325,800
instances. The evaluation results that involve over 100 existing
state-of-the-art MLLMs uncover the capability rankings of generalists,
highlighting the challenges in reaching genuine AI. We expect this project to
pave the way for future research on next-generation multimodal foundation
models, providing a robust infrastructure to accelerate the realization of AGI.

## AI 摘要

多模态大语言模型(MLLM)正在快速发展，从最初仅能理解多模态内容，到如今具备跨模态理解和生成能力。研究者提出"General-Level"评估框架，通过5级量表衡量MLLM的性能和通用性，并引入"协同性"概念来评估模型在理解和生成任务中的一致性。配套的General-Bench基准包含700多项任务和32.5万实例，覆盖广泛技能和模态。对100多个先进MLLM的评估揭示了当前模型的局限性，为开发更强大的多模态基础模型和实现AGI提供了重要参考。项目网站：https://generalist.top/
