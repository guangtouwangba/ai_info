# Scaling Laws in Scientific Discovery with AI and Robot Scientists

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22444v2

## 原始摘要

Scientific discovery is poised for rapid advancement through advanced
robotics and artificial intelligence. Current scientific practices face
substantial limitations as manual experimentation remains time-consuming and
resource-intensive, while multidisciplinary research demands knowledge
integration beyond individual researchers' expertise boundaries. Here, we
envision an autonomous generalist scientist (AGS) concept combines agentic AI
and embodied robotics to automate the entire research lifecycle. This system
could dynamically interact with both physical and virtual environments while
facilitating the integration of knowledge across diverse scientific
disciplines. By deploying these technologies throughout every research stage --
spanning literature review, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and
manuscript writing -- and incorporating internal reflection alongside external
feedback, this system aims to significantly reduce the time and resources
needed for scientific discovery. Building on the evolution from virtual AI
scientists to versatile generalist AI-based robot scientists, AGS promises
groundbreaking potential. As these autonomous systems become increasingly
integrated into the research process, we hypothesize that scientific discovery
might adhere to new scaling laws, potentially shaped by the number and
capabilities of these autonomous systems, offering novel perspectives on how
knowledge is generated and evolves. The adaptability of embodied robots to
extreme environments, paired with the flywheel effect of accumulating
scientific knowledge, holds the promise of continually pushing beyond both
physical and intellectual frontiers.


## AI 摘要

这篇摘要提出了"自主通用科学家"(AGS)的概念，通过结合智能体和具身机器人技术，实现科研全流程自动化。该系统能动态交互物理和虚拟环境，整合跨学科知识，覆盖文献综述、假设生成、实验和论文撰写等环节，有望大幅减少科研所需时间和资源。从虚拟AI科学家发展到通用型机器人科学家的演进中，AGS展现出突破性潜力。随着这类自主系统深度融入科研，科学发现可能遵循新的扩展定律，其进程或将由自主系统的数量和能力决定。具身机器人对极端环境的适应性与科学知识的累积效应相结合，将持续突破物理和智力边界。
