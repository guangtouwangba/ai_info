## 原始摘要

Large Vision-Language Models offer a new paradigm for AI-driven image
understanding, enabling models to perform tasks without task-specific training.
This flexibility holds particular promise across medicine, where
expert-annotated data is scarce. Yet, VLMs' practical utility in
intervention-focused domains--especially surgery, where decision-making is
subjective and clinical scenarios are variable--remains uncertain. Here, we
present a comprehensive analysis of 11 state-of-the-art VLMs across 17 key
visual understanding tasks in surgical AI--from anatomy recognition to skill
assessment--using 13 datasets spanning laparoscopic, robotic, and open
procedures. In our experiments, VLMs demonstrate promising generalizability, at
times outperforming supervised models when deployed outside their training
setting. In-context learning, incorporating examples during testing, boosted
performance up to three-fold, suggesting adaptability as a key strength. Still,
tasks requiring spatial or temporal reasoning remained difficult. Beyond
surgery, our findings offer insights into VLMs' potential for tackling complex
and dynamic scenarios in clinical and broader real-world applications.


## AI 摘要

大型视觉语言模型(VLMs)为AI驱动的图像理解提供了新范式，无需特定任务训练即可执行任务。在医学领域，尤其是手术场景中，VLMs展现出良好泛化能力，有时甚至超越监督模型。研究表明，上下文学习可将性能提升三倍，体现了模型的适应性优势。然而，需要时空推理的任务仍具挑战性。研究评估了11种先进VLM在17种手术AI任务(从解剖识别到技能评估)的表现，覆盖13种腹腔镜、机器人和开放手术数据集。这些发现不仅对手术AI有重要意义，也为VLM在复杂临床和现实场景的应用提供了参考。
