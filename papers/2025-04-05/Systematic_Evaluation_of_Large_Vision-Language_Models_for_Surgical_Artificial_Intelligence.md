## 原始摘要

Large Vision-Language Models offer a new paradigm for AI-driven image
understanding, enabling models to perform tasks without task-specific training.
This flexibility holds particular promise across medicine, where
expert-annotated data is scarce. Yet, VLMs' practical utility in
intervention-focused domains--especially surgery, where decision-making is
subjective and clinical scenarios are variable--remains uncertain. Here, we
present a comprehensive analysis of 11 state-of-the-art VLMs across 17 key
visual understanding tasks in surgical AI--from anatomy recognition to skill
assessment--using 13 datasets spanning laparoscopic, robotic, and open
procedures. In our experiments, VLMs demonstrate promising generalizability, at
times outperforming supervised models when deployed outside their training
setting. In-context learning, incorporating examples during testing, boosted
performance up to three-fold, suggesting adaptability as a key strength. Still,
tasks requiring spatial or temporal reasoning remained difficult. Beyond
surgery, our findings offer insights into VLMs' potential for tackling complex
and dynamic scenarios in clinical and broader real-world applications.


## AI 摘要

大型视觉语言模型(VLMs)为AI驱动的图像理解提供了新范式，无需任务特定训练即可执行任务。在医学领域，特别是外科手术等决策主观且场景多变的干预性领域，VLMs展现出良好泛化能力，有时甚至超越监督模型。研究表明，上下文学习可使性能提升三倍，适应性是其关键优势。然而，需要空间或时间推理的任务仍具挑战性。通过对11种先进VLM在17个外科AI任务(从解剖识别到技能评估)的全面分析，该研究为VLM在临床及其他复杂动态场景中的应用潜力提供了重要见解。
