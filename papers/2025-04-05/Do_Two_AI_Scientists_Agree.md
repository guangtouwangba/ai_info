# Do Two AI Scientists Agree?

## 原始摘要

When two AI models are trained on the same scientific task, do they learn the
same theory or two different theories? Throughout history of science, we have
witnessed the rise and fall of theories driven by experimental validation or
falsification: many theories may co-exist when experimental data is lacking,
but the space of survived theories become more constrained with more
experimental data becoming available. We show the same story is true for AI
scientists. With increasingly more systems provided in training data, AI
scientists tend to converge in the theories they learned, although sometimes
they form distinct groups corresponding to different theories. To
mechanistically interpret what theories AI scientists learn and quantify their
agreement, we propose MASS, Hamiltonian-Lagrangian neural networks as AI
Scientists, trained on standard problems in physics, aggregating training
results across many seeds simulating the different configurations of AI
scientists. Our findings suggests for AI scientists switch from learning a
Hamiltonian theory in simple setups to a Lagrangian formulation when more
complex systems are introduced. We also observe strong seed dependence of the
training dynamics and final learned weights, controlling the rise and fall of
relevant theories. We finally demonstrate that not only can our neural networks
aid interpretability, it can also be applied to higher dimensional problems.


## AI 摘要

研究表明，当不同AI模型在相同科学任务上训练时，它们可能学习到不同理论，类似于科学史上多种理论并存的现象。随着训练数据增加，AI模型的理论会趋于收敛，但有时仍会形成不同理论分支。研究者提出MASS方法，通过哈密顿-拉格朗日神经网络模拟AI科学家，发现简单系统下AI倾向于学习哈密顿理论，复杂系统则转向拉格朗日理论。训练初始条件（种子）显著影响最终学习结果，决定不同理论的兴衰。该方法不仅能提高可解释性，还可应用于更高维问题。
