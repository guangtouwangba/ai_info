# Spatial segregation across travelling fronts in individual-based and continuum models for the growth of heterogeneous cell populations

## 原始摘要

We consider a partial differential equation model for the growth of
heterogeneous cell populations subdivided into multiple distinct discrete
phenotypes. In this model, cells preferentially move towards regions where they
feel less compressed, and thus their movement occurs down the gradient of the
cellular pressure, which is defined as a weighted sum of the densities (i.e.
the volume fractions) of cells with different phenotypes. To translate into
mathematical terms the idea that cells with distinct phenotypes have different
morphological and mechanical properties, both the cell mobility and the
weighted amount the cells contribute to the cellular pressure vary with their
phenotype. We formally derive this model as the continuum limit of an
on-lattice individual-based model, where cells are represented as single agents
undergoing a branching biased random walk corresponding to phenotype-dependent
and pressure-regulated cell division, death, and movement. Then, we study
travelling wave solutions whereby cells with different phenotypes are spatially
segregated across the invading front. Finally, we report on numerical
simulations of the two models, demonstrating excellent agreement between them
and the travelling wave analysis. The results presented here indicate that
inter-cellular variability in mobility can provide the substrate for the
emergence of spatial segregation across invading cell fronts.

该研究构建了一个描述多表型异质细胞群体生长的偏微分方程模型，其中细胞倾向于向压力较低区域迁移。细胞压力定义为不同表型细胞密度的加权和，且细胞的运动能力和压力贡献权重随表型变化。模型由基于个体的离散模型通过连续极限推导得出，描述了细胞在表型依赖和压力调控下的分裂、死亡和迁移行为。研究发现不同表型细胞在入侵前沿会形成空间分离的传播波，数值模拟验证了离散与连续模型的一致性。结果表明细胞运动能力的差异可能导致入侵前沿的空间隔离现象。
