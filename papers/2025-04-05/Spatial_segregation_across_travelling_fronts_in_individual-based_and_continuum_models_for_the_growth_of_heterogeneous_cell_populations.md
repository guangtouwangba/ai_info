# Spatial segregation across travelling fronts in individual-based and continuum models for the growth of heterogeneous cell populations

## 原始摘要

We consider a partial differential equation model for the growth of
heterogeneous cell populations subdivided into multiple distinct discrete
phenotypes. In this model, cells preferentially move towards regions where they
feel less compressed, and thus their movement occurs down the gradient of the
cellular pressure, which is defined as a weighted sum of the densities (i.e.
the volume fractions) of cells with different phenotypes. To translate into
mathematical terms the idea that cells with distinct phenotypes have different
morphological and mechanical properties, both the cell mobility and the
weighted amount the cells contribute to the cellular pressure vary with their
phenotype. We formally derive this model as the continuum limit of an
on-lattice individual-based model, where cells are represented as single agents
undergoing a branching biased random walk corresponding to phenotype-dependent
and pressure-regulated cell division, death, and movement. Then, we study
travelling wave solutions whereby cells with different phenotypes are spatially
segregated across the invading front. Finally, we report on numerical
simulations of the two models, demonstrating excellent agreement between them
and the travelling wave analysis. The results presented here indicate that
inter-cellular variability in mobility can provide the substrate for the
emergence of spatial segregation across invading cell fronts.

这篇论文研究了一个描述异质性细胞群体生长的偏微分方程模型，将细胞划分为多个不同表型。模型假设细胞会向压缩较小的区域迁移，运动方向沿细胞压力梯度下降。细胞压力定义为各表型密度的加权和，且不同表型的细胞具有不同的运动性和压力贡献权重。研究通过离散个体模型的连续极限推导出该模型，分析了细胞表型在入侵前沿空间分离的行波解，并通过数值模拟验证了模型一致性。结果表明，细胞运动性的差异可能导致入侵细胞前沿出现空间分离现象。
