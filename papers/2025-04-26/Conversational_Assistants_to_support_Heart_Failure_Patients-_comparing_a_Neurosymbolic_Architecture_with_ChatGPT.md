# Conversational Assistants to support Heart Failure Patients: comparing a Neurosymbolic Architecture with ChatGPT

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17753v1

## 原始摘要

Conversational assistants are becoming more and more popular, including in
healthcare, partly because of the availability and capabilities of Large
Language Models. There is a need for controlled, probing evaluations with real
stakeholders which can highlight advantages and disadvantages of more
traditional architectures and those based on generative AI. We present a
within-group user study to compare two versions of a conversational assistant
that allows heart failure patients to ask about salt content in food. One
version of the system was developed in-house with a neurosymbolic architecture,
and one is based on ChatGPT. The evaluation shows that the in-house system is
more accurate, completes more tasks and is less verbose than the one based on
ChatGPT; on the other hand, the one based on ChatGPT makes fewer speech errors
and requires fewer clarifications to complete the task. Patients show no
preference for one over the other.


## AI 摘要

一项研究比较了两种针对心衰患者的对话助手：一种基于神经符号架构的内部开发系统，另一种基于ChatGPT。结果显示，内部系统更准确、任务完成率更高且回答更简洁，而ChatGPT版本在语音错误更少、完成任务所需的澄清更少。然而，患者对两种系统没有明显偏好。该研究强调了生成式AI与传统架构在医疗应用中的优缺点，为相关技术选择提供了参考。
