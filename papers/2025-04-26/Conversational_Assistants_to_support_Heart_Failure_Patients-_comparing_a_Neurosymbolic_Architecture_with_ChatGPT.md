# Conversational Assistants to support Heart Failure Patients: comparing a Neurosymbolic Architecture with ChatGPT

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17753v1

## 原始摘要

Conversational assistants are becoming more and more popular, including in
healthcare, partly because of the availability and capabilities of Large
Language Models. There is a need for controlled, probing evaluations with real
stakeholders which can highlight advantages and disadvantages of more
traditional architectures and those based on generative AI. We present a
within-group user study to compare two versions of a conversational assistant
that allows heart failure patients to ask about salt content in food. One
version of the system was developed in-house with a neurosymbolic architecture,
and one is based on ChatGPT. The evaluation shows that the in-house system is
more accurate, completes more tasks and is less verbose than the one based on
ChatGPT; on the other hand, the one based on ChatGPT makes fewer speech errors
and requires fewer clarifications to complete the task. Patients show no
preference for one over the other.


## AI 摘要

这项研究比较了两种对话助手在心力衰竭患者饮食咨询中的表现：一种是基于神经符号架构的内部系统，另一种基于ChatGPT。结果显示，内部系统更准确、任务完成率更高且回答更简洁，而ChatGPT版本语音错误更少、所需澄清更少。但患者对两者无明显偏好。研究表明，传统架构在特定医疗场景下可能优于生成式AI，但各有优劣，需根据需求权衡选择。研究采用真实用户测试，为医疗对话系统的设计提供了实证依据。（99字）
