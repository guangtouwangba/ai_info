# Conversational Assistants to support Heart Failure Patients: comparing a Neurosymbolic Architecture with ChatGPT

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17753v1

## 原始摘要

Conversational assistants are becoming more and more popular, including in
healthcare, partly because of the availability and capabilities of Large
Language Models. There is a need for controlled, probing evaluations with real
stakeholders which can highlight advantages and disadvantages of more
traditional architectures and those based on generative AI. We present a
within-group user study to compare two versions of a conversational assistant
that allows heart failure patients to ask about salt content in food. One
version of the system was developed in-house with a neurosymbolic architecture,
and one is based on ChatGPT. The evaluation shows that the in-house system is
more accurate, completes more tasks and is less verbose than the one based on
ChatGPT; on the other hand, the one based on ChatGPT makes fewer speech errors
and requires fewer clarifications to complete the task. Patients show no
preference for one over the other.


## AI 摘要

本研究比较了两种面向心衰患者的对话助手：一种基于神经符号架构开发，另一种基于ChatGPT。结果显示，自研系统在准确性、任务完成率和简洁性上优于ChatGPT版本，但ChatGPT版本在语音错误率和任务澄清需求方面表现更好。两种系统在患者偏好方面没有显著差异。该研究为医疗领域对话系统的设计提供了实证参考，表明传统架构与生成式AI各有优劣。
