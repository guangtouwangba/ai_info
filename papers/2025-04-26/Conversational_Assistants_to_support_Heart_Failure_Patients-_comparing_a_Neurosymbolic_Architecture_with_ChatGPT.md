# Conversational Assistants to support Heart Failure Patients: comparing a Neurosymbolic Architecture with ChatGPT

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17753v1

## 原始摘要

Conversational assistants are becoming more and more popular, including in
healthcare, partly because of the availability and capabilities of Large
Language Models. There is a need for controlled, probing evaluations with real
stakeholders which can highlight advantages and disadvantages of more
traditional architectures and those based on generative AI. We present a
within-group user study to compare two versions of a conversational assistant
that allows heart failure patients to ask about salt content in food. One
version of the system was developed in-house with a neurosymbolic architecture,
and one is based on ChatGPT. The evaluation shows that the in-house system is
more accurate, completes more tasks and is less verbose than the one based on
ChatGPT; on the other hand, the one based on ChatGPT makes fewer speech errors
and requires fewer clarifications to complete the task. Patients show no
preference for one over the other.


## AI 摘要

本研究比较了两种面向心衰患者的饮食问答对话系统：一种基于神经符号架构的自主研发系统，另一种基于ChatGPT。结果显示，自研系统在准确性、任务完成率和简洁性方面表现更优，而ChatGPT系统在语音错误率和所需澄清次数上更少。不过，患者对两种系统没有表现出明显偏好。该研究通过真实用户测试，揭示了传统架构与生成式AI系统各自的优劣势，为医疗领域对话助手的发展提供了实证参考。研究强调了对不同技术方案进行对比评估的重要性。（99字）
