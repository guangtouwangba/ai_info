# The Role of Prescreening in Auctions with Predictions

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12117v2

## 原始摘要

Auctioneers often use closed auctions to create scarcity and prestige, aiming
to intensify competition among a select group of high-status bidders. Advances
in machine learning and AI make this strategy increasingly viable, enabling
cost-effective identification of capable participants. In this paper, we
develop a theoretical model to assess whether such practice can be justified
from an economic perspective. We consider a setting in which bidders have
i.i.d. private valuations, and the auction designer observes a noisy predictor
of each bidder's valuation, which is assumed to be fully informative with some
probability. Based on this noisy predictor, the designer determines how many
bidders to admit -- a process we refer to as prescreening. We show that an
auction with prescreening is equivalent to a standard auction (i.e., without
prescreening) in which bidder valuations are correlated. Notably, the standard
notion of affiliation commonly assumed in the auction literature does not
generally hold in this equivalent formulation. We characterize conditions for
the existence of symmetric and strictly monotone equilibrium strategies across
three classical auction formats: all-pay, first-price, and second-price
auctions. Our results demonstrate that prescreening with noisy predictors can
significantly enhance revenue in all-pay auctions; in fact, with a perfect
predictor, admitting only two bidders is optimal. By contrast, in both
first-price and second-price auctions, admitting all bidders remains
revenue-maximizing.


## AI 摘要

拍卖行常采用封闭拍卖制造稀缺性和声望，以刺激高价值竞标者的竞争。本研究通过理论模型分析，探讨基于机器学习预筛选手的经济合理性。模型假设竞标者估值独立同分布，拍卖方通过噪声预测器筛选参与者。研究表明：预筛选拍卖等同于标准拍卖中的关联估值模型，但不符合传统关联性假设。在三种拍卖形式中，全支付拍卖通过预筛选能显著提升收益（完美预测时仅需2名竞标者）；而第一价格和第二价格拍卖则保持全员参与最有利。研究揭示了不同拍卖机制下信息筛选的差异化收益效应。
