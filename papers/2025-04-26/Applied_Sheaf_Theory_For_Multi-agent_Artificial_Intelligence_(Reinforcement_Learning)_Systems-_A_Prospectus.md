# Applied Sheaf Theory For Multi-agent Artificial Intelligence (Reinforcement Learning) Systems: A Prospectus

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17700v1

## 原始摘要

This paper provides a pedagogical introduction to classical sheaf theory and
sheaf cohomology, followed by a research prospectus exploring potential
applications to multi-agent artificial intelligence systems. The first section
offers a comprehensive overview of fundamental sheaf-theoretic
concepts-presheaves, sheaves, stalks, and cohomology-aimed at researchers in
computer science and AI who may not have extensive background in algebraic
topology. The second section presents a detailed research prospectus that
outlines a roadmap for developing sheaf-theoretic approaches to model and
analyze complex systems of interacting agents. We propose that sheaf theory's
inherent local-to-global perspective may provide valuable mathematical tools
for reasoning about how local agent behaviors collectively determine emergent
system properties. The third section contains a literature review connecting
sheaf theory with existing research in multi-agent systems, reinforcement
learning, and economic modeling. This paper does not present a completed model
but rather lays theoretical groundwork and identifies promising research
directions that could bridge abstract mathematics with practical AI
applications, potentially revealing new approaches to coordination and
emergence in multi-agent systems.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文首先对经典的层理论（sheaf theory）和层上同调（sheaf cohomology）进行了教学式介绍，面向缺乏代数拓扑背景的计算机科学和AI研究者。随后提出了一个研究展望，探讨层理论在多智能体人工智能系统中的潜在应用。作者认为层理论"从局部到整体"的视角可为分析智能体局部行为如何涌现系统全局特性提供数学工具。论文还综述了层理论与多智能体系统、强化学习和经济建模的现有研究关联。全文旨在建立理论基础并指明研究方向，而非提出完整模型，试图搭建抽象数学与AI实践之间的桥梁。
