# Applied Sheaf Theory For Multi-agent Artificial Intelligence (Reinforcement Learning) Systems: A Prospectus

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17700v1

## 原始摘要

This paper provides a pedagogical introduction to classical sheaf theory and
sheaf cohomology, followed by a research prospectus exploring potential
applications to multi-agent artificial intelligence systems. The first section
offers a comprehensive overview of fundamental sheaf-theoretic
concepts-presheaves, sheaves, stalks, and cohomology-aimed at researchers in
computer science and AI who may not have extensive background in algebraic
topology. The second section presents a detailed research prospectus that
outlines a roadmap for developing sheaf-theoretic approaches to model and
analyze complex systems of interacting agents. We propose that sheaf theory's
inherent local-to-global perspective may provide valuable mathematical tools
for reasoning about how local agent behaviors collectively determine emergent
system properties. The third section contains a literature review connecting
sheaf theory with existing research in multi-agent systems, reinforcement
learning, and economic modeling. This paper does not present a completed model
but rather lays theoretical groundwork and identifies promising research
directions that could bridge abstract mathematics with practical AI
applications, potentially revealing new approaches to coordination and
emergence in multi-agent systems.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文首先介绍了经典的层论和层上同调理论，为计算机科学和AI领域的研究者提供了基础概念的教学内容。随后提出了一个研究展望，探讨层论在多智能体人工智能系统中的潜在应用。作者认为层论固有的"局部到全局"视角可为分析智能体局部行为如何共同决定系统涌现特性提供数学工具。论文还综述了层论与多智能体系统、强化学习和经济建模等领域现有研究的联系。虽然未提出完整模型，但为连接抽象数学与AI实际应用奠定了理论基础，并指出了可能带来多智能体系统协调与涌现新方法的研究方向。
