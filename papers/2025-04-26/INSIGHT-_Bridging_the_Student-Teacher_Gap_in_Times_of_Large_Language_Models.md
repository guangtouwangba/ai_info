# INSIGHT: Bridging the Student-Teacher Gap in Times of Large Language Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17677v1

## 原始摘要

The rise of AI, especially Large Language Models, presents challenges and
opportunities to integrate such technology into the classroom. AI has the
potential to revolutionize education by helping teaching staff with various
tasks, such as personalizing their teaching methods, but it also raises
concerns, for example, about the degradation of student-teacher interactions
and user privacy. This paper introduces INSIGHT, a proof of concept to combine
various AI tools to assist teaching staff and students in the process of
solving exercises. INSIGHT has a modular design that allows it to be integrated
into various higher education courses. We analyze students' questions to an LLM
by extracting keywords, which we use to dynamically build an FAQ from students'
questions and provide new insights for the teaching staff to use for more
personalized face-to-face support. Future work could build upon INSIGHT by
using the collected data to provide adaptive learning and adjust content based
on student progress and learning styles to offer a more interactive and
inclusive learning experience.


## AI 摘要

大型语言模型（LLM）等AI技术为教育领域带来机遇与挑战，既能帮助教师实现个性化教学，也可能影响师生互动和隐私保护。研究提出模块化系统INSIGHT，通过整合多种AI工具辅助师生解题：提取学生提问关键词构建动态FAQ，同时为教师提供个性化面授的参考依据。未来可基于收集的数据开发自适应学习功能，根据学生进度和风格调整内容，打造更具交互性和包容性的学习体验。该系统设计适用于高等教育多课程场景，展现了AI赋能教育的可行路径。
