# INSIGHT: Bridging the Student-Teacher Gap in Times of Large Language Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17677v1

## 原始摘要

The rise of AI, especially Large Language Models, presents challenges and
opportunities to integrate such technology into the classroom. AI has the
potential to revolutionize education by helping teaching staff with various
tasks, such as personalizing their teaching methods, but it also raises
concerns, for example, about the degradation of student-teacher interactions
and user privacy. This paper introduces INSIGHT, a proof of concept to combine
various AI tools to assist teaching staff and students in the process of
solving exercises. INSIGHT has a modular design that allows it to be integrated
into various higher education courses. We analyze students' questions to an LLM
by extracting keywords, which we use to dynamically build an FAQ from students'
questions and provide new insights for the teaching staff to use for more
personalized face-to-face support. Future work could build upon INSIGHT by
using the collected data to provide adaptive learning and adjust content based
on student progress and learning styles to offer a more interactive and
inclusive learning experience.


## AI 摘要

人工智能（AI）尤其是大语言模型（LLM）为教育领域带来机遇与挑战，既能帮助教师实现个性化教学，也可能影响师生互动和隐私安全。本文提出INSIGHT概念验证系统，通过模块化设计整合多种AI工具，辅助师生解答习题。系统分析学生向LLM提出的问题，提取关键词动态构建FAQ，并为教师提供个性化面授的参考依据。未来可基于收集的数据实现自适应学习，根据学生进度和风格调整内容，打造更具互动性和包容性的学习体验。（99字）
