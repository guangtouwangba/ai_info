# INSIGHT: Bridging the Student-Teacher Gap in Times of Large Language Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17677v1

## 原始摘要

The rise of AI, especially Large Language Models, presents challenges and
opportunities to integrate such technology into the classroom. AI has the
potential to revolutionize education by helping teaching staff with various
tasks, such as personalizing their teaching methods, but it also raises
concerns, for example, about the degradation of student-teacher interactions
and user privacy. This paper introduces INSIGHT, a proof of concept to combine
various AI tools to assist teaching staff and students in the process of
solving exercises. INSIGHT has a modular design that allows it to be integrated
into various higher education courses. We analyze students' questions to an LLM
by extracting keywords, which we use to dynamically build an FAQ from students'
questions and provide new insights for the teaching staff to use for more
personalized face-to-face support. Future work could build upon INSIGHT by
using the collected data to provide adaptive learning and adjust content based
on student progress and learning styles to offer a more interactive and
inclusive learning experience.


## AI 摘要

本文介绍了INSIGHT系统，这是一个结合多种AI工具辅助师生完成练习的模块化教育平台。它通过分析学生向大语言模型提出的问题，提取关键词构建动态FAQ，并为教师提供个性化面授的参考依据。该系统可整合到高等教育课程中，在提升教学效率的同时，也引发对师生互动减少和隐私问题的思考。未来可通过收集的学习数据实现自适应教学，根据学生进度和学习风格调整内容，创造更具交互性和包容性的学习体验。研究展现了AI在教育领域革新教学方式与面临挑战的双重性。
