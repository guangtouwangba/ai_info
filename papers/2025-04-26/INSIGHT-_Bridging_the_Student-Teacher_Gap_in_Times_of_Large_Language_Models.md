# INSIGHT: Bridging the Student-Teacher Gap in Times of Large Language Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17677v1

## 原始摘要

The rise of AI, especially Large Language Models, presents challenges and
opportunities to integrate such technology into the classroom. AI has the
potential to revolutionize education by helping teaching staff with various
tasks, such as personalizing their teaching methods, but it also raises
concerns, for example, about the degradation of student-teacher interactions
and user privacy. This paper introduces INSIGHT, a proof of concept to combine
various AI tools to assist teaching staff and students in the process of
solving exercises. INSIGHT has a modular design that allows it to be integrated
into various higher education courses. We analyze students' questions to an LLM
by extracting keywords, which we use to dynamically build an FAQ from students'
questions and provide new insights for the teaching staff to use for more
personalized face-to-face support. Future work could build upon INSIGHT by
using the collected data to provide adaptive learning and adjust content based
on student progress and learning styles to offer a more interactive and
inclusive learning experience.


## AI 摘要

该论文探讨了AI（尤其是大语言模型）在教育领域的应用挑战与机遇，提出INSIGHT概念验证系统。该系统采用模块化设计，整合多种AI工具辅助高校师生解题过程，通过分析学生提问关键词动态构建FAQ，并为教师提供个性化面授支持依据。未来可基于收集的数据实现自适应学习，根据学生进度和风格调整内容，打造更具互动性和包容性的学习体验。研究既肯定了AI在个性化教学中的潜力，也关注到可能削弱师生互动及隐私问题等风险。
