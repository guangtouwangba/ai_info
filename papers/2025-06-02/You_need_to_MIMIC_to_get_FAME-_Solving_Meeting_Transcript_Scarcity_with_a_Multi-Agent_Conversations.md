# You need to MIMIC to get FAME: Solving Meeting Transcript Scarcity with a Multi-Agent Conversations

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13001v2

## 原始摘要

Meeting summarization suffers from limited high-quality data, mainly due to
privacy restrictions and expensive collection processes. We address this gap
with FAME, a dataset of 500 meetings in English and 300 in German produced by
MIMIC, our new multi-agent meeting synthesis framework that generates meeting
transcripts on a given knowledge source by defining psychologically grounded
participant profiles, outlining the conversation, and orchestrating a large
language model (LLM) debate. A modular post-processing step refines these
outputs, mitigating potential repetitiveness and overly formal tones, ensuring
coherent, credible dialogues at scale. We also propose a psychologically
grounded evaluation framework assessing naturalness, social behavior
authenticity, and transcript difficulties. Human assessments show that FAME
approximates real-meeting spontaneity (4.5/5 in naturalness), preserves
speaker-centric challenges (3/5 in spoken language), and introduces richer
information-oriented difficulty (4/5 in difficulty). These findings highlight
that FAME is a good and scalable proxy for real-world meeting conditions. It
enables new test scenarios for meeting summarization research and other
conversation-centric applications in tasks requiring conversation data or
simulating social scenarios under behavioral constraints.


## AI 摘要

FAME是一个包含500场英文和300场德文会议的数据集，由新型多智能体会议合成框架MIMIC生成。MIMIC通过定义心理基础参与者档案、规划对话流程并组织大语言模型(LLM)辩论，基于给定知识源生成会议记录。后处理模块优化输出，减少重复和过度正式语气，确保大规模生成连贯可信的对话。评估显示FAME接近真实会议的自发性(自然度4.5/5)，保留说话者挑战(口语难度3/5)，且信息密度更高(难度4/5)。该数据集为会议摘要研究和社交场景模拟提供了高质量、可扩展的替代方案。
