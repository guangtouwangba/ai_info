# You need to MIMIC to get FAME: Solving Meeting Transcript Scarcity with a Multi-Agent Conversations

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13001v2

## 原始摘要

Meeting summarization suffers from limited high-quality data, mainly due to
privacy restrictions and expensive collection processes. We address this gap
with FAME, a dataset of 500 meetings in English and 300 in German produced by
MIMIC, our new multi-agent meeting synthesis framework that generates meeting
transcripts on a given knowledge source by defining psychologically grounded
participant profiles, outlining the conversation, and orchestrating a large
language model (LLM) debate. A modular post-processing step refines these
outputs, mitigating potential repetitiveness and overly formal tones, ensuring
coherent, credible dialogues at scale. We also propose a psychologically
grounded evaluation framework assessing naturalness, social behavior
authenticity, and transcript difficulties. Human assessments show that FAME
approximates real-meeting spontaneity (4.5/5 in naturalness), preserves
speaker-centric challenges (3/5 in spoken language), and introduces richer
information-oriented difficulty (4/5 in difficulty). These findings highlight
that FAME is a good and scalable proxy for real-world meeting conditions. It
enables new test scenarios for meeting summarization research and other
conversation-centric applications in tasks requiring conversation data or
simulating social scenarios under behavioral constraints.


## AI 摘要

FAME是一个由MIMIC框架生成的会议数据集，包含500份英语和300份德语会议记录。该框架通过多智能体模拟，基于知识源生成会议转录本，结合心理学的参与者角色设定和LLM辩论，并通过后处理减少重复和正式语气。评估显示，FAME在自然性（4.5/5）、口语挑战（3/5）和信息密度（4/5）上接近真实会议，可作为会议摘要研究和其他对话应用的可靠数据源。该数据集解决了高质量会议数据稀缺问题，支持社交场景模拟和对话任务开发。
