## 原始摘要

The widespread adoption of cloud-based proprietary large language models
(LLMs) has introduced significant challenges, including operational
dependencies, privacy concerns, and the necessity of continuous internet
connectivity. In this work, we introduce an LLMOps pipeline, "LlamaDuo", for
the seamless migration of knowledge and abilities from service-oriented LLMs to
smaller, locally manageable models. This pipeline is crucial for ensuring
service continuity in the presence of operational failures, strict privacy
policies, or offline requirements. Our LlamaDuo involves fine-tuning a small
language model against the service LLM using a synthetic dataset generated by
the latter. If the performance of the fine-tuned model falls short of
expectations, it is automatically improved through additional fine-tuning using
extra similar data generated by the service LLM. This multi-turn process
guarantees that the smaller model can eventually match or even surpass the
service LLM's capabilities in specific downstream tasks, offering a practical
and scalable solution for managing AI deployments in constrained environments.
Extensive experiments with leading-edge LLMs are conducted to demonstrate the
effectiveness, adaptability, and affordability of LlamaDuo across various
downstream tasks. Our pipeline implementation is available at

## AI 摘要

本文提出了"LlamaDuo"框架，旨在将云端大语言模型(LLMs)的能力迁移到本地小型模型上。该框架通过使用大模型生成的合成数据对小模型进行微调，若性能不足则自动追加相似数据进行多轮优化，最终使小模型能在特定任务上达到或超越大模型表现。LlamaDuo解决了云模型的依赖性问题、隐私顾虑和联网需求，适用于离线环境或隐私敏感场景。实验证明该方案高效、适应性强且成本低廉。相关代码已开源。
