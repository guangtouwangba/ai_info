## 原始摘要

The widespread adoption of cloud-based proprietary large language models
(LLMs) has introduced significant challenges, including operational
dependencies, privacy concerns, and the necessity of continuous internet
connectivity. In this work, we introduce an LLMOps pipeline, "LlamaDuo", for
the seamless migration of knowledge and abilities from service-oriented LLMs to
smaller, locally manageable models. This pipeline is crucial for ensuring
service continuity in the presence of operational failures, strict privacy
policies, or offline requirements. Our LlamaDuo involves fine-tuning a small
language model against the service LLM using a synthetic dataset generated by
the latter. If the performance of the fine-tuned model falls short of
expectations, it is automatically improved through additional fine-tuning using
extra similar data generated by the service LLM. This multi-turn process
guarantees that the smaller model can eventually match or even surpass the
service LLM's capabilities in specific downstream tasks, offering a practical
and scalable solution for managing AI deployments in constrained environments.
Extensive experiments with leading-edge LLMs are conducted to demonstrate the
effectiveness, adaptability, and affordability of LlamaDuo across various
downstream tasks. Our pipeline implementation is available at

## AI 摘要

本文提出了"LlamaDuo"框架，旨在将云端大型语言模型(LLMs)的能力迁移到本地小型模型上，以解决依赖云服务带来的隐私、网络连接等问题。该框架通过使用大模型生成的合成数据对小模型进行微调，若效果不佳则自动生成更多类似数据进行多轮优化，最终使小模型在特定任务上达到或超越大模型的性能。实验证明LlamaDuo具有高效性、适应性和低成本优势，为受限环境下的AI部署提供了实用解决方案。项目代码已开源。
