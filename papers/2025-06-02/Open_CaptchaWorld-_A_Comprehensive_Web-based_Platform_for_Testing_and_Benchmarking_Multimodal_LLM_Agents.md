# Open CaptchaWorld: A Comprehensive Web-based Platform for Testing and Benchmarking Multimodal LLM Agents

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24878v1

## 原始摘要

CAPTCHAs have been a critical bottleneck for deploying web agents in
real-world applications, often blocking them from completing end-to-end
automation tasks. While modern multimodal LLM agents have demonstrated
impressive performance in static perception tasks, their ability to handle
interactive, multi-step reasoning challenges like CAPTCHAs is largely untested.
To address this gap, we introduce Open CaptchaWorld, the first web-based
benchmark and platform specifically designed to evaluate the visual reasoning
and interaction capabilities of MLLM-powered agents through diverse and dynamic
CAPTCHA puzzles. Our benchmark spans 20 modern CAPTCHA types, totaling 225
CAPTCHAs, annotated with a new metric we propose: CAPTCHA Reasoning Depth,
which quantifies the number of cognitive and motor steps required to solve each
puzzle. Experimental results show that humans consistently achieve near-perfect
scores, state-of-the-art MLLM agents struggle significantly, with success rates
at most 40.0% by Browser-Use Openai-o3, far below human-level performance,
93.3%. This highlights Open CaptchaWorld as a vital benchmark for diagnosing
the limits of current multimodal agents and guiding the development of more
robust multimodal reasoning systems. Code and Data are available at this https

## AI 摘要

研究人员推出首个基于网页的CAPTCHA基准测试平台Open CaptchaWorld，用于评估多模态大语言模型(MLLM)代理的视觉推理和交互能力。该平台包含20种现代CAPTCHA类型共225个谜题，并提出了新的评估指标"CAPTCHA推理深度"来量化解决每个谜题所需的认知和操作步骤。实验显示人类平均成功率高达93.3%，而当前最先进的MLLM代理最高仅达40%，远低于人类水平。该平台为诊断多模态代理的局限性提供了重要基准，将推动开发更强大的多模态推理系统。相关代码和数据已开源。
