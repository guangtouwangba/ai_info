# Open CaptchaWorld: A Comprehensive Web-based Platform for Testing and Benchmarking Multimodal LLM Agents

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24878v1

## 原始摘要

CAPTCHAs have been a critical bottleneck for deploying web agents in
real-world applications, often blocking them from completing end-to-end
automation tasks. While modern multimodal LLM agents have demonstrated
impressive performance in static perception tasks, their ability to handle
interactive, multi-step reasoning challenges like CAPTCHAs is largely untested.
To address this gap, we introduce Open CaptchaWorld, the first web-based
benchmark and platform specifically designed to evaluate the visual reasoning
and interaction capabilities of MLLM-powered agents through diverse and dynamic
CAPTCHA puzzles. Our benchmark spans 20 modern CAPTCHA types, totaling 225
CAPTCHAs, annotated with a new metric we propose: CAPTCHA Reasoning Depth,
which quantifies the number of cognitive and motor steps required to solve each
puzzle. Experimental results show that humans consistently achieve near-perfect
scores, state-of-the-art MLLM agents struggle significantly, with success rates
at most 40.0% by Browser-Use Openai-o3, far below human-level performance,
93.3%. This highlights Open CaptchaWorld as a vital benchmark for diagnosing
the limits of current multimodal agents and guiding the development of more
robust multimodal reasoning systems. Code and Data are available at this https

## AI 摘要

该研究提出了首个基于网页的CAPTCHA基准测试平台Open CaptchaWorld，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLM）代理的视觉推理和交互能力。平台包含20种现代CAPTCHA类型共225个谜题，并引入"CAPTCHA推理深度"新指标量化解题步骤。实验显示人类准确率达93.3%，而最先进的MLLM代理最高仅40%，远低于人类水平。该平台能有效诊断当前多模态代理的局限性，为开发更强大的多模态推理系统提供指导。相关代码和数据已开源。
