# Reading Recognition in the Wild

## 原始摘要

To enable egocentric contextual AI in always-on smart glasses, it is crucial
to be able to keep a record of the user's interactions with the world,
including during reading. In this paper, we introduce a new task of reading
recognition to determine when the user is reading. We first introduce the
first-of-its-kind large-scale multimodal Reading in the Wild dataset,
containing 100 hours of reading and non-reading videos in diverse and realistic
scenarios. We then identify three modalities (egocentric RGB, eye gaze, head
pose) that can be used to solve the task, and present a flexible transformer
model that performs the task using these modalities, either individually or
combined. We show that these modalities are relevant and complementary to the
task, and investigate how to efficiently and effectively encode each modality.
Additionally, we show the usefulness of this dataset towards classifying types
of reading, extending current reading understanding studies conducted in
constrained settings to larger scale, diversity and realism. Code, model, and
data will be public.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种用于智能眼镜的阅读识别任务，以记录用户阅读行为。研究团队发布了首个大规模多模态数据集"Reading in the Wild"，包含100小时真实场景下的阅读/非阅读视频。通过分析RGB图像、视线追踪和头部姿态三种模态，开发了灵活的Transformer模型，证明多模态组合能有效提升识别效果。该研究突破了传统受限环境下的阅读研究限制，支持更大规模和真实场景的应用。数据集和模型将公开，为智能眼镜的上下文感知AI提供重要基础，同时可扩展用于不同类型阅读的分类研究。（99字）
