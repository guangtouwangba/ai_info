# PhySense: Principle-Based Physics Reasoning Benchmarking for Large Language Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24823v1

## 原始摘要

Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced and are increasingly
capable of tackling complex scientific problems, including those in physics.
Despite this progress, current LLMs often fail to emulate the concise,
principle-based reasoning characteristic of human experts, instead generating
lengthy and opaque solutions. This discrepancy highlights a crucial gap in
their ability to apply core physical principles for efficient and interpretable
problem solving. To systematically investigate this limitation, we introduce
PhySense, a novel principle-based physics reasoning benchmark designed to be
easily solvable by experts using guiding principles, yet deceptively difficult
for LLMs without principle-first reasoning. Our evaluation across multiple
state-of-the-art LLMs and prompt types reveals a consistent failure to align
with expert-like reasoning paths, providing insights for developing AI systems
with efficient, robust and interpretable principle-based scientific reasoning.


## AI 摘要

大型语言模型(LLMs)在解决复杂科学问题方面取得进展，但在物理问题上仍难以像人类专家那样进行简洁、基于原理的推理，往往产生冗长不透明的解答。为系统研究这一局限，研究者开发了PhySense基准测试——人类专家能轻松用基本原理解决，但对缺乏"原理优先"推理的LLMs却极具挑战。评估显示，当前最先进的LLMs均无法实现类似专家的推理路径。该研究为开发具有高效、稳健且可解释的科学推理能力AI系统提供了重要洞见。
