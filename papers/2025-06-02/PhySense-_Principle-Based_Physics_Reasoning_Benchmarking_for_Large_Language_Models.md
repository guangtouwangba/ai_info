# PhySense: Principle-Based Physics Reasoning Benchmarking for Large Language Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24823v1

## 原始摘要

Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced and are increasingly
capable of tackling complex scientific problems, including those in physics.
Despite this progress, current LLMs often fail to emulate the concise,
principle-based reasoning characteristic of human experts, instead generating
lengthy and opaque solutions. This discrepancy highlights a crucial gap in
their ability to apply core physical principles for efficient and interpretable
problem solving. To systematically investigate this limitation, we introduce
PhySense, a novel principle-based physics reasoning benchmark designed to be
easily solvable by experts using guiding principles, yet deceptively difficult
for LLMs without principle-first reasoning. Our evaluation across multiple
state-of-the-art LLMs and prompt types reveals a consistent failure to align
with expert-like reasoning paths, providing insights for developing AI systems
with efficient, robust and interpretable principle-based scientific reasoning.


## AI 摘要

当前大语言模型（LLMs）虽能处理复杂科学问题，但仍难以像人类专家那样基于核心原理进行简洁、可解释的推理，常生成冗长且不透明的解答。为此，研究者提出PhySense基准测试，该测试对人类专家（基于物理原理）简单，但对缺乏"原理优先"推理能力的LLMs极具挑战性。实验表明，现有先进LLMs均无法复现专家推理路径，凸显其在高效、鲁棒且可解释的科学推理上的不足。这项研究为开发基于原理的AI科学推理系统提供了关键方向。
