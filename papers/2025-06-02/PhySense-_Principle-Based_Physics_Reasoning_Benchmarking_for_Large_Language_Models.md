# PhySense: Principle-Based Physics Reasoning Benchmarking for Large Language Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24823v1

## 原始摘要

Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced and are increasingly
capable of tackling complex scientific problems, including those in physics.
Despite this progress, current LLMs often fail to emulate the concise,
principle-based reasoning characteristic of human experts, instead generating
lengthy and opaque solutions. This discrepancy highlights a crucial gap in
their ability to apply core physical principles for efficient and interpretable
problem solving. To systematically investigate this limitation, we introduce
PhySense, a novel principle-based physics reasoning benchmark designed to be
easily solvable by experts using guiding principles, yet deceptively difficult
for LLMs without principle-first reasoning. Our evaluation across multiple
state-of-the-art LLMs and prompt types reveals a consistent failure to align
with expert-like reasoning paths, providing insights for developing AI systems
with efficient, robust and interpretable principle-based scientific reasoning.


## AI 摘要

当前大语言模型(LLMs)在解决复杂物理问题时存在明显局限：虽然能力不断提升，但无法像人类专家那样进行简洁、基于原理的推理，常产生冗长不透明的解决方案。为此研究者开发了PhySense基准测试，该测试对人类专家(基于原理推理)很简单，但对LLMs极具挑战性。评估显示，现有最先进的LLMs均难以实现类似专家的推理路径。这一发现揭示了LLMs在运用核心物理原理进行高效、可解释问题解决方面的关键不足，为开发具有稳健、可解释的科学推理能力的AI系统提供了重要洞见。(99字)
