# PhySense: Principle-Based Physics Reasoning Benchmarking for Large Language Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24823v1

## 原始摘要

Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced and are increasingly
capable of tackling complex scientific problems, including those in physics.
Despite this progress, current LLMs often fail to emulate the concise,
principle-based reasoning characteristic of human experts, instead generating
lengthy and opaque solutions. This discrepancy highlights a crucial gap in
their ability to apply core physical principles for efficient and interpretable
problem solving. To systematically investigate this limitation, we introduce
PhySense, a novel principle-based physics reasoning benchmark designed to be
easily solvable by experts using guiding principles, yet deceptively difficult
for LLMs without principle-first reasoning. Our evaluation across multiple
state-of-the-art LLMs and prompt types reveals a consistent failure to align
with expert-like reasoning paths, providing insights for developing AI systems
with efficient, robust and interpretable principle-based scientific reasoning.


## AI 摘要

当前大语言模型(LLMs)虽能处理复杂物理问题，但常无法像人类专家那样进行简洁、基于原理的推理，而是生成冗长不透明的解答。为系统研究这一局限，研究者开发了PhySense基准测试：该测试对人类专家易解(基于核心原理)，但对缺乏原理优先推理的LLMs却极具挑战。评估显示，现有先进LLMs均难以实现类专家推理路径。该研究为开发具有高效、稳健且可解释的科学推理能力的AI系统提供了新见解，突显了LLMs在应用物理原理进行有效推理方面的重要不足。
