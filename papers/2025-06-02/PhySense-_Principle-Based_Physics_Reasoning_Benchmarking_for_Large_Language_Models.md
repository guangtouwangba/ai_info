# PhySense: Principle-Based Physics Reasoning Benchmarking for Large Language Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24823v1

## 原始摘要

Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced and are increasingly
capable of tackling complex scientific problems, including those in physics.
Despite this progress, current LLMs often fail to emulate the concise,
principle-based reasoning characteristic of human experts, instead generating
lengthy and opaque solutions. This discrepancy highlights a crucial gap in
their ability to apply core physical principles for efficient and interpretable
problem solving. To systematically investigate this limitation, we introduce
PhySense, a novel principle-based physics reasoning benchmark designed to be
easily solvable by experts using guiding principles, yet deceptively difficult
for LLMs without principle-first reasoning. Our evaluation across multiple
state-of-the-art LLMs and prompt types reveals a consistent failure to align
with expert-like reasoning paths, providing insights for developing AI systems
with efficient, robust and interpretable principle-based scientific reasoning.


## AI 摘要

当前大语言模型(LLMs)在解决复杂科学问题方面取得进展，但仍难以模拟人类专家基于物理原理的简洁推理方式，常产生冗长不透明的解答。为系统研究这一局限，研究者开发了PhySense基准测试——该测试要求基于核心物理原理进行推理，对人类专家简单但对LLMs极具挑战。多组实验表明，现有LLMs难以遵循专家式推理路径，突显了发展基于原理、高效且可解释的科学推理AI系统的必要性。该研究为提升AI的科学推理能力提供了重要洞见。
