# Welfare and Cost Aggregation for Multi-Agent Control: When to Choose Which Social Cost Function, and Why?

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20772v1

## 原始摘要

Many multi-agent socio-technical systems rely on aggregating heterogeneous
agents' costs into a social cost function (SCF) to coordinate resource
allocation in domains like energy grids, water allocation, or traffic
management. The choice of SCF often entails implicit assumptions and may lead
to undesirable outcomes if not rigorously justified. In this paper, we
demonstrate that what determines which SCF ought to be used is the degree to
which individual costs can be compared across agents and which axioms the
aggregation shall fulfill. Drawing on the results from social choice theory, we
provide guidance on how this process can be used in control applications. We
demonstrate which assumptions about interpersonal utility comparability --
ranging from ordinal level comparability to full cardinal comparability --
together with a choice of desirable axioms, inform the selection of a correct
SCF, be it the classical utilitarian sum, the Nash SCF, or maximin. We then
demonstrate how the proposed framework can be applied for principled
allocations of water and transportation resources.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了在多智能体社会技术系统中，如何通过社会成本函数（SCF）协调资源分配（如能源、水资源或交通）。研究表明，SCF的选择取决于个体成本的可比性程度（从序数到完全基数可比性）以及所需满足的公理。基于社会选择理论，研究提供了SCF选择的指导框架，例如功利主义总和、纳什SCF或最大化最小准则，并分析了不同假设和公理如何影响SCF的合理性。最后，研究通过水资源和交通资源分配的实例，验证了该框架的实际应用价值。
