# VBench-2.0: Advancing Video Generation Benchmark Suite for Intrinsic Faithfulness

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21755v1

## 原始摘要

Video generation has advanced significantly, evolving from producing
unrealistic outputs to generating videos that appear visually convincing and
temporally coherent. To evaluate these video generative models, benchmarks such
as VBench have been developed to assess their faithfulness, measuring factors
like per-frame aesthetics, temporal consistency, and basic prompt adherence.
However, these aspects mainly represent superficial faithfulness, which focus
on whether the video appears visually convincing rather than whether it adheres
to real-world principles. While recent models perform increasingly well on
these metrics, they still struggle to generate videos that are not just
visually plausible but fundamentally realistic. To achieve real "world models"
through video generation, the next frontier lies in intrinsic faithfulness to
ensure that generated videos adhere to physical laws, commonsense reasoning,
anatomical correctness, and compositional integrity. Achieving this level of
realism is essential for applications such as AI-assisted filmmaking and
simulated world modeling. To bridge this gap, we introduce VBench-2.0, a
next-generation benchmark designed to automatically evaluate video generative
models for their intrinsic faithfulness. VBench-2.0 assesses five key
dimensions: Human Fidelity, Controllability, Creativity, Physics, and
Commonsense, each further broken down into fine-grained capabilities. Tailored
for individual dimensions, our evaluation framework integrates generalists such
as state-of-the-art VLMs and LLMs, and specialists, including anomaly detection
methods proposed for video generation. We conduct extensive annotations to
ensure alignment with human judgment. By pushing beyond superficial
faithfulness toward intrinsic faithfulness, VBench-2.0 aims to set a new
standard for the next generation of video generative models in pursuit of
intrinsic faithfulness.


## AI 摘要

视频生成技术已从早期不真实的输出发展到能生成视觉逼真、时序连贯的视频。现有评测基准（如VBench）主要评估表面真实性，如单帧美学、时序一致性和基础提示遵循度，但忽视了更深层的现实世界原则。为推进"世界模型"发展，需要关注内在真实性，即符合物理规律、常识推理、解剖正确性和结构完整性。为此，研究者提出VBench-2.0新基准，从人类逼真度、可控性、创造性、物理性和常识性五个维度，结合通用视觉语言模型和专用异常检测方法，自动评估视频生成模型的内在真实性，为下一代模型设立新标准。
