# VBench-2.0: Advancing Video Generation Benchmark Suite for Intrinsic Faithfulness

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21755v1

## 原始摘要

Video generation has advanced significantly, evolving from producing
unrealistic outputs to generating videos that appear visually convincing and
temporally coherent. To evaluate these video generative models, benchmarks such
as VBench have been developed to assess their faithfulness, measuring factors
like per-frame aesthetics, temporal consistency, and basic prompt adherence.
However, these aspects mainly represent superficial faithfulness, which focus
on whether the video appears visually convincing rather than whether it adheres
to real-world principles. While recent models perform increasingly well on
these metrics, they still struggle to generate videos that are not just
visually plausible but fundamentally realistic. To achieve real "world models"
through video generation, the next frontier lies in intrinsic faithfulness to
ensure that generated videos adhere to physical laws, commonsense reasoning,
anatomical correctness, and compositional integrity. Achieving this level of
realism is essential for applications such as AI-assisted filmmaking and
simulated world modeling. To bridge this gap, we introduce VBench-2.0, a
next-generation benchmark designed to automatically evaluate video generative
models for their intrinsic faithfulness. VBench-2.0 assesses five key
dimensions: Human Fidelity, Controllability, Creativity, Physics, and
Commonsense, each further broken down into fine-grained capabilities. Tailored
for individual dimensions, our evaluation framework integrates generalists such
as state-of-the-art VLMs and LLMs, and specialists, including anomaly detection
methods proposed for video generation. We conduct extensive annotations to
ensure alignment with human judgment. By pushing beyond superficial
faithfulness toward intrinsic faithfulness, VBench-2.0 aims to set a new
standard for the next generation of video generative models in pursuit of
intrinsic faithfulness.


## AI 摘要

视频生成技术已取得显著进展，从早期生成不真实的输出到如今能产生视觉逼真且时序连贯的视频。现有评测基准（如VBench）主要评估表层指标（如帧美学、时序一致性和基础提示匹配），但忽略了生成内容是否符合现实世界规律（如物理法则、常识推理和结构合理性）。为此，研究团队推出VBench-2.0，通过自动化评估五大核心维度（人类拟真度、可控性、创造性、物理合理性和常识性），结合先进视觉语言模型与异常检测方法，建立新一代评测标准，推动视频生成模型从"视觉可信"迈向"本质真实"，为AI影视制作和虚拟世界建模奠定基础。（100字）
