# Understanding the Logic of Direct Preference Alignment through Logic

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17696v2

## 原始摘要

Recent direct preference alignment algorithms (DPA), such as DPO, have shown
great promise in aligning large language models to human preferences. While
this has motivated the development of many new variants of the original DPO
loss, understanding the differences between these recent proposals, as well as
developing new DPA loss functions, remains difficult given the lack of a
technical and conceptual framework for reasoning about the underlying semantics
of these algorithms. In this paper, we attempt to remedy this by formalizing
DPA losses in terms of discrete reasoning problems. Specifically, we ask: Given
an existing DPA loss, can we systematically derive a symbolic program that
characterizes its semantics? We propose a novel formalism for characterizing
preference losses for single model and reference model based approaches, and
identify symbolic forms for a number of commonly used DPA variants. Further, we
show how this formal view of preference learning sheds new light on both the
size and structure of the DPA loss landscape, making it possible to not only
rigorously characterize the relationships between recent loss proposals but
also to systematically explore the landscape and derive new loss functions from
first principles. We hope our framework and findings will help provide useful
guidance to those working on human AI alignment.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种新的形式化框架，用于分析和理解直接偏好对齐（DPA）算法的语义。通过将DPA损失函数建模为离散推理问题，该研究能够系统地推导出表征不同DPA变体语义的符号程序。这一形式化方法不仅揭示了现有DPA损失函数之间的关系，还提供了从基本原理出发探索损失函数空间的新途径。研究为单模型和参考模型方法建立了统一的偏好损失表征体系，有助于更严谨地比较近期提出的各种损失函数，并为开发新的对齐算法提供指导。该框架有望推动人类-AI对齐领域的进一步发展。
