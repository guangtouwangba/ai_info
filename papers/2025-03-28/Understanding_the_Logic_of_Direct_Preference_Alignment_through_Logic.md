# Understanding the Logic of Direct Preference Alignment through Logic

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17696v2

## 原始摘要

Recent direct preference alignment algorithms (DPA), such as DPO, have shown
great promise in aligning large language models to human preferences. While
this has motivated the development of many new variants of the original DPO
loss, understanding the differences between these recent proposals, as well as
developing new DPA loss functions, remains difficult given the lack of a
technical and conceptual framework for reasoning about the underlying semantics
of these algorithms. In this paper, we attempt to remedy this by formalizing
DPA losses in terms of discrete reasoning problems. Specifically, we ask: Given
an existing DPA loss, can we systematically derive a symbolic program that
characterizes its semantics? We propose a novel formalism for characterizing
preference losses for single model and reference model based approaches, and
identify symbolic forms for a number of commonly used DPA variants. Further, we
show how this formal view of preference learning sheds new light on both the
size and structure of the DPA loss landscape, making it possible to not only
rigorously characterize the relationships between recent loss proposals but
also to systematically explore the landscape and derive new loss functions from
first principles. We hope our framework and findings will help provide useful
guidance to those working on human AI alignment.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种新的形式化框架，用于分析和理解直接偏好对齐(DPA)算法的语义。研究者将DPA损失函数转化为离散推理问题，通过符号化程序系统地表征不同DPA变体的语义。该框架不仅能严格分析现有DPA损失(如DPO及其变体)之间的关系，还能从基本原理出发系统地探索损失函数空间并推导新算法。这种形式化视角揭示了DPA损失函数的结构特征和规模，为人类-AI对齐研究提供了理论基础和实用指导，有助于开发更有效的偏好学习算法。
