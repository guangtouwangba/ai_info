**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20751v1

## 原始摘要

Objective: In this review, we aim to provide an analysis of current cardiac
ablation techniques, such as radiofrequency ablation (RF), cryoablation, and
pulsed-field ablation (PFA), with a focus on the role of computational modeling
in enhancing the precision, safety, and effectiveness of these treatments.
Particular attention is given to thermal management, exploring how
computational approaches contribute to understanding and controlling energy
delivery, heat distribution, and tissue response during ablation procedures.
Methods: The mechanisms, applications, and limitations of radiofrequency (RF)
ablation, cryoablation, and pulsed field ablation (PFA) are reviewed.
Additionally, the use of computational approaches, including numerical methods
and artificial intelligence (AI)-based models, for evaluating energy
distribution, lesion size, and tissue response during ablation procedures is
discussed. Results: Computational methods can predict ablation treatment
outcomes and help optimize lesion size, ablation parameters, and procedural
safety. However, these models are only reliable when properly validated and
verified. Conclusion: Further research is essential to collect reliable in vivo
data for validating computational models and integrating them into clinical
practice to improve patient outcomes.


## AI 摘要

本文综述了心脏消融技术（射频、冷冻和脉冲电场消融）及其计算模型的应用。重点探讨了计算建模在优化消融精度、安全性和有效性方面的作用，特别是热管理方面。通过数值方法和AI模型可预测消融结果、优化参数并提高安全性，但这些模型需经过充分验证。未来需进一步收集可靠的体内数据以验证模型，并将其整合到临床实践中，从而改善治疗效果。
