# GenoTEX: A Benchmark for Automated Gene Expression Data Analysis in Alignment with Bioinformaticians

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15341v2

## 原始摘要

Recent advancements in machine learning have significantly improved the
identification of disease-associated genes from gene expression datasets.
However, these processes often require extensive expertise and manual effort,
limiting their scalability. Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown
promise in automating these tasks due to their increasing problem-solving
abilities. To support the evaluation and development of such methods, we
introduce GenoTEX, a benchmark dataset for the automated analysis of gene
expression data. GenoTEX provides annotated code and results for solving a wide
range of gene identification problems, encompassing dataset selection,
preprocessing, and statistical analysis, in a pipeline that follows
computational genomics standards. The benchmark includes expert-curated
annotations from bioinformaticians to ensure accuracy and reliability. To
provide baselines for these tasks, we present GenoAgent, a team of LLM-based
agents that adopt a multi-step programming workflow with flexible
self-correction, to collaboratively analyze gene expression datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate the potential of LLM-based methods in analyzing genomic
data, while error analysis highlights the challenges and areas for future
improvement. We propose GenoTEX as a promising resource for benchmarking and
enhancing automated methods for gene expression data analysis. The benchmark is
available at https://github.com/Liu-Hy/GenoTex.
