**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13865v2

## 原始摘要

Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents have emerged as a transformative
paradigm in human-computer interaction, evolving from rule-based automation
scripts to sophisticated AI-driven systems capable of understanding and
executing complex interface operations. This survey provides a comprehensive
examination of the rapidly advancing field of LLM-based GUI Agents,
systematically analyzing their architectural foundations, technical components,
and evaluation methodologies. We identify and analyze four fundamental
components that constitute modern GUI Agents: (1) perception systems that
integrate text-based parsing with multimodal understanding for comprehensive
interface comprehension; (2) exploration mechanisms that construct and maintain
knowledge bases through internal modeling, historical experience, and external
information retrieval; (3) planning frameworks that leverage advanced reasoning
methodologies for task decomposition and execution; and (4) interaction systems
that manage action generation with robust safety controls. Through rigorous
analysis of these components, we reveal how recent advances in large language
models and multimodal learning have revolutionized GUI automation across
desktop, mobile, and web platforms. We critically examine current evaluation
frameworks, highlighting methodological limitations in existing benchmarks
while proposing directions for standardization. This survey also identifies key
technical challenges, including accurate element localization, effective
knowledge retrieval, long-horizon planning, and safety-aware execution control,
while outlining promising research directions for enhancing GUI Agents'
capabilities. Our systematic review provides researchers and practitioners with
a thorough understanding of the field's current state and offers insights into
future developments in intelligent interface automation.
