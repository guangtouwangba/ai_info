# Control Tax: The Price of Keeping AI in Check

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05296v1

## 原始摘要

The rapid integration of agentic AI into high-stakes real-world applications
requires robust oversight mechanisms. The emerging field of AI Control (AIC)
aims to provide such an oversight mechanism, but practical adoption depends
heavily on implementation overhead. To study this problem better, we introduce
the notion of Control tax -- the operational and financial cost of integrating
control measures into AI pipelines. Our work makes three key contributions to
the field of AIC: (1) we introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the
Control Tax and maps classifier performance to safety assurances; (2) we
conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in
adversarial settings, where attacker models insert subtle backdoors into code
while monitoring models attempt to detect these vulnerabilities; and (3) we
provide empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols and develop
optimized monitoring strategies that balance safety and cost-effectiveness
while accounting for practical constraints like auditing budgets. Our framework
enables practitioners to make informed decisions by systematically connecting
safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AIC through principled economic
feasibility assessment across different deployment contexts.


## AI 摘要

本文提出"控制税"(Control Tax)概念，用于衡量AI系统中集成安全控制措施所需的操作和财务成本。研究建立了量化控制税的理论框架，将分类器性能与安全保证相关联；评估了先进语言模型在对抗性场景(如代码后门检测)中的表现；并提供了控制协议的实际成本估算。通过开发优化的监控策略，研究在安全性和成本效益间取得平衡，同时考虑审计预算等实际约束。该框架通过系统连接安全保证与其成本，帮助从业者做出明智决策，推动AI控制在各种应用场景中的经济可行性评估。
