# Control Tax: The Price of Keeping AI in Check

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05296v1

## 原始摘要

The rapid integration of agentic AI into high-stakes real-world applications
requires robust oversight mechanisms. The emerging field of AI Control (AIC)
aims to provide such an oversight mechanism, but practical adoption depends
heavily on implementation overhead. To study this problem better, we introduce
the notion of Control tax -- the operational and financial cost of integrating
control measures into AI pipelines. Our work makes three key contributions to
the field of AIC: (1) we introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the
Control Tax and maps classifier performance to safety assurances; (2) we
conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in
adversarial settings, where attacker models insert subtle backdoors into code
while monitoring models attempt to detect these vulnerabilities; and (3) we
provide empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols and develop
optimized monitoring strategies that balance safety and cost-effectiveness
while accounting for practical constraints like auditing budgets. Our framework
enables practitioners to make informed decisions by systematically connecting
safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AIC through principled economic
feasibility assessment across different deployment contexts.


## AI 摘要

本文提出"控制税"(Control Tax)概念，用于衡量AI控制措施的实施成本，并建立理论框架量化控制税与安全保障的关系。研究评估了先进语言模型在对抗性环境中的表现，测试攻击模型植入代码后门与监测模型检测漏洞的能力。同时，提供了控制协议的实际成本估算，并开发了平衡安全性与成本效益的优化监测策略，考虑审计预算等现实约束。该框架通过系统关联安全保证与成本，帮助从业者做出明智决策，推动AI控制在经济可行性评估方面的发展。
