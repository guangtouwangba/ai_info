# Time to Talk: LLM Agents for Asynchronous Group Communication in Mafia Games

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05309v1

## 原始摘要

LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user
and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world
settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team
meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the
decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision
making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in
addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate
our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both
human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent
performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its
ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the
agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,
although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and
code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous
communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of
LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions
to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must
be navigated.


## AI 摘要

当前大语言模型(LLMs)主要应用于同步对话场景，而现实交流多为异步模式(如群聊、在线会议等)。本研究开发了一种自适应异步LLM智能体，能自主决定发言时机和内容。通过在"狼人杀"游戏中与人类玩家互动测试，该智能体在游戏表现和社交融入度方面与人类相当，发言时机选择接近人类模式(但内容存在差异)。研究发布了完整数据集和代码，为LLMs融入真实人类群体场景(如团队协作、教育等需处理复杂社交动态的环境)奠定了基础。这项工作推动了LLM在异步交流中的实际应用。
