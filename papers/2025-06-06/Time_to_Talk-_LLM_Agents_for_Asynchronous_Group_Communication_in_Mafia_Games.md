# Time to Talk: LLM Agents for Asynchronous Group Communication in Mafia Games

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05309v1

## 原始摘要

LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user
and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world
settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team
meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the
decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision
making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in
addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate
our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both
human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent
performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its
ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the
agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,
although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and
code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous
communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of
LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions
to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must
be navigated.


## AI 摘要

当前大语言模型(LLMs)主要应用于同步对话场景，而现实中的群聊、在线会议等往往是异步交流。本研究开发了一种能自主决定发言时机的异步LLM智能体，并通过在线"狼人杀"游戏数据集进行测试。结果显示，该智能体在游戏表现和融入度上都达到人类水平，其发言时机选择与人类行为高度相似，但发言内容存在差异。研究公开了所有数据和代码，为LLM在团队协作、教育等复杂社交场景的应用铺平道路，使AI能更自然地参与需要处理动态社交关系的人类群体互动。
