# Time to Talk: LLM Agents for Asynchronous Group Communication in Mafia Games

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05309v1

## 原始摘要

LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user
and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world
settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team
meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the
decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision
making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in
addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate
our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both
human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent
performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its
ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the
agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,
although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and
code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous
communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of
LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions
to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must
be navigated.


## AI 摘要

这项研究开发了一种自适应异步LLM智能体，不仅能决定说什么，还能决定何时发言。研究收集了在线"狼人杀"游戏数据集，包含人类玩家和该智能体的互动。结果表明，智能体在游戏表现和融入人类玩家方面与人类相当，其发言时机选择与人类模式相似，但发言内容存在差异。该工作为LLM融入现实人类群体场景（如团队讨论辅助、教育及专业环境）奠定了基础，并公开了数据和代码以促进更真实的异步通信研究。研究突破了LLM传统同步交互的限制，拓展了在复杂社交动态中的应用潜力。
