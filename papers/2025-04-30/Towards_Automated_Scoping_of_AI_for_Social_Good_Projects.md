# Towards Automated Scoping of AI for Social Good Projects

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20010v1

## 原始摘要

Artificial Intelligence for Social Good (AI4SG) is an emerging effort that
aims to address complex societal challenges with the powerful capabilities of
AI systems. These challenges range from local issues with transit networks to
global wildlife preservation. However, regardless of scale, a critical
bottleneck for many AI4SG initiatives is the laborious process of problem
scoping -- a complex and resource-intensive task -- due to a scarcity of
professionals with both technical and domain expertise. Given the remarkable
applications of large language models (LLM), we propose a Problem Scoping Agent
(PSA) that uses an LLM to generate comprehensive project proposals grounded in
scientific literature and real-world knowledge. We demonstrate that our PSA
framework generates proposals comparable to those written by experts through a
blind review and AI evaluations. Finally, we document the challenges of
real-world problem scoping and note several areas for future work.


## AI 摘要

AI4SG利用AI技术解决社会问题，但项目规划（问题界定）常因缺乏跨领域专家而效率低下。研究提出基于大语言模型（LLM）的"问题界定代理"（PSA），通过整合科学文献和实际知识自动生成项目提案。盲审和AI评估显示，PSA生成的提案质量接近专家水平。研究还指出了现实问题界定中的挑战及未来研究方向。该框架有望提升AI社会应用的规划效率。（100字）
