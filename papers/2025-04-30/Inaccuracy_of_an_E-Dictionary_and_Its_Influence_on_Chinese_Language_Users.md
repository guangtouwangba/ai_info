# Inaccuracy of an E-Dictionary and Its Influence on Chinese Language Users

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00799v2

## 原始摘要

Electronic dictionaries have largely replaced paper dictionaries and become
central tools for L2 learners seeking to expand their vocabulary. Users often
assume these resources are reliable and rarely question the validity of the
definitions provided. The accuracy of major E-dictionaries is seldom
scrutinized, and little attention has been paid to how their corpora are
constructed. Research on dictionary use, particularly the limitations of
electronic dictionaries, remains scarce. This study adopts a combined method of
experimentation, user survey, and dictionary critique to examine Youdao, one of
the most widely used E-dictionaries in China. The experiment involved a
translation task paired with retrospective reflection. Participants were asked
to translate sentences containing words that are insufficiently or inaccurately
defined in Youdao. Their consultation behavior was recorded to analyze how
faulty definitions influenced comprehension. Results show that incomplete or
misleading definitions can cause serious misunderstandings. Additionally,
students exhibited problematic consultation habits. The study further explores
how such flawed definitions originate, highlighting issues in data processing
and the integration of AI and machine learning technologies in dictionary
construction. The findings suggest a need for better training in dictionary
literacy for users, as well as improvements in the underlying AI models used to
build E-dictionaries.


## AI 摘要

电子词典已成为二语学习者扩充词汇的主要工具，但其准确性和语料构建方式鲜受质疑。本研究通过实验、用户调查和词典评析，考察了中国主流电子词典"有道"的缺陷。实验发现，不完整或错误的释义会导致严重误解，且用户存在不当查询习惯。研究进一步揭示了问题根源：数据处理缺陷及AI技术在词典构建中的应用不足。结果表明，用户需加强词典使用素养培训，同时电子词典的AI基础模型也亟待改进。该研究填补了电子词典局限性领域的空白，为提升学习工具可靠性提供了依据。
