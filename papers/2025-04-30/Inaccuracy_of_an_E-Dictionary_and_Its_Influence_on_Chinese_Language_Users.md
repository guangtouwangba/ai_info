# Inaccuracy of an E-Dictionary and Its Influence on Chinese Language Users

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00799v2

## 原始摘要

Electronic dictionaries have largely replaced paper dictionaries and become
central tools for L2 learners seeking to expand their vocabulary. Users often
assume these resources are reliable and rarely question the validity of the
definitions provided. The accuracy of major E-dictionaries is seldom
scrutinized, and little attention has been paid to how their corpora are
constructed. Research on dictionary use, particularly the limitations of
electronic dictionaries, remains scarce. This study adopts a combined method of
experimentation, user survey, and dictionary critique to examine Youdao, one of
the most widely used E-dictionaries in China. The experiment involved a
translation task paired with retrospective reflection. Participants were asked
to translate sentences containing words that are insufficiently or inaccurately
defined in Youdao. Their consultation behavior was recorded to analyze how
faulty definitions influenced comprehension. Results show that incomplete or
misleading definitions can cause serious misunderstandings. Additionally,
students exhibited problematic consultation habits. The study further explores
how such flawed definitions originate, highlighting issues in data processing
and the integration of AI and machine learning technologies in dictionary
construction. The findings suggest a need for better training in dictionary
literacy for users, as well as improvements in the underlying AI models used to
build E-dictionaries.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了中国主流电子词典"有道"的准确性问题。通过实验、用户调查和词典评估相结合的方法，发现词典中存在不完整或错误的定义，导致学习者产生严重误解。研究记录了用户在翻译任务中的查询行为，发现不良的词典使用习惯会加剧理解偏差。分析表明，这些问题源于词典构建过程中的数据处理缺陷以及AI和机器学习技术的应用不足。研究建议应加强用户的词典使用素养培训，并改进电子词典的底层AI模型。该研究填补了电子词典局限性研究的空白，对提高二语学习者的词典使用效果具有启示意义。
