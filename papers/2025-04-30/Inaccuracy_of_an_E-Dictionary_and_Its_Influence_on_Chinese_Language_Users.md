# Inaccuracy of an E-Dictionary and Its Influence on Chinese Language Users

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00799v2

## 原始摘要

Electronic dictionaries have largely replaced paper dictionaries and become
central tools for L2 learners seeking to expand their vocabulary. Users often
assume these resources are reliable and rarely question the validity of the
definitions provided. The accuracy of major E-dictionaries is seldom
scrutinized, and little attention has been paid to how their corpora are
constructed. Research on dictionary use, particularly the limitations of
electronic dictionaries, remains scarce. This study adopts a combined method of
experimentation, user survey, and dictionary critique to examine Youdao, one of
the most widely used E-dictionaries in China. The experiment involved a
translation task paired with retrospective reflection. Participants were asked
to translate sentences containing words that are insufficiently or inaccurately
defined in Youdao. Their consultation behavior was recorded to analyze how
faulty definitions influenced comprehension. Results show that incomplete or
misleading definitions can cause serious misunderstandings. Additionally,
students exhibited problematic consultation habits. The study further explores
how such flawed definitions originate, highlighting issues in data processing
and the integration of AI and machine learning technologies in dictionary
construction. The findings suggest a need for better training in dictionary
literacy for users, as well as improvements in the underlying AI models used to
build E-dictionaries.


## AI 摘要

电子词典已成为二语学习者扩充词汇的主要工具，但用户常默认其可靠性而忽视定义准确性。本研究通过实验、调查和词典评析，考察中国主流电子词典"有道"的缺陷。实验发现，当词典提供不完整或错误定义时，学习者会产生严重误解，并暴露出不良查询习惯。研究进一步揭示这些问题源于数据处理缺陷及AI技术应用不足。结果表明，用户需加强词典使用培训，同时电子词典的AI模型也亟待改进。该研究填补了电子词典局限性研究的空白，对提升词典质量具有启示意义。
