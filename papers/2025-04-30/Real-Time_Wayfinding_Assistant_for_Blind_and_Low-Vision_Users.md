## 原始摘要

Navigating unfamiliar places continues to be one of the most persistent and
essential everyday obstacles for those who are blind or have limited vision
(BLV). Existing assistive technologies, such as GPS-based navigation systems,
AI-powered smart glasses, and sonar-equipped canes, often face limitations in
real-time obstacle avoidance, precise localization, and adaptability to dynamic
surroundings. To investigate potential solutions, we introduced PathFinder, a
novel map-less navigation system that explores different models for
understanding 2D images, including Vision Language Models (VLMs), Large
Language Models (LLMs), and employs monocular depth estimation for free-path
detection. Our approach integrates a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm on
depth images to determine the longest obstacle-free path, ensuring optimal
route selection while maintaining computational efficiency. We conducted
comparative evaluations against existing AI-powered navigation methods and
performed a usability study with BLV participants. The results demonstrate that
PathFinder achieves a favorable balance between accuracy, computational
efficiency, and real-time responsiveness. Notably, it reduces mean absolute
error (MAE) and improves decision-making speed in outdoor navigation compared
to AI-based alternatives. Participant feedback emphasizes the system's
usability and effectiveness in outside situations, but also identifies issues
in complicated indoor locations and low-light conditions. Usability testing
revealed that 73% of participants understood how to use the app in about a
minute, and 80% praised its balance of accuracy, quick response, and overall
convenience.


## AI 摘要

PathFinder是一种新型无地图导航系统，专为视障人士设计。它结合视觉语言模型(VLM)、大语言模型(LLM)和单目深度估计技术，采用深度优先搜索(DFS)算法寻找最长无障碍路径。相比现有AI导航方案，PathFinder在户外导航中降低了平均绝对误差(MAE)，提高了决策速度。用户测试显示，73%的视障参与者能在约1分钟内掌握使用方法，80%认可其准确性、响应速度和便利性。但系统在复杂室内环境和低光照条件下仍有改进空间。该研究为视障导航提供了精度与效率平衡的创新解决方案。
