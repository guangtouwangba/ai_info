# Jekyll-and-Hyde Tipping Point in an AI's Behavior

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20980v1

## 原始摘要

Trust in AI is undermined by the fact that there is no science that predicts
-- or that can explain to the public -- when an LLM's output (e.g. ChatGPT) is
likely to tip mid-response to become wrong, misleading, irrelevant or
dangerous. With deaths and trauma already being blamed on LLMs, this
uncertainty is even pushing people to treat their 'pet' LLM more politely to
'dissuade' it (or its future Artificial General Intelligence offspring) from
suddenly turning on them. Here we address this acute need by deriving from
first principles an exact formula for when a Jekyll-and-Hyde tipping point
occurs at LLMs' most basic level. Requiring only secondary school mathematics,
it shows the cause to be the AI's attention spreading so thin it suddenly
snaps. This exact formula provides quantitative predictions for how the
tipping-point can be delayed or prevented by changing the prompt and the AI's
training. Tailored generalizations will provide policymakers and the public
with a firm platform for discussing any of AI's broader uses and risks, e.g. as
a personal counselor, medical advisor, decision-maker for when to use force in
a conflict situation. It also meets the need for clear and transparent answers
to questions like ''should I be polite to my LLM?''


## AI 摘要

该研究指出，当前缺乏科学理论能预测或解释大型语言模型（LLM）何时会在回答中突然转向错误、误导、无关甚至危险的内容，这削弱了公众对AI的信任。研究者从基本原理推导出一个精确公式，揭示了这种"杰基尔与海德"式突变点的成因——AI注意力过度分散导致突然崩溃。该公式仅需中学数学知识即可理解，并量化预测如何通过调整提示词或训练延迟/防止突变。这为政策制定者和公众提供了讨论AI应用及风险的客观基础，包括医疗咨询、决策支持等场景，同时解答了"是否应对LLM保持礼貌"等实际问题。
