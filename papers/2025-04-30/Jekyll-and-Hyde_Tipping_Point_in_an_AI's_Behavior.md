# Jekyll-and-Hyde Tipping Point in an AI's Behavior

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20980v1

## 原始摘要

Trust in AI is undermined by the fact that there is no science that predicts
-- or that can explain to the public -- when an LLM's output (e.g. ChatGPT) is
likely to tip mid-response to become wrong, misleading, irrelevant or
dangerous. With deaths and trauma already being blamed on LLMs, this
uncertainty is even pushing people to treat their 'pet' LLM more politely to
'dissuade' it (or its future Artificial General Intelligence offspring) from
suddenly turning on them. Here we address this acute need by deriving from
first principles an exact formula for when a Jekyll-and-Hyde tipping point
occurs at LLMs' most basic level. Requiring only secondary school mathematics,
it shows the cause to be the AI's attention spreading so thin it suddenly
snaps. This exact formula provides quantitative predictions for how the
tipping-point can be delayed or prevented by changing the prompt and the AI's
training. Tailored generalizations will provide policymakers and the public
with a firm platform for discussing any of AI's broader uses and risks, e.g. as
a personal counselor, medical advisor, decision-maker for when to use force in
a conflict situation. It also meets the need for clear and transparent answers
to questions like ''should I be polite to my LLM?''


## AI 摘要

该研究从基本原理推导出LLMs（如ChatGPT）输出突然转向错误、误导或不安全行为的临界点公式，揭示了注意力过度分散导致"突变"的机制。仅需中学数学即可理解，该公式能预测如何通过调整提示词和训练来延迟或防止临界点。研究为公众和政策制定者提供了量化讨论AI风险的平台，涉及医疗咨询、冲突决策等场景，并解答了"是否应对LLM保持礼貌"等实际问题。这一科学突破有助于解决当前AI信任危机，其透明解释填补了预测模型突发异常的理论空白。
