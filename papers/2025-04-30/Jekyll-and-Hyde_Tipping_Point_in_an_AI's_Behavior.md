# Jekyll-and-Hyde Tipping Point in an AI's Behavior

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20980v1

## 原始摘要

Trust in AI is undermined by the fact that there is no science that predicts
-- or that can explain to the public -- when an LLM's output (e.g. ChatGPT) is
likely to tip mid-response to become wrong, misleading, irrelevant or
dangerous. With deaths and trauma already being blamed on LLMs, this
uncertainty is even pushing people to treat their 'pet' LLM more politely to
'dissuade' it (or its future Artificial General Intelligence offspring) from
suddenly turning on them. Here we address this acute need by deriving from
first principles an exact formula for when a Jekyll-and-Hyde tipping point
occurs at LLMs' most basic level. Requiring only secondary school mathematics,
it shows the cause to be the AI's attention spreading so thin it suddenly
snaps. This exact formula provides quantitative predictions for how the
tipping-point can be delayed or prevented by changing the prompt and the AI's
training. Tailored generalizations will provide policymakers and the public
with a firm platform for discussing any of AI's broader uses and risks, e.g. as
a personal counselor, medical advisor, decision-maker for when to use force in
a conflict situation. It also meets the need for clear and transparent answers
to questions like ''should I be polite to my LLM?''


## AI 摘要

该研究揭示了大型语言模型(LLM)输出突然转向错误、误导或危险内容的关键临界点(Jekyll-and-Hyde tipping point)，其根本原因是AI注意力过度分散导致突然崩溃。通过基础原理推导出的精确公式(仅需中学数学知识)表明，通过调整提示词和训练方式可延迟或防止这种临界点。该发现为政策制定者和公众讨论AI在医疗咨询、决策支持等领域的应用风险提供了量化依据，同时也解答了"是否应该对AI保持礼貌"等实际问题。研究填补了预测LLM输出可靠性的科学空白，有助于建立公众对AI的信任。
