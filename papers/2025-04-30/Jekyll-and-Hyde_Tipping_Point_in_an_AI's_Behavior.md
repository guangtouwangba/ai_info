# Jekyll-and-Hyde Tipping Point in an AI's Behavior

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20980v1

## 原始摘要

Trust in AI is undermined by the fact that there is no science that predicts
-- or that can explain to the public -- when an LLM's output (e.g. ChatGPT) is
likely to tip mid-response to become wrong, misleading, irrelevant or
dangerous. With deaths and trauma already being blamed on LLMs, this
uncertainty is even pushing people to treat their 'pet' LLM more politely to
'dissuade' it (or its future Artificial General Intelligence offspring) from
suddenly turning on them. Here we address this acute need by deriving from
first principles an exact formula for when a Jekyll-and-Hyde tipping point
occurs at LLMs' most basic level. Requiring only secondary school mathematics,
it shows the cause to be the AI's attention spreading so thin it suddenly
snaps. This exact formula provides quantitative predictions for how the
tipping-point can be delayed or prevented by changing the prompt and the AI's
training. Tailored generalizations will provide policymakers and the public
with a firm platform for discussing any of AI's broader uses and risks, e.g. as
a personal counselor, medical advisor, decision-maker for when to use force in
a conflict situation. It also meets the need for clear and transparent answers
to questions like ''should I be polite to my LLM?''


## AI 摘要

这篇论文探讨了AI信任危机的一个核心问题：目前缺乏科学理论能预测或解释大语言模型（如ChatGPT）何时会在回答中突然转向错误、误导或危险的内容。研究者从基本原理出发，推导出一个精确公式，揭示了这种"杰基尔与海德"式突变点的成因——当AI注意力过度分散时会突然崩溃。该公式仅需中学数学即可理解，能定量预测如何通过调整提示词或训练来延迟或防止这种突变。这为政策制定者和公众讨论AI在医疗、咨询等领域的应用风险提供了科学基础，也解答了"是否该对AI礼貌"等实际问题。
