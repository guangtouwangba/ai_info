**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13865v2

## 原始摘要

Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents have emerged as a transformative
paradigm in human-computer interaction, evolving from rule-based automation
scripts to sophisticated AI-driven systems capable of understanding and
executing complex interface operations. This survey provides a comprehensive
examination of the rapidly advancing field of LLM-based GUI Agents,
systematically analyzing their architectural foundations, technical components,
and evaluation methodologies. We identify and analyze four fundamental
components that constitute modern GUI Agents: (1) perception systems that
integrate text-based parsing with multimodal understanding for comprehensive
interface comprehension; (2) exploration mechanisms that construct and maintain
knowledge bases through internal modeling, historical experience, and external
information retrieval; (3) planning frameworks that leverage advanced reasoning
methodologies for task decomposition and execution; and (4) interaction systems
that manage action generation with robust safety controls. Through rigorous
analysis of these components, we reveal how recent advances in large language
models and multimodal learning have revolutionized GUI automation across
desktop, mobile, and web platforms. We critically examine current evaluation
frameworks, highlighting methodological limitations in existing benchmarks
while proposing directions for standardization. This survey also identifies key
technical challenges, including accurate element localization, effective
knowledge retrieval, long-horizon planning, and safety-aware execution control,
while outlining promising research directions for enhancing GUI Agents'
capabilities. Our systematic review provides researchers and practitioners with
a thorough understanding of the field's current state and offers insights into
future developments in intelligent interface automation.


## AI 摘要

这篇综述系统探讨了基于大语言模型（LLM）的图形用户界面（GUI）智能代理的发展现状。GUI代理已从基于规则的脚本发展为具备多模态理解、知识探索、任务规划和安全交互能力的AI系统，其核心架构包含四个关键组件：界面感知系统（整合文本解析与多模态理解）、知识探索机制（通过内部建模和历史经验构建知识库）、任务规划框架（运用高级推理进行任务分解）以及交互控制系统（确保安全执行）。研究同时指出了元素精确定位、长程任务规划等现存挑战，并展望了标准化评估框架等未来发展方向。
