# MACS: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Optimization of Crystal Structures

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04195v1

## 原始摘要

Geometry optimization of atomic structures is a common and crucial task in
computational chemistry and materials design. Following the learning to
optimize paradigm, we propose a new multi-agent reinforcement learning method
called Multi-Agent Crystal Structure optimization (MACS) to address periodic
crystal structure optimization. MACS treats geometry optimization as a
partially observable Markov game in which atoms are agents that adjust their
positions to collectively discover a stable configuration. We train MACS across
various compositions of reported crystalline materials to obtain a policy that
successfully optimizes structures from the training compositions as well as
structures of larger sizes and unseen compositions, confirming its excellent
scalability and zero-shot transferability. We benchmark our approach against a
broad range of state-of-the-art optimization methods and demonstrate that MACS
optimizes periodic crystal structures significantly faster, with fewer energy
calculations, and the lowest failure rate.


## AI 摘要

研究人员提出了一种名为MACS（多智能体晶体结构优化）的新型强化学习方法，用于周期性晶体结构的几何优化。该方法将原子视为智能体，通过协作调整位置来寻找稳定构型。MACS在不同晶体材料组成上进行训练，不仅能优化训练集中的结构，还能处理更大尺寸和未见过的组成，表现出优秀的可扩展性和零样本迁移能力。相比现有优化方法，MACS显著提高了优化速度，减少了能量计算次数，并具有最低的失败率。这项研究为计算化学和材料设计中的结构优化问题提供了高效解决方案。
