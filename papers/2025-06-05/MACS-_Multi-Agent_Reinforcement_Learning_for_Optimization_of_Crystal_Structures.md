# MACS: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Optimization of Crystal Structures

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04195v1

## 原始摘要

Geometry optimization of atomic structures is a common and crucial task in
computational chemistry and materials design. Following the learning to
optimize paradigm, we propose a new multi-agent reinforcement learning method
called Multi-Agent Crystal Structure optimization (MACS) to address periodic
crystal structure optimization. MACS treats geometry optimization as a
partially observable Markov game in which atoms are agents that adjust their
positions to collectively discover a stable configuration. We train MACS across
various compositions of reported crystalline materials to obtain a policy that
successfully optimizes structures from the training compositions as well as
structures of larger sizes and unseen compositions, confirming its excellent
scalability and zero-shot transferability. We benchmark our approach against a
broad range of state-of-the-art optimization methods and demonstrate that MACS
optimizes periodic crystal structures significantly faster, with fewer energy
calculations, and the lowest failure rate.


## AI 摘要

研究人员提出了一种名为MACS（多智能体晶体结构优化）的新型多智能体强化学习方法，用于周期性晶体结构的几何优化。该方法将原子视为智能体，通过调整位置共同寻找稳定构型，并将其建模为部分可观测的马尔可夫博弈。实验表明，MACS在训练组分上表现优异，并能成功优化更大尺寸和未见组分的结构，展现出良好的可扩展性和零样本迁移能力。与现有优化方法相比，MACS能以更少的能量计算、更快的速度和最低的失败率完成晶体结构优化，为计算化学和材料设计提供了高效解决方案。
