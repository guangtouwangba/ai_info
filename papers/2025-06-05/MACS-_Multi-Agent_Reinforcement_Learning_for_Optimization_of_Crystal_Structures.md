# MACS: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Optimization of Crystal Structures

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04195v1

## 原始摘要

Geometry optimization of atomic structures is a common and crucial task in
computational chemistry and materials design. Following the learning to
optimize paradigm, we propose a new multi-agent reinforcement learning method
called Multi-Agent Crystal Structure optimization (MACS) to address periodic
crystal structure optimization. MACS treats geometry optimization as a
partially observable Markov game in which atoms are agents that adjust their
positions to collectively discover a stable configuration. We train MACS across
various compositions of reported crystalline materials to obtain a policy that
successfully optimizes structures from the training compositions as well as
structures of larger sizes and unseen compositions, confirming its excellent
scalability and zero-shot transferability. We benchmark our approach against a
broad range of state-of-the-art optimization methods and demonstrate that MACS
optimizes periodic crystal structures significantly faster, with fewer energy
calculations, and the lowest failure rate.
