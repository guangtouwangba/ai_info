# MACS: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Optimization of Crystal Structures

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04195v1

## 原始摘要

Geometry optimization of atomic structures is a common and crucial task in
computational chemistry and materials design. Following the learning to
optimize paradigm, we propose a new multi-agent reinforcement learning method
called Multi-Agent Crystal Structure optimization (MACS) to address periodic
crystal structure optimization. MACS treats geometry optimization as a
partially observable Markov game in which atoms are agents that adjust their
positions to collectively discover a stable configuration. We train MACS across
various compositions of reported crystalline materials to obtain a policy that
successfully optimizes structures from the training compositions as well as
structures of larger sizes and unseen compositions, confirming its excellent
scalability and zero-shot transferability. We benchmark our approach against a
broad range of state-of-the-art optimization methods and demonstrate that MACS
optimizes periodic crystal structures significantly faster, with fewer energy
calculations, and the lowest failure rate.


## AI 摘要

研究人员提出了一种名为MACS（多智能体晶体结构优化）的新方法，利用多智能体强化学习来优化周期性晶体结构。该方法将原子视为智能体，通过调整位置共同寻找稳定构型。MACS在多种已知晶体材料上进行训练，获得的策略不仅能优化训练组分的结构，还能处理更大尺寸和未见组分，展现出良好的可扩展性和零样本迁移能力。相比现有优化方法，MACS能以更少的能量计算、更快的速度和最低的失败率完成晶体结构优化。该成果为计算化学和材料设计中的结构优化问题提供了高效解决方案。
