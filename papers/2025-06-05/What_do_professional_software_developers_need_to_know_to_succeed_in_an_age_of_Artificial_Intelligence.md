# What do professional software developers need to know to succeed in an age of Artificial Intelligence?

## 原始摘要

Generative AI is showing early evidence of productivity gains for software
developers, but concerns persist regarding workforce disruption and deskilling.
We describe our research with 21 developers at the cutting edge of using AI,
summarizing 12 of their work goals we uncovered, together with 75 associated
tasks and the skills &amp; knowledge for each, illustrating how developers use AI
at work. From all of these, we distilled our findings in the form of 5
insights. We found that the skills &amp; knowledge to be a successful AI-enhanced
developer are organized into four domains (using Generative AI effectively,
core software engineering, adjacent engineering, and adjacent non-engineering)
deployed at critical junctures throughout a 6-step task workflow. In order to
"future proof" developers for this age of AI, on-the-job learning initiatives
and computer science degree programs will need to target both "soft" skills and
the technical skills &amp; knowledge in all four domains to reskill, upskill and
safeguard against deskilling.


## AI 摘要

研究表明，生成式AI能提升开发者效率，但也引发对职业替代和技能退化的担忧。一项针对21名前沿AI开发者的研究发现，其工作目标可分为12类，涉及75项任务及对应技能，并提炼出5个关键洞察。成功的AI开发者需掌握四大领域技能：高效使用生成式AI、核心软件工程、相关工程及非工程技能，这些技能在6步工作流程中至关重要。为应对AI时代的挑战，职业培训和计算机科学教育需同时加强"软技能"和四大领域的技术能力，以重塑技能、提升竞争力并防止技能退化。
