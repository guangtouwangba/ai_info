# Exploring the Innovation Opportunities for Pre-trained Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15790v1

## 原始摘要

Innovators transform the world by understanding where services are
successfully meeting customers' needs and then using this knowledge to identify
failsafe opportunities for innovation. Pre-trained models have changed the AI
innovation landscape, making it faster and easier to create new AI products and
services. Understanding where pre-trained models are successful is critical for
supporting AI innovation. Unfortunately, the hype cycle surrounding pre-trained
models makes it hard to know where AI can really be successful. To address
this, we investigated pre-trained model applications developed by HCI
researchers as a proxy for commercially successful applications. The research
applications demonstrate technical capabilities, address real user needs, and
avoid ethical challenges. Using an artifact analysis approach, we categorized
capabilities, opportunity domains, data types, and emerging interaction design
patterns, uncovering some of the opportunity space for innovation with
pre-trained models.


## AI 摘要

这篇研究探讨了预训练模型如何促进AI创新。通过分析人机交互研究者开发的预训练模型应用案例，研究发现这些应用展示了技术能力、满足实际需求且规避伦理风险。研究采用人工制品分析法，从功能、应用领域、数据类型和交互设计模式等维度进行归类，揭示了预训练模型的创新机会空间。该研究为识别AI真正可行的应用领域提供了实证依据，有助于突破当前预训练模型炒作周期的认知局限，为创新者提供可靠的创新方向参考。
