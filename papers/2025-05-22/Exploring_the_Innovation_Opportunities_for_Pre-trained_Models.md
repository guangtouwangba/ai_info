# Exploring the Innovation Opportunities for Pre-trained Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15790v1

## 原始摘要

Innovators transform the world by understanding where services are
successfully meeting customers' needs and then using this knowledge to identify
failsafe opportunities for innovation. Pre-trained models have changed the AI
innovation landscape, making it faster and easier to create new AI products and
services. Understanding where pre-trained models are successful is critical for
supporting AI innovation. Unfortunately, the hype cycle surrounding pre-trained
models makes it hard to know where AI can really be successful. To address
this, we investigated pre-trained model applications developed by HCI
researchers as a proxy for commercially successful applications. The research
applications demonstrate technical capabilities, address real user needs, and
avoid ethical challenges. Using an artifact analysis approach, we categorized
capabilities, opportunity domains, data types, and emerging interaction design
patterns, uncovering some of the opportunity space for innovation with
pre-trained models.


## AI 摘要
