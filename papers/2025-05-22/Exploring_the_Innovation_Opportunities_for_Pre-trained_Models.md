# Exploring the Innovation Opportunities for Pre-trained Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15790v1

## 原始摘要

Innovators transform the world by understanding where services are
successfully meeting customers' needs and then using this knowledge to identify
failsafe opportunities for innovation. Pre-trained models have changed the AI
innovation landscape, making it faster and easier to create new AI products and
services. Understanding where pre-trained models are successful is critical for
supporting AI innovation. Unfortunately, the hype cycle surrounding pre-trained
models makes it hard to know where AI can really be successful. To address
this, we investigated pre-trained model applications developed by HCI
researchers as a proxy for commercially successful applications. The research
applications demonstrate technical capabilities, address real user needs, and
avoid ethical challenges. Using an artifact analysis approach, we categorized
capabilities, opportunity domains, data types, and emerging interaction design
patterns, uncovering some of the opportunity space for innovation with
pre-trained models.


## AI 摘要

预训练模型正在改变AI创新格局，但市场炒作使其真实应用场景难以判断。本研究通过分析人机交互（HCI）领域研究者开发的预训练模型应用案例，揭示了其创新机会空间。这些应用既展示了技术可行性，又满足真实用户需求并规避伦理风险。研究采用人工制品分析法，系统梳理了预训练模型的能力维度、应用领域、数据类型及新兴交互设计模式，为识别可靠的AI创新机会提供了实证依据。这些学术原型可视为商业成功应用的先导指标，帮助创新者把握预训练模型的实际价值边界。（99字）
