# Exploring the Innovation Opportunities for Pre-trained Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15790v1

## 原始摘要

Innovators transform the world by understanding where services are
successfully meeting customers' needs and then using this knowledge to identify
failsafe opportunities for innovation. Pre-trained models have changed the AI
innovation landscape, making it faster and easier to create new AI products and
services. Understanding where pre-trained models are successful is critical for
supporting AI innovation. Unfortunately, the hype cycle surrounding pre-trained
models makes it hard to know where AI can really be successful. To address
this, we investigated pre-trained model applications developed by HCI
researchers as a proxy for commercially successful applications. The research
applications demonstrate technical capabilities, address real user needs, and
avoid ethical challenges. Using an artifact analysis approach, we categorized
capabilities, opportunity domains, data types, and emerging interaction design
patterns, uncovering some of the opportunity space for innovation with
pre-trained models.


## AI 摘要

预训练模型改变了AI创新格局，使开发新产品和服务更快捷。然而，过度炒作导致难以判断其实际应用潜力。为此，研究者通过分析人机交互领域的预训练模型应用（因其技术可行性、用户需求匹配和伦理合规性），揭示了创新机会空间。研究采用人工制品分析法，分类了模型能力、应用领域、数据类型及新兴交互模式，为识别可靠的AI创新方向提供了依据。这些应用案例既展示了技术潜力，又规避了伦理风险，可作为商业成功应用的参考。
