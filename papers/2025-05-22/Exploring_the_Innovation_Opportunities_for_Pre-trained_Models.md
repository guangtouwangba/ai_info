# Exploring the Innovation Opportunities for Pre-trained Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15790v1

## 原始摘要

Innovators transform the world by understanding where services are
successfully meeting customers' needs and then using this knowledge to identify
failsafe opportunities for innovation. Pre-trained models have changed the AI
innovation landscape, making it faster and easier to create new AI products and
services. Understanding where pre-trained models are successful is critical for
supporting AI innovation. Unfortunately, the hype cycle surrounding pre-trained
models makes it hard to know where AI can really be successful. To address
this, we investigated pre-trained model applications developed by HCI
researchers as a proxy for commercially successful applications. The research
applications demonstrate technical capabilities, address real user needs, and
avoid ethical challenges. Using an artifact analysis approach, we categorized
capabilities, opportunity domains, data types, and emerging interaction design
patterns, uncovering some of the opportunity space for innovation with
pre-trained models.


## AI 摘要

预训练模型改变了AI创新格局，使开发新产品更快捷。但过度炒作导致难以判断其实际应用潜力。研究者通过分析人机交互领域的预训练模型应用（作为商业成功案例的替代指标），发现这些应用既展示了技术能力，又满足真实需求且规避伦理风险。研究采用人工制品分析法，从功能、应用领域、数据类型和新兴交互模式等维度进行归类，揭示了预训练模型在创新中的机会空间。该成果为识别AI可靠创新方向提供了实证依据，帮助创新者聚焦真正可行的技术落地场景。（99字）
