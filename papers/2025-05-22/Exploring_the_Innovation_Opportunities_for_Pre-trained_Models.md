# Exploring the Innovation Opportunities for Pre-trained Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15790v1

## 原始摘要

Innovators transform the world by understanding where services are
successfully meeting customers' needs and then using this knowledge to identify
failsafe opportunities for innovation. Pre-trained models have changed the AI
innovation landscape, making it faster and easier to create new AI products and
services. Understanding where pre-trained models are successful is critical for
supporting AI innovation. Unfortunately, the hype cycle surrounding pre-trained
models makes it hard to know where AI can really be successful. To address
this, we investigated pre-trained model applications developed by HCI
researchers as a proxy for commercially successful applications. The research
applications demonstrate technical capabilities, address real user needs, and
avoid ethical challenges. Using an artifact analysis approach, we categorized
capabilities, opportunity domains, data types, and emerging interaction design
patterns, uncovering some of the opportunity space for innovation with
pre-trained models.


## AI 摘要

这篇摘要探讨了预训练模型如何改变AI创新格局。研究者通过分析人机交互(HCI)领域开发的预训练模型应用，揭示了这些模型在技术能力、用户需求满足和伦理规避方面的成功案例。研究采用人工制品分析方法，对模型能力、应用领域、数据类型和新兴交互设计模式进行了分类，从而识别出预训练模型带来的创新机会空间。这项工作有助于在AI炒作周期中辨别预训练模型真正适用的领域，为AI产品和服务创新提供可靠参考。研究结果表明，理解预训练模型的实际应用成功案例对支持AI创新至关重要。
