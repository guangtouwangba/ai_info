# Exploring the Innovation Opportunities for Pre-trained Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15790v1

## 原始摘要

Innovators transform the world by understanding where services are
successfully meeting customers' needs and then using this knowledge to identify
failsafe opportunities for innovation. Pre-trained models have changed the AI
innovation landscape, making it faster and easier to create new AI products and
services. Understanding where pre-trained models are successful is critical for
supporting AI innovation. Unfortunately, the hype cycle surrounding pre-trained
models makes it hard to know where AI can really be successful. To address
this, we investigated pre-trained model applications developed by HCI
researchers as a proxy for commercially successful applications. The research
applications demonstrate technical capabilities, address real user needs, and
avoid ethical challenges. Using an artifact analysis approach, we categorized
capabilities, opportunity domains, data types, and emerging interaction design
patterns, uncovering some of the opportunity space for innovation with
pre-trained models.


## AI 摘要

预训练模型正在改变AI创新格局，使其更快、更容易开发新产品和服务。然而，围绕预训练模型的炒作使其实际应用场景难以判断。为此，研究人员分析了人机交互领域的预训练模型应用案例，将其作为商业成功的参照。这些应用展示了技术能力、满足真实用户需求且规避伦理风险。通过人工制品分析法，研究归纳了模型能力、应用领域、数据类型和新兴交互模式，揭示了预训练模型的创新机遇空间。该研究为识别AI创新机会提供了实证依据，有助于区分可行领域与过度炒作方向。（99字）
