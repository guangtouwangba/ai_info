# Exploring the Innovation Opportunities for Pre-trained Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15790v1

## 原始摘要

Innovators transform the world by understanding where services are
successfully meeting customers' needs and then using this knowledge to identify
failsafe opportunities for innovation. Pre-trained models have changed the AI
innovation landscape, making it faster and easier to create new AI products and
services. Understanding where pre-trained models are successful is critical for
supporting AI innovation. Unfortunately, the hype cycle surrounding pre-trained
models makes it hard to know where AI can really be successful. To address
this, we investigated pre-trained model applications developed by HCI
researchers as a proxy for commercially successful applications. The research
applications demonstrate technical capabilities, address real user needs, and
avoid ethical challenges. Using an artifact analysis approach, we categorized
capabilities, opportunity domains, data types, and emerging interaction design
patterns, uncovering some of the opportunity space for innovation with
pre-trained models.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了预训练模型如何推动AI创新。通过分析人机交互研究者开发的预训练模型应用，研究发现这些应用既展示了技术能力，又满足实际用户需求且规避了伦理问题。研究采用人工制品分析法，对模型能力、应用领域、数据类型和新兴交互设计模式进行分类，揭示了预训练模型的创新机会空间。这些研究应用可作为商业成功应用的替代指标，帮助识别AI真正可行的应用场景，克服当前预训练模型炒作周期带来的认知困难，为AI创新提供可靠方向。
