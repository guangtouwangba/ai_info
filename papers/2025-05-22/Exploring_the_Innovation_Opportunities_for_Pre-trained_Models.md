# Exploring the Innovation Opportunities for Pre-trained Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15790v1

## 原始摘要

Innovators transform the world by understanding where services are
successfully meeting customers' needs and then using this knowledge to identify
failsafe opportunities for innovation. Pre-trained models have changed the AI
innovation landscape, making it faster and easier to create new AI products and
services. Understanding where pre-trained models are successful is critical for
supporting AI innovation. Unfortunately, the hype cycle surrounding pre-trained
models makes it hard to know where AI can really be successful. To address
this, we investigated pre-trained model applications developed by HCI
researchers as a proxy for commercially successful applications. The research
applications demonstrate technical capabilities, address real user needs, and
avoid ethical challenges. Using an artifact analysis approach, we categorized
capabilities, opportunity domains, data types, and emerging interaction design
patterns, uncovering some of the opportunity space for innovation with
pre-trained models.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了预训练模型如何推动AI创新。通过分析人机交互研究者开发的预训练模型应用案例（这些应用既展示技术能力又满足实际需求），研究者识别了创新机会领域、数据类型和新兴交互模式。研究发现，理解预训练模型的实际应用场景（而非炒作）对AI创新至关重要，因为这些成功案例既具备技术可行性，又能解决真实用户需求，同时规避伦理风险。该研究为识别预训练模型的可靠创新机会提供了实践框架。
