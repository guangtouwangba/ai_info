# The Agentic Economy

## 原始摘要

Generative AI has transformed human-computer interaction by enabling natural
language interfaces and the emergence of autonomous agents capable of acting on
users' behalf. While early applications have improved individual productivity,
these gains have largely been confined to predefined tasks within existing
workflows. We argue that the more profound economic impact lies in reducing
communication frictions between consumers and businesses. This shift could
reorganize markets, redistribute power, and catalyze the creation of new
products and services. We explore the implications of an agentic economy, where
assistant agents act on behalf of consumers and service agents represent
businesses, interacting programmatically to facilitate transactions. A key
distinction we draw is between unscripted interactions -- enabled by technical
advances in natural language and protocol design -- and unrestricted
interactions, which depend on market structures and governance. We examine the
current limitations of siloed and end-to-end agents, and explore future
scenarios shaped by technical standards and market dynamics. These include the
potential tension between agentic walled gardens and an open web of agents,
implications for advertising and discovery, the evolution of
micro-transactions, and the unbundling and rebundling of digital goods.
Ultimately, we argue that the architecture of agentic communication will
determine the extent to which generative AI democratizes access to economic
opportunity.


## AI 摘要

生成式AI通过自然语言界面和自主代理改变了人机交互，从提升个人生产力转向更深远的经济影响：减少消费者与企业间的沟通摩擦，可能重组市场、重新分配权力并催生新产品服务。核心在于区分"无脚本交互"（依赖自然语言技术进步）和"无限制交互"（依赖市场结构与治理）。研究探讨了当前孤立代理的局限，以及未来可能出现的两种场景：封闭式代理生态与开放代理网络，涉及广告模式、微交易演变和数字商品重组。最终，代理通信架构将决定生成式AI能否真正 democratize 经济机会的获取。
