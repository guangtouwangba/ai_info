# The Agentic Economy

## 原始摘要

Generative AI has transformed human-computer interaction by enabling natural
language interfaces and the emergence of autonomous agents capable of acting on
users' behalf. While early applications have improved individual productivity,
these gains have largely been confined to predefined tasks within existing
workflows. We argue that the more profound economic impact lies in reducing
communication frictions between consumers and businesses. This shift could
reorganize markets, redistribute power, and catalyze the creation of new
products and services. We explore the implications of an agentic economy, where
assistant agents act on behalf of consumers and service agents represent
businesses, interacting programmatically to facilitate transactions. A key
distinction we draw is between unscripted interactions -- enabled by technical
advances in natural language and protocol design -- and unrestricted
interactions, which depend on market structures and governance. We examine the
current limitations of siloed and end-to-end agents, and explore future
scenarios shaped by technical standards and market dynamics. These include the
potential tension between agentic walled gardens and an open web of agents,
implications for advertising and discovery, the evolution of
micro-transactions, and the unbundling and rebundling of digital goods.
Ultimately, we argue that the architecture of agentic communication will
determine the extent to which generative AI democratizes access to economic
opportunity.


## AI 摘要

生成式AI通过自然语言界面和自主代理改变了人机交互，其经济影响不仅限于提升个人生产力，更在于减少消费者与企业间的沟通摩擦，从而重组市场、重新分配权力并催生新产品和服务。未来"代理经济"中，消费者代理与企业代理将通过程序化交互促进交易，其发展取决于技术标准（如自然语言协议）和市场结构（开放或封闭生态）。关键挑战包括：封闭代理生态与开放网络的竞争、广告与发现机制演变、微交易发展，以及数字商品的重组。最终，代理通信架构将决定生成式AI能否真正 democratize 经济机会的获取。
