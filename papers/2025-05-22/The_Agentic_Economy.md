# The Agentic Economy

## 原始摘要

Generative AI has transformed human-computer interaction by enabling natural
language interfaces and the emergence of autonomous agents capable of acting on
users' behalf. While early applications have improved individual productivity,
these gains have largely been confined to predefined tasks within existing
workflows. We argue that the more profound economic impact lies in reducing
communication frictions between consumers and businesses. This shift could
reorganize markets, redistribute power, and catalyze the creation of new
products and services. We explore the implications of an agentic economy, where
assistant agents act on behalf of consumers and service agents represent
businesses, interacting programmatically to facilitate transactions. A key
distinction we draw is between unscripted interactions -- enabled by technical
advances in natural language and protocol design -- and unrestricted
interactions, which depend on market structures and governance. We examine the
current limitations of siloed and end-to-end agents, and explore future
scenarios shaped by technical standards and market dynamics. These include the
potential tension between agentic walled gardens and an open web of agents,
implications for advertising and discovery, the evolution of
micro-transactions, and the unbundling and rebundling of digital goods.
Ultimately, we argue that the architecture of agentic communication will
determine the extent to which generative AI democratizes access to economic
opportunity.


## AI 摘要

生成式AI通过自然语言界面和自主代理改变了人机交互，其经济影响不仅限于提升个人生产力，更在于降低消费者与企业间的沟通壁垒，可能重组市场并催生新产品。核心在于"代理经济"——消费者代理与企业代理的程序化交互。关键区别在于：技术驱动的非预设交互与市场结构决定的无限制交互。当前局限包括孤立代理和端到端代理，未来将受技术标准和市场动态影响，涉及封闭生态与开放代理网络的竞争、广告与发现机制演变、微交易发展及数字商品重组。最终，代理通信架构将决定AI能否真正实现经济机会民主化。（99字）
