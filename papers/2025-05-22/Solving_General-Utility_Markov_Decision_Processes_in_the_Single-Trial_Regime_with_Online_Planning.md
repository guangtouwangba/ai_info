# Solving General-Utility Markov Decision Processes in the Single-Trial Regime with Online Planning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15782v1

## 原始摘要

In this work, we contribute the first approach to solve infinite-horizon
discounted general-utility Markov decision processes (GUMDPs) in the
single-trial regime, i.e., when the agent's performance is evaluated based on a
single trajectory. First, we provide some fundamental results regarding policy
optimization in the single-trial regime, investigating which class of policies
suffices for optimality, casting our problem as a particular MDP that is
equivalent to our original problem, as well as studying the computational
hardness of policy optimization in the single-trial regime. Second, we show how
we can leverage online planning techniques, in particular a Monte-Carlo tree
search algorithm, to solve GUMDPs in the single-trial regime. Third, we provide
experimental results showcasing the superior performance of our approach in
comparison to relevant baselines.
