# The Moral Mind(s) of Large Language Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04476v3

## 原始摘要

As large language models (LLMs) increasingly participate in tasks with
ethical and societal stakes, a critical question arises: do they exhibit an
emergent "moral mind" - a consistent structure of moral preferences guiding
their decisions - and to what extent is this structure shared across models? To
investigate this, we applied tools from revealed preference theory to nearly 40
leading LLMs, presenting each with many structured moral dilemmas spanning five
foundational dimensions of ethical reasoning. Using a probabilistic rationality
test, we found that at least one model from each major provider exhibited
behavior consistent with approximately stable moral preferences, acting as if
guided by an underlying utility function. We then estimated these utility
functions and found that most models cluster around neutral moral stances. To
further characterize heterogeneity, we employed a non-parametric permutation
approach, constructing a probabilistic similarity network based on revealed
preference patterns. The results reveal a shared core in LLMs' moral reasoning,
but also meaningful variation: some models show flexible reasoning across
perspectives, while others adhere to more rigid ethical profiles. These
findings provide a new empirical lens for evaluating moral consistency in LLMs
and offer a framework for benchmarking ethical alignment across AI systems.


## AI 摘要

该研究通过揭示偏好理论分析了近40个主流大语言模型（LLM）在道德困境中的决策行为。研究发现，主要厂商的模型均表现出近似稳定的道德偏好，其决策符合潜在效用函数。多数模型持中立道德立场，但存在显著差异：部分模型能灵活切换伦理视角，而另一些则保持固定模式。研究者构建了基于偏好模式的概率相似网络，发现LLM道德推理存在共同核心，但也呈现多样化特征。该成果为评估AI道德一致性提供了新方法，并建立了跨系统伦理对齐的基准框架。
