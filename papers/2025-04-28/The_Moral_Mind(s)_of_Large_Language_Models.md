# The Moral Mind(s) of Large Language Models

## 原始摘要

As large language models (LLMs) increasingly participate in tasks with
ethical and societal stakes, a critical question arises: do they exhibit an
emergent "moral mind" - a consistent structure of moral preferences guiding
their decisions - and to what extent is this structure shared across models? To
investigate this, we applied tools from revealed preference theory to nearly 40
leading LLMs, presenting each with many structured moral dilemmas spanning five
foundational dimensions of ethical reasoning. Using a probabilistic rationality
test, we found that at least one model from each major provider exhibited
behavior consistent with approximately stable moral preferences, acting as if
guided by an underlying utility function. We then estimated these utility
functions and found that most models cluster around neutral moral stances. To
further characterize heterogeneity, we employed a non-parametric permutation
approach, constructing a probabilistic similarity network based on revealed
preference patterns. The results reveal a shared core in LLMs' moral reasoning,
but also meaningful variation: some models show flexible reasoning across
perspectives, while others adhere to more rigid ethical profiles. These
findings provide a new empirical lens for evaluating moral consistency in LLMs
and offer a framework for benchmarking ethical alignment across AI systems.


## AI 摘要

该研究通过揭示偏好理论分析了近40个主流大语言模型(LLM)在道德困境中的决策行为。研究发现，每个主要供应商至少有一个模型表现出稳定的道德偏好，其决策符合效用函数指导。多数模型持中立道德立场，但也存在显著差异：部分模型能灵活转换道德视角，而另一些则保持更固定的伦理特征。研究构建了基于偏好模式的概率相似网络，揭示了LLM道德推理的共同核心与差异性。这为评估AI系统的道德一致性和伦理对齐提供了新框架和基准方法。
