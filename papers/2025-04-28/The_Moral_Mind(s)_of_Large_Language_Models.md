# The Moral Mind(s) of Large Language Models

## 原始摘要

As large language models (LLMs) increasingly participate in tasks with
ethical and societal stakes, a critical question arises: do they exhibit an
emergent "moral mind" - a consistent structure of moral preferences guiding
their decisions - and to what extent is this structure shared across models? To
investigate this, we applied tools from revealed preference theory to nearly 40
leading LLMs, presenting each with many structured moral dilemmas spanning five
foundational dimensions of ethical reasoning. Using a probabilistic rationality
test, we found that at least one model from each major provider exhibited
behavior consistent with approximately stable moral preferences, acting as if
guided by an underlying utility function. We then estimated these utility
functions and found that most models cluster around neutral moral stances. To
further characterize heterogeneity, we employed a non-parametric permutation
approach, constructing a probabilistic similarity network based on revealed
preference patterns. The results reveal a shared core in LLMs' moral reasoning,
but also meaningful variation: some models show flexible reasoning across
perspectives, while others adhere to more rigid ethical profiles. These
findings provide a new empirical lens for evaluating moral consistency in LLMs
and offer a framework for benchmarking ethical alignment across AI systems.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了大语言模型（LLM）是否具备稳定的"道德思维"，通过揭示偏好理论分析了近40个主流LLM在道德困境中的决策。研究发现，每个主要供应商至少有一个模型表现出近似稳定的道德偏好，其行为符合效用函数指导。多数模型持中立道德立场，但存在显著差异：部分模型能灵活切换伦理视角，而另一些则保持僵化立场。研究揭示了LLMs道德推理的共同核心，同时提供了评估AI系统伦理一致性的新框架。这些发现为AI道德基准测试提供了实证基础。
