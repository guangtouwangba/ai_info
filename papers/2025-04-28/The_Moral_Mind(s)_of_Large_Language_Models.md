# The Moral Mind(s) of Large Language Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04476v3

## 原始摘要

As large language models (LLMs) increasingly participate in tasks with
ethical and societal stakes, a critical question arises: do they exhibit an
emergent "moral mind" - a consistent structure of moral preferences guiding
their decisions - and to what extent is this structure shared across models? To
investigate this, we applied tools from revealed preference theory to nearly 40
leading LLMs, presenting each with many structured moral dilemmas spanning five
foundational dimensions of ethical reasoning. Using a probabilistic rationality
test, we found that at least one model from each major provider exhibited
behavior consistent with approximately stable moral preferences, acting as if
guided by an underlying utility function. We then estimated these utility
functions and found that most models cluster around neutral moral stances. To
further characterize heterogeneity, we employed a non-parametric permutation
approach, constructing a probabilistic similarity network based on revealed
preference patterns. The results reveal a shared core in LLMs' moral reasoning,
but also meaningful variation: some models show flexible reasoning across
perspectives, while others adhere to more rigid ethical profiles. These
findings provide a new empirical lens for evaluating moral consistency in LLMs
and offer a framework for benchmarking ethical alignment across AI systems.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了大型语言模型(LLMs)是否具有一致的道德偏好结构。通过揭示偏好理论工具测试近40个主流LLM，发现每个主要提供商的至少一个模型表现出近似稳定的道德偏好，其决策行为符合效用函数。大多数模型倾向于中性道德立场，但也存在差异：部分模型能灵活推理，而其他则坚持更严格的伦理框架。研究揭示了LLM道德推理的共同核心与显著差异，为评估AI系统的道德一致性提供了新视角和伦理对齐基准框架。
