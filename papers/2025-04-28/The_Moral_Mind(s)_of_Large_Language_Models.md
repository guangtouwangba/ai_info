# The Moral Mind(s) of Large Language Models

## 原始摘要

As large language models (LLMs) increasingly participate in tasks with
ethical and societal stakes, a critical question arises: do they exhibit an
emergent "moral mind" - a consistent structure of moral preferences guiding
their decisions - and to what extent is this structure shared across models? To
investigate this, we applied tools from revealed preference theory to nearly 40
leading LLMs, presenting each with many structured moral dilemmas spanning five
foundational dimensions of ethical reasoning. Using a probabilistic rationality
test, we found that at least one model from each major provider exhibited
behavior consistent with approximately stable moral preferences, acting as if
guided by an underlying utility function. We then estimated these utility
functions and found that most models cluster around neutral moral stances. To
further characterize heterogeneity, we employed a non-parametric permutation
approach, constructing a probabilistic similarity network based on revealed
preference patterns. The results reveal a shared core in LLMs' moral reasoning,
but also meaningful variation: some models show flexible reasoning across
perspectives, while others adhere to more rigid ethical profiles. These
findings provide a new empirical lens for evaluating moral consistency in LLMs
and offer a framework for benchmarking ethical alignment across AI systems.


## AI 摘要

研究表明，大型语言模型（LLMs）在伦理决策中可能表现出稳定的道德偏好结构。通过对近40个主流LLMs进行道德困境测试，发现至少每个主要提供商的模型都表现出近似稳定的道德偏好，其行为符合效用函数引导的特征。多数模型倾向于中立道德立场，但也存在显著差异：部分模型能灵活适应不同伦理视角，而另一些则坚持更固定的道德框架。该研究通过偏好理论和相似性网络分析，为评估LLMs的道德一致性提供了新方法，并为AI系统的伦理对齐建立了基准框架。
