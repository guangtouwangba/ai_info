# Adapting Probabilistic Risk Assessment for AI

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18536v1

## 原始摘要

Modern general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) systems present an urgent
risk management challenge, as their rapidly evolving capabilities and potential
for catastrophic harm outpace our ability to reliably assess their risks.
Current methods often rely on selective testing and undocumented assumptions
about risk priorities, frequently failing to make a serious attempt at
assessing the set of pathways through which Al systems pose direct or indirect
risks to society and the biosphere. This paper introduces the probabilistic
risk assessment (PRA) for AI framework, adapting established PRA techniques
from high-reliability industries (e.g., nuclear power, aerospace) for the new
challenges of advanced AI. The framework guides assessors in identifying
potential risks, estimating likelihood and severity, and explicitly documenting
evidence, underlying assumptions, and analyses at appropriate granularities.
The framework's implementation tool synthesizes the results into a risk report
card with aggregated risk estimates from all assessed risks. This systematic
approach integrates three advances: (1) Aspect-oriented hazard analysis
provides systematic hazard coverage guided by a first-principles taxonomy of AI
system aspects (e.g. capabilities, domain knowledge, affordances); (2) Risk
pathway modeling analyzes causal chains from system aspects to societal impacts
using bidirectional analysis and incorporating prospective techniques; and (3)
Uncertainty management employs scenario decomposition, reference scales, and
explicit tracing protocols to structure credible projections with novelty or
limited data. Additionally, the framework harmonizes diverse assessment methods
by integrating evidence into comparable, quantified absolute risk estimates for
critical decisions. We have implemented this as a workbook tool for AI
developers, evaluators, and regulators, available on the project website.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种针对现代通用人工智能（AI）系统的概率风险评估（PRA）框架，旨在解决当前风险评估方法在应对AI快速演进能力方面的不足。该框架借鉴了核能、航天等高可靠性行业的PRA技术，通过三个方面改进：1）基于AI系统特性（如能力、领域知识）的定向危害分析；2）采用双向分析和前瞻技术建模风险路径；3）运用情景分解和量化标尺管理不确定性。该框架整合多种评估方法，生成可比较的绝对风险估计，并开发了配套工具帮助开发者、评估者和监管者系统识别风险、评估概率和严重性，形成风险报告卡。
