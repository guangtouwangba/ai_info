# Adapting Probabilistic Risk Assessment for AI

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18536v1

## 原始摘要

Modern general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) systems present an urgent
risk management challenge, as their rapidly evolving capabilities and potential
for catastrophic harm outpace our ability to reliably assess their risks.
Current methods often rely on selective testing and undocumented assumptions
about risk priorities, frequently failing to make a serious attempt at
assessing the set of pathways through which Al systems pose direct or indirect
risks to society and the biosphere. This paper introduces the probabilistic
risk assessment (PRA) for AI framework, adapting established PRA techniques
from high-reliability industries (e.g., nuclear power, aerospace) for the new
challenges of advanced AI. The framework guides assessors in identifying
potential risks, estimating likelihood and severity, and explicitly documenting
evidence, underlying assumptions, and analyses at appropriate granularities.
The framework's implementation tool synthesizes the results into a risk report
card with aggregated risk estimates from all assessed risks. This systematic
approach integrates three advances: (1) Aspect-oriented hazard analysis
provides systematic hazard coverage guided by a first-principles taxonomy of AI
system aspects (e.g. capabilities, domain knowledge, affordances); (2) Risk
pathway modeling analyzes causal chains from system aspects to societal impacts
using bidirectional analysis and incorporating prospective techniques; and (3)
Uncertainty management employs scenario decomposition, reference scales, and
explicit tracing protocols to structure credible projections with novelty or
limited data. Additionally, the framework harmonizes diverse assessment methods
by integrating evidence into comparable, quantified absolute risk estimates for
critical decisions. We have implemented this as a workbook tool for AI
developers, evaluators, and regulators, available on the project website.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种针对通用人工智能(AI)系统的概率风险评估(PRA)框架，借鉴了核能、航空航天等高可靠性行业的成熟方法。该框架通过三个关键创新系统性地评估AI风险：(1)基于AI系统特性(如能力、领域知识等)的面向方面危害分析；(2)采用双向分析和前瞻性技术的风险路径建模；(3)运用场景分解、参考尺度和明确追踪协议的不确定性管理。框架整合各类评估方法，生成可比较的量化风险估计，并最终汇总为风险报告卡。研究人员已将该框架开发为工作手册工具，供AI开发者、评估者和监管机构使用。
