# Conversational Assistants to support Heart Failure Patients: comparing a Neurosymbolic Architecture with ChatGPT

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17753v1

## 原始摘要

Conversational assistants are becoming more and more popular, including in
healthcare, partly because of the availability and capabilities of Large
Language Models. There is a need for controlled, probing evaluations with real
stakeholders which can highlight advantages and disadvantages of more
traditional architectures and those based on generative AI. We present a
within-group user study to compare two versions of a conversational assistant
that allows heart failure patients to ask about salt content in food. One
version of the system was developed in-house with a neurosymbolic architecture,
and one is based on ChatGPT. The evaluation shows that the in-house system is
more accurate, completes more tasks and is less verbose than the one based on
ChatGPT; on the other hand, the one based on ChatGPT makes fewer speech errors
and requires fewer clarifications to complete the task. Patients show no
preference for one over the other.


## AI 摘要

本研究比较了两种心力衰竭患者饮食咨询对话助手的表现：一种是基于神经符号架构的自主研发系统，另一种基于ChatGPT。结果显示，自研系统在准确性、任务完成率和简洁性上优于ChatGPT版本，但ChatGPT版本在语音错误率和任务澄清需求方面表现更好。尽管存在这些差异，患者对两种系统没有表现出明显偏好。该研究为医疗领域对话系统的设计提供了实证依据，表明传统架构与生成式AI各有优劣，需要根据具体应用场景权衡选择。
