# The Role of Prescreening in Auctions with Predictions

## 原始摘要

Auctioneers often use closed auctions to create scarcity and prestige, aiming
to intensify competition among a select group of high-status bidders. Advances
in machine learning and AI make this strategy increasingly viable, enabling
cost-effective identification of capable participants. In this paper, we
develop a theoretical model to assess whether such practice can be justified
from an economic perspective. We consider a setting in which bidders have
i.i.d. private valuations, and the auction designer observes a noisy predictor
of each bidder's valuation, which is assumed to be fully informative with some
probability. Based on this noisy predictor, the designer determines how many
bidders to admit -- a process we refer to as prescreening. We show that an
auction with prescreening is equivalent to a standard auction (i.e., without
prescreening) in which bidder valuations are correlated. Notably, the standard
notion of affiliation commonly assumed in the auction literature does not
generally hold in this equivalent formulation. We characterize conditions for
the existence of symmetric and strictly monotone equilibrium strategies across
three classical auction formats: all-pay, first-price, and second-price
auctions. Our results demonstrate that prescreening with noisy predictors can
significantly enhance revenue in all-pay auctions; in fact, with a perfect
predictor, admitting only two bidders is optimal. By contrast, in both
first-price and second-price auctions, admitting all bidders remains
revenue-maximizing.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了拍卖中通过预筛选（prescreening）选择竞标者以提升收益的经济合理性。研究建立理论模型，假设竞标者估值独立同分布，拍卖设计者通过含噪声的估值预测器筛选竞标者数量。结果显示，预筛选拍卖等价于竞标者估值相关的标准拍卖。研究分析了全支付、第一价格和第二价格拍卖中对称严格单调均衡策略的存在条件：全支付拍卖中预筛选能显著提高收益（完美预测时仅需2名竞标者），而第一价格和第二价格拍卖中允许所有竞标者参与仍是收益最优策略。
