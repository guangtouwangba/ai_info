# Modeling Human Behavior in a Strategic Network Game with Complex Group Dynamics

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03795v2

## 原始摘要

Human networks greatly impact important societal outcomes, including wealth
and health inequality, poverty, and bullying. As such, understanding human
networks is critical to learning how to promote favorable societal outcomes. As
a step toward better understanding human networks, we compare and contrast
several methods for learning, from a small data set, models of human behavior
in a strategic network game called the Junior High Game (JHG). These modeling
methods differ with respect to the assumptions they use to parameterize human
behavior (behavior vs. community-aware behavior) and the moments they model
(mean vs. distribution). Results show that the highest-performing method,
called hCAB, models the distribution of human behavior rather than the mean and
assumes humans use community-aware behavior rather than behavior matching. When
applied to small societies (6-11 individuals), the hCAB model closely mirrors
the population dynamics of human groups (with notable differences).
Additionally, in a user study, human participants were unable to distinguish
individual hCAB agents from other humans, thus illustrating that the hCAB model
also produces plausible (individual) human behavior in this strategic network
game.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了人类网络对社会不平等、贫困和霸凌等关键问题的影响，并提出了一种名为hCAB的模型来模拟人类在战略网络游戏中的行为。hCAB通过分析行为分布（而非均值）并结合社区意识行为假设，在小规模群体（6-11人）中准确复现了人类群体的动态特征。实验表明，人类参与者无法区分hCAB模型生成的个体行为与真实人类行为，验证了该模型在模拟个体行为时的可信度。这一成果为理解人类网络行为提供了新工具，有助于优化社会干预策略。
