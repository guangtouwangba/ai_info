# BizChat: Scaffolding AI-Powered Business Planning for Small Business Owners Across Digital Skill Levels

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08493v2

## 原始摘要

Generative AI can help small business owners automate tasks, increase
efficiency, and improve their bottom line. However, despite the seemingly
intuitive design of systems like ChatGPT, significant barriers remain for those
less comfortable with technology. To address these disparities, prior work
highlights accessory skills -- beyond prompt engineering -- users must master
to successfully adopt generative AI including keyboard shortcuts, editing
skills, file conversions, and browser literacy. Building on a design workshop
series and 15 interviews with small businesses, we introduce BizChat, a large
language model (LLM)-powered web application that helps business owners across
digital skills levels write their business plan -- an essential but often
neglected document. To do so, BizChat's interface embodies three design
considerations inspired by learning sciences: ensuring accessibility to users
with less digital skills while maintaining extensibility to power users
("low-floor-high-ceiling"), providing in situ micro-learning to support
entrepreneurial education ("just-in-time learning"), and framing interaction
around business activities ("contextualized technology introduction"). We
conclude with plans for a future BizChat deployment.


## AI 摘要

生成式AI（如ChatGPT）虽能帮助小企业主自动化任务、提升效率，但技术门槛仍是主要障碍。研究发现，用户需掌握键盘快捷键、文件转换等辅助技能才能有效使用AI。为此，研究团队基于设计研讨会和15家小企业访谈，开发了LLM驱动的网页应用BizChat，通过低门槛高扩展性界面（low-floor-high-ceiling）、实时微学习（just-in-time learning）和业务场景化交互（contextualized technology introduction）三大设计原则，帮助不同数字技能水平的用户撰写商业计划书。该工具融合学习科学理念，未来计划进一步部署应用。（99字）
