# BizChat: Scaffolding AI-Powered Business Planning for Small Business Owners Across Digital Skill Levels

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08493v2

## 原始摘要

Generative AI can help small business owners automate tasks, increase
efficiency, and improve their bottom line. However, despite the seemingly
intuitive design of systems like ChatGPT, significant barriers remain for those
less comfortable with technology. To address these disparities, prior work
highlights accessory skills -- beyond prompt engineering -- users must master
to successfully adopt generative AI including keyboard shortcuts, editing
skills, file conversions, and browser literacy. Building on a design workshop
series and 15 interviews with small businesses, we introduce BizChat, a large
language model (LLM)-powered web application that helps business owners across
digital skills levels write their business plan -- an essential but often
neglected document. To do so, BizChat's interface embodies three design
considerations inspired by learning sciences: ensuring accessibility to users
with less digital skills while maintaining extensibility to power users
("low-floor-high-ceiling"), providing in situ micro-learning to support
entrepreneurial education ("just-in-time learning"), and framing interaction
around business activities ("contextualized technology introduction"). We
conclude with plans for a future BizChat deployment.


## AI 摘要

生成式AI能帮助小企业主自动化任务、提高效率并改善盈利，但技术门槛仍是主要障碍。研究发现，除提示工程外，用户还需掌握快捷键、编辑技能等辅助技能才能有效使用AI。为此，研究者基于工作坊和15家小企业访谈，开发了LLM驱动的BizChat网页应用，通过三种设计策略帮助不同数字技能水平的用户撰写商业计划书：(1)低门槛高上限的交互设计；(2)嵌入式微学习支持；(3)围绕业务场景的框架设计。该工具旨在降低AI使用门槛，同时满足高阶用户需求，未来计划进一步部署测试。
