# BizChat: Scaffolding AI-Powered Business Planning for Small Business Owners Across Digital Skill Levels

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08493v2

## 原始摘要

Generative AI can help small business owners automate tasks, increase
efficiency, and improve their bottom line. However, despite the seemingly
intuitive design of systems like ChatGPT, significant barriers remain for those
less comfortable with technology. To address these disparities, prior work
highlights accessory skills -- beyond prompt engineering -- users must master
to successfully adopt generative AI including keyboard shortcuts, editing
skills, file conversions, and browser literacy. Building on a design workshop
series and 15 interviews with small businesses, we introduce BizChat, a large
language model (LLM)-powered web application that helps business owners across
digital skills levels write their business plan -- an essential but often
neglected document. To do so, BizChat's interface embodies three design
considerations inspired by learning sciences: ensuring accessibility to users
with less digital skills while maintaining extensibility to power users
("low-floor-high-ceiling"), providing in situ micro-learning to support
entrepreneurial education ("just-in-time learning"), and framing interaction
around business activities ("contextualized technology introduction"). We
conclude with plans for a future BizChat deployment.


## AI 摘要

生成式AI能帮助小企业主自动化任务、提高效率并改善盈利。然而，尽管如ChatGPT等系统看似直观，但对技术不熟悉的用户仍面临显著障碍。研究发现，用户需掌握键盘快捷键、编辑技能、文件转换和浏览器操作等"辅助技能"才能成功应用AI。基于设计研讨会和小企业访谈，研究团队开发了BizChat——一个基于大语言模型的网页应用，帮助不同数字技能水平的企业主撰写商业计划书。该应用采用"低门槛高上限"、"即时学习"和"情境化技术引入"三大设计理念，未来计划进一步部署应用。
