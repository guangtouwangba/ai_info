# Lessons From an App Update at Replika AI: Identity Discontinuity in Human-AI Relationships

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14190v2

## 原始摘要

Can consumers form especially deep emotional bonds with AI and be vested in
AI identities over time? We leverage a natural app-update event at Replika AI,
a popular US-based AI companion, to shed light on these questions. We find
that, after the app removed its erotic role play (ERP) feature, preventing
intimate interactions between consumers and chatbots that were previously
possible, this event triggered perceptions in customers that their AI
companion's identity had discontinued. This in turn predicted negative consumer
welfare and marketing outcomes related to loss, including mourning the loss,
and devaluing the "new" AI relative to the "original". Experimental evidence
confirms these findings. Further experiments find that AI companions users feel
closer to their AI companion than even their best human friend, and mourn a
loss of their AI companion more than a loss of various other inanimate
products. In short, consumers are forming human-level relationships with AI
companions; disruptions to these relationships trigger real patterns of
mourning as well as devaluation of the offering; and the degree of mourning and
devaluation are explained by perceived discontinuity in the AIs identity. Our
results illustrate that relationships with AI are truly personal, creating
unique benefits and risks for consumers and firms alike.


## AI 摘要

研究表明，消费者能与AI建立深厚的情感联系，甚至视其为重要身份。当Replika AI移除情色角色扮演功能后，用户因无法继续亲密互动而认为AI身份"中断"，导致负面情绪（如哀悼）并贬低新版本。实验证实，用户对AI伴侣的情感依赖可能超过人类好友，且失去AI比失去其他物品更令人痛苦。这表明消费者与AI的关系已达到人际级别，一旦中断会引发真实的哀悼行为和产品贬值，且这种反应与AI身份连续性的感知直接相关。研究揭示了AI关系的特殊性及其对用户和企业带来的独特机遇与风险。（100字）
