## 原始摘要

We are increasingly subjected to the power of AI authorities. As AI decisions
become inescapable, entering domains such as healthcare, education, and law, we
must confront a vital question: how can we ensure AI systems have the
legitimacy necessary for effective governance? This essay argues that to secure
AI legitimacy, we need methods that engage the public in designing and
constraining AI systems, ensuring these technologies reflect the community's
shared values. Constitutional AI, proposed by Anthropic, represents a step
towards this goal, offering a model for democratic control of AI. However,
while Constitutional AI's commitment to hardcoding explicit principles into AI
models enhances transparency and accountability, it falls short in two crucial
aspects: addressing the opacity of individual AI decisions and fostering
genuine democratic legitimacy. To overcome these limitations, this essay
proposes "Public Constitutional AI." This approach envisions a participatory
process where diverse stakeholders, including ordinary citizens, deliberate on
the principles guiding AI development. The resulting "AI Constitution" would
carry the legitimacy of popular authorship, grounding AI governance in the
public will. Furthermore, the essay proposes "AI Courts" to develop "AI case
law," providing concrete examples for operationalizing constitutional
principles in AI training. This evolving combination of constitutional
principles and case law aims to make AI governance more responsive to public
values. By grounding AI governance in deliberative democratic processes, Public
Constitutional AI offers a path to imbue automated authorities with genuine
democratic legitimacy, addressing the unique challenges posed by increasingly
powerful AI systems while ensuring their alignment with the public interest.


## AI 摘要

随着AI决策日益渗透医疗、教育、法律等关键领域，确保AI系统治理的合法性成为核心议题。本文指出，现行"宪法AI"虽通过编码原则提升透明度，但存在决策不透明和民主合法性不足的缺陷。为此提出"公共宪法AI"方案：通过公众参与制定AI宪法原则，并设立"AI法院"发展判例法，使AI治理既体现民主意志又具备实操性。该框架将协商民主机制融入AI治理，在增强系统透明度的同时，通过持续迭代的宪法原则和判例体系，使自动化决策获得真正的民主合法性，确保其符合公共利益。
