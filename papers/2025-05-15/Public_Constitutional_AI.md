## 原始摘要

We are increasingly subjected to the power of AI authorities. As AI decisions
become inescapable, entering domains such as healthcare, education, and law, we
must confront a vital question: how can we ensure AI systems have the
legitimacy necessary for effective governance? This essay argues that to secure
AI legitimacy, we need methods that engage the public in designing and
constraining AI systems, ensuring these technologies reflect the community's
shared values. Constitutional AI, proposed by Anthropic, represents a step
towards this goal, offering a model for democratic control of AI. However,
while Constitutional AI's commitment to hardcoding explicit principles into AI
models enhances transparency and accountability, it falls short in two crucial
aspects: addressing the opacity of individual AI decisions and fostering
genuine democratic legitimacy. To overcome these limitations, this essay
proposes "Public Constitutional AI." This approach envisions a participatory
process where diverse stakeholders, including ordinary citizens, deliberate on
the principles guiding AI development. The resulting "AI Constitution" would
carry the legitimacy of popular authorship, grounding AI governance in the
public will. Furthermore, the essay proposes "AI Courts" to develop "AI case
law," providing concrete examples for operationalizing constitutional
principles in AI training. This evolving combination of constitutional
principles and case law aims to make AI governance more responsive to public
values. By grounding AI governance in deliberative democratic processes, Public
Constitutional AI offers a path to imbue automated authorities with genuine
democratic legitimacy, addressing the unique challenges posed by increasingly
powerful AI systems while ensuring their alignment with the public interest.


## AI 摘要

随着AI在医疗、教育、法律等领域的影响力日益增强，确保AI系统的治理合法性成为关键问题。本文提出"公共宪法AI"方案，主张通过公众参与制定AI开发原则，形成具有民主合法性的"AI宪法"。同时建议设立"AI法院"来发展"AI判例法"，将宪法原则具体化。这一方案旨在通过协商民主程序，使AI治理更符合公共利益。尽管Anthropic公司提出的"宪法AI"通过硬编码原则提升了透明度，但仍存在决策不透明和民主合法性不足的缺陷。公共宪法AI试图通过公众参与和判例体系，为自动化权威注入真正的民主合法性。
