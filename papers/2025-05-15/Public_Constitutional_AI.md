## 原始摘要

We are increasingly subjected to the power of AI authorities. As AI decisions
become inescapable, entering domains such as healthcare, education, and law, we
must confront a vital question: how can we ensure AI systems have the
legitimacy necessary for effective governance? This essay argues that to secure
AI legitimacy, we need methods that engage the public in designing and
constraining AI systems, ensuring these technologies reflect the community's
shared values. Constitutional AI, proposed by Anthropic, represents a step
towards this goal, offering a model for democratic control of AI. However,
while Constitutional AI's commitment to hardcoding explicit principles into AI
models enhances transparency and accountability, it falls short in two crucial
aspects: addressing the opacity of individual AI decisions and fostering
genuine democratic legitimacy. To overcome these limitations, this essay
proposes "Public Constitutional AI." This approach envisions a participatory
process where diverse stakeholders, including ordinary citizens, deliberate on
the principles guiding AI development. The resulting "AI Constitution" would
carry the legitimacy of popular authorship, grounding AI governance in the
public will. Furthermore, the essay proposes "AI Courts" to develop "AI case
law," providing concrete examples for operationalizing constitutional
principles in AI training. This evolving combination of constitutional
principles and case law aims to make AI governance more responsive to public
values. By grounding AI governance in deliberative democratic processes, Public
Constitutional AI offers a path to imbue automated authorities with genuine
democratic legitimacy, addressing the unique challenges posed by increasingly
powerful AI systems while ensuring their alignment with the public interest.


## AI 摘要

随着AI决策在医疗、教育、法律等领域的广泛应用，确保AI系统的治理合法性成为关键问题。本文提出，要获得AI合法性，需让公众参与AI系统的设计与约束，使其体现社会共同价值观。Anthropic提出的"宪法AI"通过硬编码原则增强透明度，但仍存在决策不透明和民主合法性不足的缺陷。为此，作者建议"公共宪法AI"，让多元利益相关者共同制定AI发展原则，形成具有公众认可度的"AI宪法"，并设立"AI法院"通过判例法落实宪法原则。这一基于民主审议的治理模式，旨在使AI决策与公共利益保持一致。
