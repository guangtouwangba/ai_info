# Detecting Multimedia Generated by Large AI Models: A Survey

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00045v5

## 原始摘要

The rapid advancement of Large AI Models (LAIMs), particularly diffusion
models and large language models, has marked a new era where AI-generated
multimedia is increasingly integrated into various aspects of daily life.
Although beneficial in numerous fields, this content presents significant
risks, including potential misuse, societal disruptions, and ethical concerns.
Consequently, detecting multimedia generated by LAIMs has become crucial, with
a marked rise in related research. Despite this, there remains a notable gap in
systematic surveys that focus specifically on detecting LAIM-generated
multimedia. Addressing this, we provide the first survey to comprehensively
cover existing research on detecting multimedia (such as text, images, videos,
audio, and multimodal content) created by LAIMs. Specifically, we introduce a
novel taxonomy for detection methods, categorized by media modality, and
aligned with two perspectives: pure detection (aiming to enhance detection
performance) and beyond detection (adding attributes like generalizability,
robustness, and interpretability to detectors). Additionally, we have presented
a brief overview of generation mechanisms, public datasets, online detection
tools, and evaluation metrics to provide a valuable resource for researchers
and practitioners in this field. Most importantly, we offer a focused analysis
from a social media perspective to highlight their broader societal impact.
Furthermore, we identify current challenges in detection and propose directions
for future research that address unexplored, ongoing, and emerging issues in
detecting multimedia generated by LAIMs. Our aim for this survey is to fill an
academic gap and contribute to global AI security efforts, helping to ensure
the integrity of information in the digital realm. The project link is

## AI 摘要

这篇摘要介绍了一项关于检测大型AI模型(LAIMs)生成多媒体内容的首个系统性综述。随着扩散模型和大语言模型的快速发展，AI生成内容在带来便利的同时也引发滥用、社会扰乱等风险。该研究提出了新的检测方法分类体系，按媒体模态分为纯检测(提升性能)和超越检测(增强通用性、鲁棒性等)两类视角，并概述了生成机制、数据集、在线工具和评估指标。特别从社交媒体角度分析了其社会影响，指出了当前检测面临的挑战和未来研究方向，旨在填补学术空白并为全球AI安全做出贡献。项目链接见文末。
