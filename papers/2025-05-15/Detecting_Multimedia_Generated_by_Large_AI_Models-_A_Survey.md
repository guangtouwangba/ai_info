# Detecting Multimedia Generated by Large AI Models: A Survey

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00045v5

## 原始摘要

The rapid advancement of Large AI Models (LAIMs), particularly diffusion
models and large language models, has marked a new era where AI-generated
multimedia is increasingly integrated into various aspects of daily life.
Although beneficial in numerous fields, this content presents significant
risks, including potential misuse, societal disruptions, and ethical concerns.
Consequently, detecting multimedia generated by LAIMs has become crucial, with
a marked rise in related research. Despite this, there remains a notable gap in
systematic surveys that focus specifically on detecting LAIM-generated
multimedia. Addressing this, we provide the first survey to comprehensively
cover existing research on detecting multimedia (such as text, images, videos,
audio, and multimodal content) created by LAIMs. Specifically, we introduce a
novel taxonomy for detection methods, categorized by media modality, and
aligned with two perspectives: pure detection (aiming to enhance detection
performance) and beyond detection (adding attributes like generalizability,
robustness, and interpretability to detectors). Additionally, we have presented
a brief overview of generation mechanisms, public datasets, online detection
tools, and evaluation metrics to provide a valuable resource for researchers
and practitioners in this field. Most importantly, we offer a focused analysis
from a social media perspective to highlight their broader societal impact.
Furthermore, we identify current challenges in detection and propose directions
for future research that address unexplored, ongoing, and emerging issues in
detecting multimedia generated by LAIMs. Our aim for this survey is to fill an
academic gap and contribute to global AI security efforts, helping to ensure
the integrity of information in the digital realm. The project link is

## AI 摘要

这篇论文首次系统综述了大模型(LAIM)生成多媒体内容的检测方法。随着扩散模型和大语言模型的快速发展，AI生成内容在带来便利的同时也引发滥用、伦理等风险。研究提出新的分类法，按媒体类型(文本、图像、视频等)和检测目标(纯检测与扩展检测)对现有方法进行归类，并总结了生成机制、数据集和评估指标。特别从社交媒体视角分析了社会影响，指出当前检测面临的挑战和未来研究方向。该研究填补了学术空白，旨在为AI安全领域提供参考，维护数字信息真实性。相关资源已在GitHub开源。
