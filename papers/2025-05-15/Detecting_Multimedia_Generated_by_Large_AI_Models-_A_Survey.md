# Detecting Multimedia Generated by Large AI Models: A Survey

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00045v5

## 原始摘要

The rapid advancement of Large AI Models (LAIMs), particularly diffusion
models and large language models, has marked a new era where AI-generated
multimedia is increasingly integrated into various aspects of daily life.
Although beneficial in numerous fields, this content presents significant
risks, including potential misuse, societal disruptions, and ethical concerns.
Consequently, detecting multimedia generated by LAIMs has become crucial, with
a marked rise in related research. Despite this, there remains a notable gap in
systematic surveys that focus specifically on detecting LAIM-generated
multimedia. Addressing this, we provide the first survey to comprehensively
cover existing research on detecting multimedia (such as text, images, videos,
audio, and multimodal content) created by LAIMs. Specifically, we introduce a
novel taxonomy for detection methods, categorized by media modality, and
aligned with two perspectives: pure detection (aiming to enhance detection
performance) and beyond detection (adding attributes like generalizability,
robustness, and interpretability to detectors). Additionally, we have presented
a brief overview of generation mechanisms, public datasets, online detection
tools, and evaluation metrics to provide a valuable resource for researchers
and practitioners in this field. Most importantly, we offer a focused analysis
from a social media perspective to highlight their broader societal impact.
Furthermore, we identify current challenges in detection and propose directions
for future research that address unexplored, ongoing, and emerging issues in
detecting multimedia generated by LAIMs. Our aim for this survey is to fill an
academic gap and contribute to global AI security efforts, helping to ensure
the integrity of information in the digital realm. The project link is

## AI 摘要

大型AI模型（LAIMs）如扩散模型和大语言模型的快速发展，使AI生成的多媒体内容日益融入日常生活。尽管带来诸多便利，但也存在滥用、社会扰乱和伦理风险，因此检测LAIM生成内容变得至关重要。本文首次系统综述了针对文本、图像、视频、音频和多模态内容的检测方法，提出基于媒体类型和检测目标（纯检测与扩展功能）的新分类法，并涵盖生成机制、数据集、工具和评估指标。此外，从社交媒体视角分析其社会影响，指出当前检测挑战和未来研究方向，旨在填补学术空白并助力全球AI安全。
