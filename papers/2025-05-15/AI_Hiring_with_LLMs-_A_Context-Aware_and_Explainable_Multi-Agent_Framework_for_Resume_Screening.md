# AI Hiring with LLMs: A Context-Aware and Explainable Multi-Agent Framework for Resume Screening

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02870v2

## 原始摘要

Resume screening is a critical yet time-intensive process in talent
acquisition, requiring recruiters to analyze vast volume of job applications
while remaining objective, accurate, and fair. With the advancements in Large
Language Models (LLMs), their reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge
bases demonstrate new opportunities to streamline and automate recruitment
workflows. In this work, we propose a multi-agent framework for resume
screening using LLMs to systematically process and evaluate resumes. The
framework consists of four core agents, including a resume extractor, an
evaluator, a summarizer, and a score formatter. To enhance the contextual
relevance of candidate assessments, we integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) within the resume evaluator, allowing incorporation of external knowledge
sources, such as industry-specific expertise, professional certifications,
university rankings, and company-specific hiring criteria. This dynamic
adaptation enables personalized recruitment, bridging the gap between AI
automation and talent acquisition. We assess the effectiveness of our approach
by comparing AI-generated scores with ratings provided by HR professionals on a
dataset of anonymized online resumes. The findings highlight the potential of
multi-agent RAG-LLM systems in automating resume screening, enabling more
efficient and scalable hiring workflows.


## AI 摘要

该研究提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的多智能体框架，用于自动化简历筛选。该框架包含简历提取器、评估器、摘要生成器和分数格式化器四个核心模块，并整合了检索增强生成（RAG）技术，可结合行业专业知识、职业认证等外部信息进行个性化评估。通过将AI评分与HR专家评分对比验证，结果表明这种多智能体RAG-LLM系统能有效提升招聘流程的效率和可扩展性，在保持客观公正的同时显著减少人工筛选时间。研究展示了AI自动化与人才招聘相结合的新机遇。
