# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Simulation for Environmental Policy Synthesis

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12777v2

## 原始摘要

Climate policy development faces significant challenges due to deep
uncertainty, complex system dynamics, and competing stakeholder interests.
Climate simulation methods, such as Earth System Models, have become valuable
tools for policy exploration. However, their typical use is for evaluating
potential polices, rather than directly synthesizing them. The problem can be
inverted to optimize for policy pathways, but the traditional optimization
approaches often struggle with non-linear dynamics, heterogeneous agents, and
comprehensive uncertainty quantification. We propose a framework for augmenting
climate simulations with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to address
these limitations. We identify key challenges at the interface between climate
simulations and the application of MARL in the context of policy synthesis,
including reward definition, scalability with increasing agents and state
spaces, uncertainty propagation across linked systems, and solution validation.
Additionally, we discuss challenges in making MARL-derived solutions
interpretable and useful for policy-makers. Our framework provides a foundation
for more sophisticated climate policy exploration while acknowledging important
limitations and areas for future research.


## AI 摘要

气候政策制定面临深度不确定性、复杂系统动态和利益冲突等挑战。传统气候模拟方法（如地球系统模型）主要用于政策评估而非直接合成。本文提出结合多智能体强化学习（MARL）来优化气候政策路径，以解决非线性动态、异质主体和不确定性量化等问题。关键挑战包括奖励定义、智能体和状态空间的可扩展性、跨系统不确定性传播及方案验证。此外，还需提高MARL解决方案的可解释性和实用性。该框架为更复杂的气候政策探索奠定了基础，但也指出了当前局限性和未来研究方向。（100字）
