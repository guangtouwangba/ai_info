# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Simulation for Environmental Policy Synthesis

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12777v2

## 原始摘要

Climate policy development faces significant challenges due to deep
uncertainty, complex system dynamics, and competing stakeholder interests.
Climate simulation methods, such as Earth System Models, have become valuable
tools for policy exploration. However, their typical use is for evaluating
potential polices, rather than directly synthesizing them. The problem can be
inverted to optimize for policy pathways, but the traditional optimization
approaches often struggle with non-linear dynamics, heterogeneous agents, and
comprehensive uncertainty quantification. We propose a framework for augmenting
climate simulations with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to address
these limitations. We identify key challenges at the interface between climate
simulations and the application of MARL in the context of policy synthesis,
including reward definition, scalability with increasing agents and state
spaces, uncertainty propagation across linked systems, and solution validation.
Additionally, we discuss challenges in making MARL-derived solutions
interpretable and useful for policy-makers. Our framework provides a foundation
for more sophisticated climate policy exploration while acknowledging important
limitations and areas for future research.


## AI 摘要

气候政策制定面临深度不确定性、复杂系统动态和利益冲突等挑战。传统气候模拟方法主要用于政策评估而非直接合成政策，而传统优化方法难以处理非线性动态、多主体交互和不确定性量化。为此，研究者提出结合多智能体强化学习(MARL)的框架来优化气候政策路径，但需解决奖励定义、可扩展性、不确定性传递和方案验证等关键问题。该框架还需提升MARL生成方案的可解释性，以辅助政策制定。研究为气候政策探索提供了新思路，但仍存在局限性，需进一步研究。
