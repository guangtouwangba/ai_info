# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Simulation for Environmental Policy Synthesis

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12777v2

## 原始摘要

Climate policy development faces significant challenges due to deep
uncertainty, complex system dynamics, and competing stakeholder interests.
Climate simulation methods, such as Earth System Models, have become valuable
tools for policy exploration. However, their typical use is for evaluating
potential polices, rather than directly synthesizing them. The problem can be
inverted to optimize for policy pathways, but the traditional optimization
approaches often struggle with non-linear dynamics, heterogeneous agents, and
comprehensive uncertainty quantification. We propose a framework for augmenting
climate simulations with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to address
these limitations. We identify key challenges at the interface between climate
simulations and the application of MARL in the context of policy synthesis,
including reward definition, scalability with increasing agents and state
spaces, uncertainty propagation across linked systems, and solution validation.
Additionally, we discuss challenges in making MARL-derived solutions
interpretable and useful for policy-makers. Our framework provides a foundation
for more sophisticated climate policy exploration while acknowledging important
limitations and areas for future research.


## AI 摘要

气候政策制定面临深层不确定性、复杂系统动态和利益冲突等挑战。传统气候模拟方法（如地球系统模型）主要用于政策评估而非直接合成。虽然可通过优化方法反向求解政策路径，但传统优化难以处理非线性动态、异质主体和不确定性量化。为此，研究者提出用多智能体强化学习（MARL）增强气候模拟的框架，以解决政策合成中的奖励定义、可扩展性、不确定性传递和方案验证等关键问题，同时探讨如何使MARL方案更可解释和实用。该框架为更复杂的气候政策探索奠定基础，但也存在需进一步研究的局限性。
