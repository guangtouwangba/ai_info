# WorldView-Bench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Global Cultural Perspectives in Large Language Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09595v1

## 原始摘要

Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly trained and aligned in ways
that reinforce Western-centric epistemologies and socio-cultural norms, leading
to cultural homogenization and limiting their ability to reflect global
civilizational plurality. Existing benchmarking frameworks fail to adequately
capture this bias, as they rely on rigid, closed-form assessments that overlook
the complexity of cultural inclusivity. To address this, we introduce
WorldView-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Global Cultural Inclusivity
(GCI) in LLMs by analyzing their ability to accommodate diverse worldviews. Our
approach is grounded in the Multiplex Worldview proposed by Senturk et al.,
which distinguishes between Uniplex models, reinforcing cultural
homogenization, and Multiplex models, which integrate diverse perspectives.
WorldView-Bench measures Cultural Polarization, the exclusion of alternative
perspectives, through free-form generative evaluation rather than conventional
categorical benchmarks. We implement applied multiplexity through two
intervention strategies: (1) Contextually-Implemented Multiplex LLMs, where
system prompts embed multiplexity principles, and (2) Multi-Agent System
(MAS)-Implemented Multiplex LLMs, where multiple LLM agents representing
distinct cultural perspectives collaboratively generate responses. Our results
demonstrate a significant increase in Perspectives Distribution Score (PDS)
entropy from 13% at baseline to 94% with MAS-Implemented Multiplex LLMs,
alongside a shift toward positive sentiment (67.7%) and enhanced cultural
balance. These findings highlight the potential of multiplex-aware AI
evaluation in mitigating cultural bias in LLMs, paving the way for more
inclusive and ethically aligned AI systems.


## AI 摘要

当前大语言模型（LLMs）的训练和对齐方式主要强化西方中心认知，导致文化同质化，难以反映全球文明多样性。现有评估框架依赖封闭式测试，无法有效捕捉这种偏见。为此，研究者提出WorldView-Bench基准，基于"多元世界观"理论，通过自由生成式评估衡量文化包容性（GCI）。采用两种干预策略：（1）上下文嵌入多元原则；（2）多智能体系统（MAS）协同生成不同文化视角的回应。实验显示，MAS方法将视角分布熵值从13%提升至94%，积极情感达67.7%，显著改善文化平衡。这表明多元感知评估能有效减少LLMs的文化偏见。
