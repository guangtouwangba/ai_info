# Ethics and Persuasion in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback: A Procedural Rhetorical Approach

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09576v1

## 原始摘要

Since 2022, versions of generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and Claude
have been trained using a specialized technique called Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF) to fine-tune language model output using feedback
from human annotators. As a result, the integration of RLHF has greatly
enhanced the outputs of these large language models (LLMs) and made the
interactions and responses appear more "human-like" than those of previous
versions using only supervised learning. The increasing convergence of human
and machine-written text has potentially severe ethical, sociotechnical, and
pedagogical implications relating to transparency, trust, bias, and
interpersonal relations. To highlight these implications, this paper presents a
rhetorical analysis of some of the central procedures and processes currently
being reshaped by RLHF-enhanced generative AI chatbots: upholding language
conventions, information seeking practices, and expectations for social
relationships. Rhetorical investigations of generative AI and LLMs have, to
this point, focused largely on the persuasiveness of the content generated.
Using Ian Bogost's concept of procedural rhetoric, this paper shifts the site
of rhetorical investigation from content analysis to the underlying mechanisms
of persuasion built into RLHF-enhanced LLMs. In doing so, this theoretical
investigation opens a new direction for further inquiry in AI ethics that
considers how procedures rerouted through AI-driven technologies might
reinforce hegemonic language use, perpetuate biases, decontextualize learning,
and encroach upon human relationships. It will therefore be of interest to
educators, researchers, scholars, and the growing number of users of generative
AI chatbots.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文探讨了基于人类反馈强化学习(RLHF)训练的生成式AI(如ChatGPT)带来的伦理和社会影响。RLHF技术使AI输出更"拟人化"，但也引发了透明度、偏见、人际关系等方面的隐忧。研究采用程序修辞学视角，分析了AI如何重塑语言规范、信息获取和社交期待等核心流程，指出其可能强化语言霸权、固化偏见、脱离学习情境并侵蚀人际关系。这一理论框架为AI伦理研究开辟了新方向，对教育工作者、研究人员和日益增长的AI用户具有重要启示意义。
