# Ethics and Persuasion in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback: A Procedural Rhetorical Approach

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09576v1

## 原始摘要

Since 2022, versions of generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and Claude
have been trained using a specialized technique called Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF) to fine-tune language model output using feedback
from human annotators. As a result, the integration of RLHF has greatly
enhanced the outputs of these large language models (LLMs) and made the
interactions and responses appear more "human-like" than those of previous
versions using only supervised learning. The increasing convergence of human
and machine-written text has potentially severe ethical, sociotechnical, and
pedagogical implications relating to transparency, trust, bias, and
interpersonal relations. To highlight these implications, this paper presents a
rhetorical analysis of some of the central procedures and processes currently
being reshaped by RLHF-enhanced generative AI chatbots: upholding language
conventions, information seeking practices, and expectations for social
relationships. Rhetorical investigations of generative AI and LLMs have, to
this point, focused largely on the persuasiveness of the content generated.
Using Ian Bogost's concept of procedural rhetoric, this paper shifts the site
of rhetorical investigation from content analysis to the underlying mechanisms
of persuasion built into RLHF-enhanced LLMs. In doing so, this theoretical
investigation opens a new direction for further inquiry in AI ethics that
considers how procedures rerouted through AI-driven technologies might
reinforce hegemonic language use, perpetuate biases, decontextualize learning,
and encroach upon human relationships. It will therefore be of interest to
educators, researchers, scholars, and the growing number of users of generative
AI chatbots.


## AI 摘要

2022年以来，ChatGPT等生成式AI通过"人类反馈强化学习"(RLHF)技术进行优化，使输出更趋近人类表达。这种技术进步虽提升了交互体验，却引发了关于透明度、偏见和社会关系的伦理隐忧。本文采用程序修辞学视角，突破传统对AI生成内容说服力的分析，转而考察RLHF机制本身如何重塑语言规范、信息获取和社交期待。研究指出，AI技术程序可能强化语言霸权、固化偏见、使学习去情境化并影响人际关系，为AI伦理研究开辟了新方向。该分析对教育工作者、学者及AI使用者具有重要启示意义。（99字）
