# Ethics and Persuasion in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback: A Procedural Rhetorical Approach

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09576v1

## 原始摘要

Since 2022, versions of generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and Claude
have been trained using a specialized technique called Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF) to fine-tune language model output using feedback
from human annotators. As a result, the integration of RLHF has greatly
enhanced the outputs of these large language models (LLMs) and made the
interactions and responses appear more "human-like" than those of previous
versions using only supervised learning. The increasing convergence of human
and machine-written text has potentially severe ethical, sociotechnical, and
pedagogical implications relating to transparency, trust, bias, and
interpersonal relations. To highlight these implications, this paper presents a
rhetorical analysis of some of the central procedures and processes currently
being reshaped by RLHF-enhanced generative AI chatbots: upholding language
conventions, information seeking practices, and expectations for social
relationships. Rhetorical investigations of generative AI and LLMs have, to
this point, focused largely on the persuasiveness of the content generated.
Using Ian Bogost's concept of procedural rhetoric, this paper shifts the site
of rhetorical investigation from content analysis to the underlying mechanisms
of persuasion built into RLHF-enhanced LLMs. In doing so, this theoretical
investigation opens a new direction for further inquiry in AI ethics that
considers how procedures rerouted through AI-driven technologies might
reinforce hegemonic language use, perpetuate biases, decontextualize learning,
and encroach upon human relationships. It will therefore be of interest to
educators, researchers, scholars, and the growing number of users of generative
AI chatbots.


## AI 摘要

自2022年起，ChatGPT等生成式AI通过"人类反馈强化学习"(RLHF)技术优化输出，使语言模型表现更接近人类。这种进步虽提升了交互体验，却引发了伦理和社会问题：透明度缺失、偏见固化、人际关系异化等。本文采用程序修辞学视角，突破传统对AI生成内容的分析，转而考察RLHF机制内嵌的说服逻辑，揭示其可能强化语言霸权、传播偏见、使学习去情境化并侵蚀人际关系的风险。该研究为AI伦理开辟了新方向，对教育工作者、学者及AI使用者具有重要启示意义。（99字）
