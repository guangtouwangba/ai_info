# Deontic Temporal Logic for Formal Verification of AI Ethics

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05765v2

## 原始摘要

Ensuring ethical behavior in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems amidst
their increasing ubiquity and influence is a major concern the world over. The
use of formal methods in AI ethics is a possible crucial approach for
specifying and verifying the ethical behavior of AI systems. This paper
proposes a formalization based on deontic logic to define and evaluate the
ethical behavior of AI systems, focusing on system-level specifications,
contributing to this important goal. It introduces axioms and theorems to
capture ethical requirements related to fairness and explainability. The
formalization incorporates temporal operators to reason about the ethical
behavior of AI systems over time. The authors evaluate the effectiveness of
this formalization by assessing the ethics of the real-world COMPAS and loan
prediction AI systems. Various ethical properties of the COMPAS and loan
prediction systems are encoded using deontic logical formulas, allowing the use
of an automated theorem prover to verify whether these systems satisfy the
defined properties. The formal verification reveals that both systems fail to
fulfill certain key ethical properties related to fairness and
non-discrimination, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed
formalization in identifying potential ethical issues in real-world AI
applications.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种基于道义逻辑的形式化方法，用于定义和评估AI系统的伦理行为，重点关注公平性和可解释性等伦理要求。该方法引入公理和定理，并整合时间算子来分析AI系统随时间变化的伦理表现。作者通过评估COMPAS和贷款预测两个实际AI系统验证了该方法的有效性，使用自动定理证明器检查这些系统是否满足定义的伦理属性。形式化验证显示，这两个系统未能满足某些关键的公平性和非歧视性伦理要求，表明该方法能有效识别现实AI应用中的潜在伦理问题。
