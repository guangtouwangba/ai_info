# ICLR Points: How Many ICLR Publications Is One Paper in Each Area?

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16623v4

## 原始摘要

Scientific publications significantly impact academic-related decisions in
computer science, where top-tier conferences are particularly influential.
However, efforts required to produce a publication differ drastically across
various subfields. While existing citation-based studies compare venues within
areas, cross-area comparisons remain challenging due to differing publication
volumes and citation practices.
  To address this gap, we introduce the concept of ICLR points, defined as the
average effort required to produce one publication at top-tier machine learning
conferences such as ICLR, ICML, and NeurIPS. Leveraging comprehensive
publication data from DBLP (2019--2023) and faculty information from
CSRankings, we quantitatively measure and compare the average publication
effort across 27 computer science sub-areas. Our analysis reveals significant
differences in average publication effort, validating anecdotal perceptions:
systems conferences generally require more effort per publication than AI
conferences.
  We further demonstrate the utility of the ICLR points metric by evaluating
publication records of universities, current faculties and recent faculty
candidates. Our findings highlight how using this metric enables more
meaningful cross-area comparisons in academic evaluation processes. Lastly, we
discuss the metric's limitations and caution against its misuse, emphasizing
the necessity of holistic assessment criteria beyond publication metrics alone.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文提出了"ICLR点数"的概念，用于量化计算机科学不同子领域发表论文的平均工作量。通过分析DBLP(2019-2023)的出版物数据和CSRankings的教师信息，研究发现系统领域会议比AI领域会议需要更多工作量。该指标有助于跨领域学术评估，但作者强调需结合全面评估标准，避免单一指标滥用。研究比较了27个计算机科学子领域的发表工作量差异，验证了领域间的显著差异，并展示了该指标在评估大学、教师和候选人发表记录中的应用价值。
