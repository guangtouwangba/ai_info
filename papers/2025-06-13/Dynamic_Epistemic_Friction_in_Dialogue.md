# Dynamic Epistemic Friction in Dialogue

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10934v1

## 原始摘要

Recent developments in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
preferences have significantly enhanced their utility in human-AI collaborative
scenarios. However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of
"epistemic friction," or the inherent resistance encountered when updating
beliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this
paper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic
integration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current
belief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position
this within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit,
2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the
interaction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that
demonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief
updates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief
alignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be
made more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue
scenarios.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了大语言模型（LLM）与人类偏好对齐中的"认知摩擦"问题，即个体在面对新信息时更新信念的内在阻力。研究将动态认知摩擦定义为对外部证据支持的命题与现有信念不匹配时的认知整合阻力，并基于动态认知逻辑框架进行分析。通过协作任务实验表明，该模型能有效预测对话中的信念更新。研究还讨论了如何将信念对齐作为认知阻力或摩擦的衡量标准，以更好地适应现实对话场景的复杂性。这一发现为改进人机协作中的信念对齐机制提供了新视角。
