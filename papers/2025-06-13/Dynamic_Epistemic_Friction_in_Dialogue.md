# Dynamic Epistemic Friction in Dialogue

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10934v1

## 原始摘要

Recent developments in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
preferences have significantly enhanced their utility in human-AI collaborative
scenarios. However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of
"epistemic friction," or the inherent resistance encountered when updating
beliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this
paper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic
integration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current
belief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position
this within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit,
2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the
interaction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that
demonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief
updates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief
alignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be
made more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue
scenarios.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了大型语言模型(LLMs)与人类偏好对齐中的"认知摩擦"问题，即智能体在面对新信息时更新信念的内在阻力。作者将动态认知摩擦定义为当前信念状态与外部证据支持的新命题之间的错位，并将其置于动态认知逻辑框架下分析。研究表明，这种认知摩擦模型能有效预测对话中的信念更新，并可作为衡量认知阻力的指标。最后，作者讨论了如何完善该模型以更好地适应现实对话场景的复杂性。研究强调了在人类-AI协作中考虑认知摩擦的重要性。(100字)
