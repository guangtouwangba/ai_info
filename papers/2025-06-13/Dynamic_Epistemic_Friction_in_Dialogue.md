# Dynamic Epistemic Friction in Dialogue

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10934v1

## 原始摘要

Recent developments in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
preferences have significantly enhanced their utility in human-AI collaborative
scenarios. However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of
"epistemic friction," or the inherent resistance encountered when updating
beliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this
paper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic
integration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current
belief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position
this within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit,
2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the
interaction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that
demonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief
updates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief
alignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be
made more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue
scenarios.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文探讨了在人类与AI协作中，大型语言模型(LLMs)与人类偏好对齐时忽略的"认知摩擦"问题。作者将动态认知摩擦定义为智能体现有信念与外部证据支持的新命题之间的错位所产生的认知整合阻力，并基于动态认知逻辑框架进行分析。研究表明，这种认知摩擦模型能有效预测对话中的信念更新。论文还讨论了如何将信念对齐作为认知阻力或摩擦的衡量标准，使其更复杂以适应现实对话场景。该研究为理解人机协作中的认知障碍提供了新视角。
