## 原始摘要

The flourishing of video generation technologies has endangered the
credibility of real-world information and intensified the demand for
AI-generated video detectors. Despite some progress, the lack of high-quality
real-world datasets hinders the development of trustworthy detectors. In this
paper, we propose GenWorld, a large-scale, high-quality, and real-world
simulation dataset for AI-generated video detection. GenWorld features the
following characteristics: (1) Real-world Simulation: GenWorld focuses on
videos that replicate real-world scenarios, which have a significant impact due
to their realism and potential influence; (2) High Quality: GenWorld employs
multiple state-of-the-art video generation models to provide realistic and
high-quality forged videos; (3) Cross-prompt Diversity: GenWorld includes
videos generated from diverse generators and various prompt modalities (e.g.,
text, image, video), offering the potential to learn more generalizable
forensic features. We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect
high-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing
potential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues. To address this, we propose a
simple yet effective model, SpannDetector, to leverage multi-view consistency
as a strong criterion for real-world AI-generated video detection. Experiments
show that our method achieves superior results, highlighting a promising
direction for explainable AI-generated video detection based on physical
plausibility. We believe that GenWorld will advance the field of AI-generated
video detection. Project Page: https://chen-wl20.github.io/GenWorld


## AI 摘要

这篇论文提出了GenWorld，一个用于AI生成视频检测的大规模、高质量、真实场景模拟数据集。GenWorld具有三大特点：1)真实场景模拟，关注对现实世界有重大影响的逼真视频；2)高质量，采用多种先进视频生成模型；3)跨提示多样性，包含不同生成器和多种提示方式生成的视频。研究发现现有方法难以检测世界模型生成的高质量视频，因此作者提出SpannDetector模型，利用多视角一致性作为检测标准。实验表明该方法效果显著，为基于物理合理性的可解释AI视频检测提供了新方向。数据集将推动该领域发展。
