# SoK: Watermarking for AI-Generated Content

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18479v3

## 原始摘要

As the outputs of generative AI (GenAI) techniques improve in quality, it
becomes increasingly challenging to distinguish them from human-created
content. Watermarking schemes are a promising approach to address the problem
of distinguishing between AI and human-generated content. These schemes embed
hidden signals within AI-generated content to enable reliable detection. While
watermarking is not a silver bullet for addressing all risks associated with
GenAI, it can play a crucial role in enhancing AI safety and trustworthiness by
combating misinformation and deception. This paper presents a comprehensive
overview of watermarking techniques for GenAI, beginning with the need for
watermarking from historical and regulatory perspectives. We formalize the
definitions and desired properties of watermarking schemes and examine the key
objectives and threat models for existing approaches. Practical evaluation
strategies are also explored, providing insights into the development of robust
watermarking techniques capable of resisting various attacks. Additionally, we
review recent representative works, highlight open challenges, and discuss
potential directions for this emerging field. By offering a thorough
understanding of watermarking in GenAI, this work aims to guide researchers in
advancing watermarking methods and applications, and support policymakers in
addressing the broader implications of GenAI.


## AI 摘要

随着生成式AI（GenAI）输出质量提升，区分AI与人类生成内容愈发困难。数字水印技术通过嵌入隐藏信号实现可靠检测，成为解决该问题的有效方案。本文系统梳理了GenAI水印技术，从历史与监管角度阐述了水印的必要性，明确了水印方案的定义、特性及核心目标，分析了现有方法的威胁模型。研究探讨了抗攻击水印的评估策略，综述了代表性工作，并指出该领域的开放挑战与发展方向。水印技术虽非万能，但在对抗AI生成内容的误导与欺骗、增强AI安全可信方面具有关键作用，为研究者和政策制定者提供了重要参考。
