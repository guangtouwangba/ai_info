# SoK: Watermarking for AI-Generated Content

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18479v3

## 原始摘要

As the outputs of generative AI (GenAI) techniques improve in quality, it
becomes increasingly challenging to distinguish them from human-created
content. Watermarking schemes are a promising approach to address the problem
of distinguishing between AI and human-generated content. These schemes embed
hidden signals within AI-generated content to enable reliable detection. While
watermarking is not a silver bullet for addressing all risks associated with
GenAI, it can play a crucial role in enhancing AI safety and trustworthiness by
combating misinformation and deception. This paper presents a comprehensive
overview of watermarking techniques for GenAI, beginning with the need for
watermarking from historical and regulatory perspectives. We formalize the
definitions and desired properties of watermarking schemes and examine the key
objectives and threat models for existing approaches. Practical evaluation
strategies are also explored, providing insights into the development of robust
watermarking techniques capable of resisting various attacks. Additionally, we
review recent representative works, highlight open challenges, and discuss
potential directions for this emerging field. By offering a thorough
understanding of watermarking in GenAI, this work aims to guide researchers in
advancing watermarking methods and applications, and support policymakers in
addressing the broader implications of GenAI.


## AI 摘要

随着生成式AI（GenAI）输出质量的提升，区分AI与人类生成内容变得愈发困难。数字水印技术通过嵌入隐藏信号实现可靠检测，成为解决这一问题的有效手段。虽然水印并非应对GenAI所有风险的万能方案，但它在打击错误信息和欺骗行为、增强AI安全性与可信度方面至关重要。本文系统梳理了GenAI水印技术，从历史与监管需求出发，明确了水印的定义、特性及核心目标，分析了现有方法的威胁模型与评估策略，并探讨了抗攻击鲁棒水印的发展。最后总结了代表性研究、开放挑战与未来方向，为研究者和政策制定者提供参考。
