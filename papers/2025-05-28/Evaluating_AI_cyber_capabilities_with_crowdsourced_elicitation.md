# Evaluating AI cyber capabilities with crowdsourced elicitation

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19915v2

## 原始摘要

As AI systems become increasingly capable, understanding their offensive
cyber potential is critical for informed governance and responsible deployment.
However, it's hard to accurately bound their capabilities, and some prior
evaluations dramatically underestimated them. The art of extracting maximum
task-specific performance from AIs is called "AI elicitation", and today's
safety organizations typically conduct it in-house. In this paper, we explore
crowdsourcing elicitation efforts as an alternative to in-house elicitation
work.
  We host open-access AI tracks at two Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions: AI
vs. Humans (400 teams) and Cyber Apocalypse (8000 teams). The AI teams achieve
outstanding performance at both events, ranking top-5% and top-10% respectively
for a total of \$7500 in bounties. This impressive performance suggests that
open-market elicitation may offer an effective complement to in-house
elicitation. We propose elicitation bounties as a practical mechanism for
maintaining timely, cost-effective situational awareness of emerging AI
capabilities.
  Another advantage of open elicitations is the option to collect human
performance data at scale. Applying METR's methodology, we found that AI agents
can reliably solve cyber challenges requiring one hour or less of effort from a
median human CTF participant.


## AI 摘要

随着AI能力不断提升，评估其网络攻防潜力对治理和部署至关重要。本研究通过在两项CTF竞赛（400队和8000队参赛）中设置公开AI赛道，发现AI团队表现优异（前5%和前10%），赢得7500美元奖金，表明众包式激发（elicitation）可作为内部评估的有效补充。研究建议设立"AI能力悬赏"机制，以经济高效地追踪AI前沿能力。另一优势是可大规模收集人类表现数据，分析显示AI能可靠解决中位人类选手1小时内完成的网络攻防挑战。这为AI能力评估提供了新思路。
