# Evaluating AI cyber capabilities with crowdsourced elicitation

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19915v2

## 原始摘要

As AI systems become increasingly capable, understanding their offensive
cyber potential is critical for informed governance and responsible deployment.
However, it's hard to accurately bound their capabilities, and some prior
evaluations dramatically underestimated them. The art of extracting maximum
task-specific performance from AIs is called "AI elicitation", and today's
safety organizations typically conduct it in-house. In this paper, we explore
crowdsourcing elicitation efforts as an alternative to in-house elicitation
work.
  We host open-access AI tracks at two Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions: AI
vs. Humans (400 teams) and Cyber Apocalypse (8000 teams). The AI teams achieve
outstanding performance at both events, ranking top-5% and top-10% respectively
for a total of \$7500 in bounties. This impressive performance suggests that
open-market elicitation may offer an effective complement to in-house
elicitation. We propose elicitation bounties as a practical mechanism for
maintaining timely, cost-effective situational awareness of emerging AI
capabilities.
  Another advantage of open elicitations is the option to collect human
performance data at scale. Applying METR's methodology, we found that AI agents
can reliably solve cyber challenges requiring one hour or less of effort from a
median human CTF participant.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文探讨了通过众包方式激发AI在网络安全领域的潜力。研究团队在两场CTF比赛（AI vs. Humans和Cyber Apocalypse）中设置了公开AI赛道，AI团队表现优异，分别进入前5%和前10%，共获得7500美元奖金。结果表明，开放市场激发可能比内部测试更有效，建议采用悬赏机制来持续评估新兴AI能力。研究还发现，AI能可靠解决普通人类参赛者1小时内完成的网络挑战。开放测试可大规模收集人类表现数据，为AI能力评估提供了新方法。
