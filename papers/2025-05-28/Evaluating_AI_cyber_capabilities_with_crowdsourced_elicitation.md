# Evaluating AI cyber capabilities with crowdsourced elicitation

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19915v2

## 原始摘要

As AI systems become increasingly capable, understanding their offensive
cyber potential is critical for informed governance and responsible deployment.
However, it's hard to accurately bound their capabilities, and some prior
evaluations dramatically underestimated them. The art of extracting maximum
task-specific performance from AIs is called "AI elicitation", and today's
safety organizations typically conduct it in-house. In this paper, we explore
crowdsourcing elicitation efforts as an alternative to in-house elicitation
work.
  We host open-access AI tracks at two Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions: AI
vs. Humans (400 teams) and Cyber Apocalypse (8000 teams). The AI teams achieve
outstanding performance at both events, ranking top-5% and top-10% respectively
for a total of \$7500 in bounties. This impressive performance suggests that
open-market elicitation may offer an effective complement to in-house
elicitation. We propose elicitation bounties as a practical mechanism for
maintaining timely, cost-effective situational awareness of emerging AI
capabilities.
  Another advantage of open elicitations is the option to collect human
performance data at scale. Applying METR's methodology, we found that AI agents
can reliably solve cyber challenges requiring one hour or less of effort from a
median human CTF participant.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了通过众包方式激发AI网络攻防潜力的可行性。研究团队在两场网络安全夺旗赛（CTF）中设立公开AI赛道，分别吸引400支和8000支队伍参与。结果显示AI团队表现优异，分别进入前5%和前10%，共获得7500美元奖金。这表明开放市场激发可能成为内部评估的有效补充。研究建议采用悬赏机制来持续跟踪AI新兴能力。此外，通过大规模收集人类表现数据发现，AI能可靠解决中位人类选手1小时内完成的网络挑战。这为AI能力评估提供了新思路。
