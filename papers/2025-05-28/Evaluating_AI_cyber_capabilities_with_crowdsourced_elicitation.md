# Evaluating AI cyber capabilities with crowdsourced elicitation

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19915v2

## 原始摘要

As AI systems become increasingly capable, understanding their offensive
cyber potential is critical for informed governance and responsible deployment.
However, it's hard to accurately bound their capabilities, and some prior
evaluations dramatically underestimated them. The art of extracting maximum
task-specific performance from AIs is called "AI elicitation", and today's
safety organizations typically conduct it in-house. In this paper, we explore
crowdsourcing elicitation efforts as an alternative to in-house elicitation
work.
  We host open-access AI tracks at two Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions: AI
vs. Humans (400 teams) and Cyber Apocalypse (8000 teams). The AI teams achieve
outstanding performance at both events, ranking top-5% and top-10% respectively
for a total of \$7500 in bounties. This impressive performance suggests that
open-market elicitation may offer an effective complement to in-house
elicitation. We propose elicitation bounties as a practical mechanism for
maintaining timely, cost-effective situational awareness of emerging AI
capabilities.
  Another advantage of open elicitations is the option to collect human
performance data at scale. Applying METR's methodology, we found that AI agents
can reliably solve cyber challenges requiring one hour or less of effort from a
median human CTF participant.


## AI 摘要

随着AI系统能力增强，评估其网络攻击潜力对治理和部署至关重要。传统内部评估常低估AI能力，而通过众包方式（如在CTF比赛中设置公开AI赛道）能更有效激发AI潜力。两项比赛（400和8000支队伍）中，AI团队表现优异（前5%和前10%），赢得7500美元奖金，证明开放市场激发可作为内部评估的有效补充。研究者建议设立"AI能力悬赏"机制，以经济高效地追踪AI新兴能力。开放评估还能大规模收集人类表现数据，分析显示AI能可靠解决普通CTF选手1小时内完成的网络挑战。
