# Evaluating AI cyber capabilities with crowdsourced elicitation

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19915v2

## 原始摘要

As AI systems become increasingly capable, understanding their offensive
cyber potential is critical for informed governance and responsible deployment.
However, it's hard to accurately bound their capabilities, and some prior
evaluations dramatically underestimated them. The art of extracting maximum
task-specific performance from AIs is called "AI elicitation", and today's
safety organizations typically conduct it in-house. In this paper, we explore
crowdsourcing elicitation efforts as an alternative to in-house elicitation
work.
  We host open-access AI tracks at two Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions: AI
vs. Humans (400 teams) and Cyber Apocalypse (8000 teams). The AI teams achieve
outstanding performance at both events, ranking top-5% and top-10% respectively
for a total of \$7500 in bounties. This impressive performance suggests that
open-market elicitation may offer an effective complement to in-house
elicitation. We propose elicitation bounties as a practical mechanism for
maintaining timely, cost-effective situational awareness of emerging AI
capabilities.
  Another advantage of open elicitations is the option to collect human
performance data at scale. Applying METR's methodology, we found that AI agents
can reliably solve cyber challenges requiring one hour or less of effort from a
median human CTF participant.


## AI 摘要

随着AI系统能力提升，评估其网络攻防潜力对治理和部署至关重要。传统内部评估常低估AI能力，而本研究通过众包模式探索替代方案。研究团队在两场网络安全夺旗赛（400队和8000队规模）中设置AI赛道，AI团队表现优异（前5%和前10%），共获7500美元奖金，证明开放市场激发能有效补充内部评估。研究建议设立"能力激发奖金"机制，以经济高效的方式跟踪AI发展。同时，开放测试可大规模采集人类表现数据，分析显示AI能可靠解决普通参赛者1小时内完成的任务。
