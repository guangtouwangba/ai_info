# Silence is Not Consensus: Disrupting Agreement Bias in Multi-Agent LLMs via Catfish Agent for Clinical Decision Making

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21503v1

## 原始摘要

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential in clinical
question answering, with recent multi-agent frameworks further improving
diagnostic accuracy via collaborative reasoning. However, we identify a
recurring issue of Silent Agreement, where agents prematurely converge on
diagnoses without sufficient critical analysis, particularly in complex or
ambiguous cases. We present a new concept called Catfish Agent, a
role-specialized LLM designed to inject structured dissent and counter silent
agreement. Inspired by the ``catfish effect'' in organizational psychology, the
Catfish Agent is designed to challenge emerging consensus to stimulate deeper
reasoning. We formulate two mechanisms to encourage effective and context-aware
interventions: (i) a complexity-aware intervention that modulates agent
engagement based on case difficulty, and (ii) a tone-calibrated intervention
articulated to balance critique and collaboration. Evaluations on nine medical
Q&amp;A and three medical VQA benchmarks show that our approach consistently
outperforms both single- and multi-agent LLMs frameworks, including leading
commercial models such as GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1.


## AI 摘要

该研究针对大型语言模型(LLMs)在临床问答中存在的"沉默共识"问题(即智能体过早达成诊断结论)，提出"鲶鱼代理"(Catfish Agent)的创新解决方案。受组织心理学"鲶鱼效应"启发，该代理通过两种机制主动质疑共识：1)基于病例复杂度的干预调节；2)平衡批评与合作的语气校准。在9个医疗问答和3个医疗视觉问答基准测试中，该方法显著优于单/多智能体LLMs框架及GPT-4o等商业模型，有效提升了复杂病例的诊断准确性。
