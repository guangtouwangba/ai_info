# Silence is Not Consensus: Disrupting Agreement Bias in Multi-Agent LLMs via Catfish Agent for Clinical Decision Making

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21503v1

## 原始摘要

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential in clinical
question answering, with recent multi-agent frameworks further improving
diagnostic accuracy via collaborative reasoning. However, we identify a
recurring issue of Silent Agreement, where agents prematurely converge on
diagnoses without sufficient critical analysis, particularly in complex or
ambiguous cases. We present a new concept called Catfish Agent, a
role-specialized LLM designed to inject structured dissent and counter silent
agreement. Inspired by the ``catfish effect'' in organizational psychology, the
Catfish Agent is designed to challenge emerging consensus to stimulate deeper
reasoning. We formulate two mechanisms to encourage effective and context-aware
interventions: (i) a complexity-aware intervention that modulates agent
engagement based on case difficulty, and (ii) a tone-calibrated intervention
articulated to balance critique and collaboration. Evaluations on nine medical
Q&amp;A and three medical VQA benchmarks show that our approach consistently
outperforms both single- and multi-agent LLMs frameworks, including leading
commercial models such as GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1.


## AI 摘要

该研究针对大型语言模型(LLMs)在临床问答中存在的"沉默共识"问题，提出了一种新型"鲶鱼代理"机制。该机制通过引入专门角色来系统性地提出异议，防止多智能体过早达成诊断共识。研究设计了两种干预策略：基于病例复杂度的智能体参与调节和平衡批评与合作的语气校准干预。在12个医疗问答基准测试中，该方法显著优于单智能体和多智能体框架，包括GPT-4o和DeepSeek-R1等领先商业模型，有效提升了复杂或模糊病例的诊断准确性。
