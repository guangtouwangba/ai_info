# Agents Require Metacognitive and Strategic Reasoning to Succeed in the Coming Labor Markets

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20120v1

## 原始摘要

Current labor markets are strongly affected by the economic forces of adverse
selection, moral hazard, and reputation, each of which arises due to
$\textit{incomplete information}$. These economic forces will still be
influential after AI agents are introduced, and thus, agents must use
metacognitive and strategic reasoning to perform effectively. Metacognition is
a form of $\textit{internal reasoning}$ that includes the capabilities for
self-assessment, task understanding, and evaluation of strategies. Strategic
reasoning is $\textit{external reasoning}$ that covers holding beliefs about
other participants in the labor market (e.g., competitors, colleagues), making
strategic decisions, and learning about others over time. Both types of
reasoning are required by agents as they decide among the many
$\textit{actions}$ they can take in labor markets, both within and outside
their jobs. We discuss current research into metacognitive and strategic
reasoning and the areas requiring further development.


## AI 摘要

当前劳动力市场深受信息不对称导致的逆向选择、道德风险和声誉问题影响。即便引入AI代理后，这些经济力量仍将持续作用，因此代理需具备元认知和战略推理能力。元认知作为内部推理，包括自我评估、任务理解和策略评价；战略推理作为外部推理，涉及对市场参与者（如竞争者、同事）的认知、战略决策和持续学习。代理在劳动力市场内外采取行动时，需同时运用这两种推理方式。研究正在探索这些能力，但仍需进一步发展相关领域。
