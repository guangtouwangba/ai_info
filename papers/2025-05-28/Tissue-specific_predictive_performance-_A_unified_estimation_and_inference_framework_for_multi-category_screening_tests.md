# Tissue-specific predictive performance: A unified estimation and inference framework for multi-category screening tests

## 原始摘要

Multi-Cancer Early Detection (MCED) testing with tissue localization aims to
detect and identify multiple cancer types from a single blood sample. Such
tests have the potential to aid clinical decisions and significantly improve
health outcomes. Despite this promise, MCED testing has not yet achieved
regulatory approval, reimbursement or broad clinical adoption. One major reason
for this shortcoming is uncertainty about test performance resulting from the
reporting of clinically obtuse metrics. Traditionally, MCED tests report
aggregate measures of test performance, disregarding cancer type, that obscure
biological variability and underlying differences in the test's behavior,
limiting insight into true effectiveness. Clinically informative evaluation of
an MCED test's performance requires metrics that are specific to cancer types.
In the context of a case-control sampling design, this paper derives analytical
methods that estimate cancer-specific intrinsic accuracy, tissue localization
readout-specific predictive value and the marginal test classification
distribution, each with corresponding confidence interval formulae. A
simulation study is presented that evaluates performance of the proposed
methodology and provides guidance for implementation. An application to a
published MCED test dataset is given. These statistical approaches allow for
estimation and inference for the pointed metric of an MCED test that allow its
evaluation to support a potential role in early cancer detection. This
framework enables more precise clinical decision-making, supports optimized
trial designs across classical, digital, AI-driven, and hybrid stratified
diagnostic screening platforms, and facilitates informed healthcare decisions
by clinicians, policymakers, regulators, scientists, and patients.


## AI 摘要

多癌种早期检测(MCED)技术通过单次血液检测可识别多种癌症类型并定位组织来源，有望改善临床决策和健康结果。然而，当前测试采用模糊的总体性能指标，掩盖了不同癌症类型的检测差异，阻碍了临床应用。本研究开发了新型统计方法，可精确评估癌症特异性检测准确率、组织定位预测值和分类分布，并提供置信区间。通过模拟研究和实际数据验证，该方法能更准确评估MCED检测性能，支持优化临床试验设计，帮助医疗决策者、监管机构和患者做出更明智的选择。这一框架适用于传统、数字、AI驱动和混合诊断平台。
