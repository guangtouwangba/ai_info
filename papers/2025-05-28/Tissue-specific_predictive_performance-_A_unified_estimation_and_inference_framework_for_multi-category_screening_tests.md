# Tissue-specific predictive performance: A unified estimation and inference framework for multi-category screening tests

## 原始摘要

Multi-Cancer Early Detection (MCED) testing with tissue localization aims to
detect and identify multiple cancer types from a single blood sample. Such
tests have the potential to aid clinical decisions and significantly improve
health outcomes. Despite this promise, MCED testing has not yet achieved
regulatory approval, reimbursement or broad clinical adoption. One major reason
for this shortcoming is uncertainty about test performance resulting from the
reporting of clinically obtuse metrics. Traditionally, MCED tests report
aggregate measures of test performance, disregarding cancer type, that obscure
biological variability and underlying differences in the test's behavior,
limiting insight into true effectiveness. Clinically informative evaluation of
an MCED test's performance requires metrics that are specific to cancer types.
In the context of a case-control sampling design, this paper derives analytical
methods that estimate cancer-specific intrinsic accuracy, tissue localization
readout-specific predictive value and the marginal test classification
distribution, each with corresponding confidence interval formulae. A
simulation study is presented that evaluates performance of the proposed
methodology and provides guidance for implementation. An application to a
published MCED test dataset is given. These statistical approaches allow for
estimation and inference for the pointed metric of an MCED test that allow its
evaluation to support a potential role in early cancer detection. This
framework enables more precise clinical decision-making, supports optimized
trial designs across classical, digital, AI-driven, and hybrid stratified
diagnostic screening platforms, and facilitates informed healthcare decisions
by clinicians, policymakers, regulators, scientists, and patients.


## AI 摘要

多癌早期检测(MCED)技术通过单次血液检测实现多种癌症的早期发现和组织定位，具有改善临床预后的潜力。但当前该技术尚未获得监管批准或广泛应用，主要原因是传统评估方法采用笼统的性能指标，掩盖了不同癌症类型的检测差异。本研究提出新型统计方法，可精确评估癌症特异性检测准确率、组织定位预测值等关键指标，并提供置信区间计算。通过模拟研究和实际数据验证，该方法能更准确地评估MCED检测性能，为临床决策、试验设计和监管审批提供科学依据，推动该技术在分层诊断平台中的应用。
