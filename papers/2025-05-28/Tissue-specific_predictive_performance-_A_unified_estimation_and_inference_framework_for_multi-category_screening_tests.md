# Tissue-specific predictive performance: A unified estimation and inference framework for multi-category screening tests

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21482v1

## 原始摘要

Multi-Cancer Early Detection (MCED) testing with tissue localization aims to
detect and identify multiple cancer types from a single blood sample. Such
tests have the potential to aid clinical decisions and significantly improve
health outcomes. Despite this promise, MCED testing has not yet achieved
regulatory approval, reimbursement or broad clinical adoption. One major reason
for this shortcoming is uncertainty about test performance resulting from the
reporting of clinically obtuse metrics. Traditionally, MCED tests report
aggregate measures of test performance, disregarding cancer type, that obscure
biological variability and underlying differences in the test's behavior,
limiting insight into true effectiveness. Clinically informative evaluation of
an MCED test's performance requires metrics that are specific to cancer types.
In the context of a case-control sampling design, this paper derives analytical
methods that estimate cancer-specific intrinsic accuracy, tissue localization
readout-specific predictive value and the marginal test classification
distribution, each with corresponding confidence interval formulae. A
simulation study is presented that evaluates performance of the proposed
methodology and provides guidance for implementation. An application to a
published MCED test dataset is given. These statistical approaches allow for
estimation and inference for the pointed metric of an MCED test that allow its
evaluation to support a potential role in early cancer detection. This
framework enables more precise clinical decision-making, supports optimized
trial designs across classical, digital, AI-driven, and hybrid stratified
diagnostic screening platforms, and facilitates informed healthcare decisions
by clinicians, policymakers, regulators, scientists, and patients.


## AI 摘要

多癌早期检测（MCED）技术通过单次血液样本检测和定位多种癌症，有望改善临床决策和健康结果。然而，由于传统性能评估采用模糊的综合性指标，掩盖了癌症类型间的生物学差异和检测行为差异，导致其尚未获得监管批准或广泛应用。本研究提出癌症特异性评估方法，包括类型特异性准确率、组织定位预测值和分类分布估计，并提供置信区间计算。通过模拟实验验证方法性能，并应用于公开数据集。该框架支持精准临床决策，优化传统/数字/AI分层筛查试验设计，助力多方制定知情医疗决策。
