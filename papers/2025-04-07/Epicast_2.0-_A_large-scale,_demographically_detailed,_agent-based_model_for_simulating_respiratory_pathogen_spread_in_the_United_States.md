# Epicast 2.0: A large-scale, demographically detailed, agent-based model for simulating respiratory pathogen spread in the United States

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03604v1

## 原始摘要

The recent history of respiratory pathogen epidemics, including those caused
by influenza and SARS-CoV-2, has highlighted the urgent need for advanced
modeling approaches that can accurately capture heterogeneous disease dynamics
and outcomes at the national scale, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of
resource allocation and decision-making. In this paper, we describe Epicast
2.0, an agent-based model that utilizes a highly detailed, synthetic population
and high-performance computing techniques to simulate respiratory pathogen
transmission across the entire United States. This model replicates the contact
patterns of over 320 million agents as they engage in daily activities at
school, work, and within their communities. Epicast 2.0 supports vaccination
and an array of non-pharmaceutical interventions that can be promoted or
relaxed via highly granular, user specified policies. We illustrate the model's
capabilities using a wide range of outbreak scenarios, highlighting the model's
varied dynamics as well as its extensive support for policy exploration. This
model provides a robust platform for conducting what if scenario analysis and
providing insights into potential strategies for mitigating the impacts of
infectious diseases.


## AI 摘要

近期流感与新冠病毒等呼吸道病原体流行凸显了对先进建模方法的迫切需求。本文介绍了Epicast 2.0——一个基于智能体的全国性传染病传播模型，通过高性能计算技术模拟美国3.2亿人口在日常活动中的接触模式。该模型整合了疫苗接种和多种非药物干预措施，支持精细化政策调整，可用于多种疫情情景下的"假设分析"，为资源分配和决策制定提供科学依据。Epicast 2.0为探索传染病防控策略提供了强大平台，能有效模拟不同政策干预下的疾病传播动态。
