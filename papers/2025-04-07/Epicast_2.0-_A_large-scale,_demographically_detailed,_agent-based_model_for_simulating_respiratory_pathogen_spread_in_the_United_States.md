# Epicast 2.0: A large-scale, demographically detailed, agent-based model for simulating respiratory pathogen spread in the United States

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03604v1

## 原始摘要

The recent history of respiratory pathogen epidemics, including those caused
by influenza and SARS-CoV-2, has highlighted the urgent need for advanced
modeling approaches that can accurately capture heterogeneous disease dynamics
and outcomes at the national scale, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of
resource allocation and decision-making. In this paper, we describe Epicast
2.0, an agent-based model that utilizes a highly detailed, synthetic population
and high-performance computing techniques to simulate respiratory pathogen
transmission across the entire United States. This model replicates the contact
patterns of over 320 million agents as they engage in daily activities at
school, work, and within their communities. Epicast 2.0 supports vaccination
and an array of non-pharmaceutical interventions that can be promoted or
relaxed via highly granular, user specified policies. We illustrate the model's
capabilities using a wide range of outbreak scenarios, highlighting the model's
varied dynamics as well as its extensive support for policy exploration. This
model provides a robust platform for conducting what if scenario analysis and
providing insights into potential strategies for mitigating the impacts of
infectious diseases.


## AI 摘要

近期流感与新冠病毒等呼吸道病原体流行凸显了对精准建模工具的迫切需求。Epicast 2.0作为新一代基于智能体的全国尺度传染病模型，通过高性能计算技术模拟美国3.2亿人口日常接触模式（学校/工作/社区场景），支持疫苗接种和精细化非药物干预政策测试。该模型具备多场景暴发模拟能力，可进行"假设分析"以评估不同防控策略效果，为资源优化配置提供决策支持。其高度细粒度的政策模拟功能，为探索传染病应对方案构建了强大研究平台，有助于制定更有效的疫情缓解措施。
