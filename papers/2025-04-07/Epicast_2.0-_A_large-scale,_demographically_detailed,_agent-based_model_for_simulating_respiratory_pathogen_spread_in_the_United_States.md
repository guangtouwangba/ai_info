# Epicast 2.0: A large-scale, demographically detailed, agent-based model for simulating respiratory pathogen spread in the United States

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03604v1

## 原始摘要

The recent history of respiratory pathogen epidemics, including those caused
by influenza and SARS-CoV-2, has highlighted the urgent need for advanced
modeling approaches that can accurately capture heterogeneous disease dynamics
and outcomes at the national scale, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of
resource allocation and decision-making. In this paper, we describe Epicast
2.0, an agent-based model that utilizes a highly detailed, synthetic population
and high-performance computing techniques to simulate respiratory pathogen
transmission across the entire United States. This model replicates the contact
patterns of over 320 million agents as they engage in daily activities at
school, work, and within their communities. Epicast 2.0 supports vaccination
and an array of non-pharmaceutical interventions that can be promoted or
relaxed via highly granular, user specified policies. We illustrate the model's
capabilities using a wide range of outbreak scenarios, highlighting the model's
varied dynamics as well as its extensive support for policy exploration. This
model provides a robust platform for conducting what if scenario analysis and
providing insights into potential strategies for mitigating the impacts of
infectious diseases.


## AI 摘要

Epicast 2.0是一个基于智能体的高精度模型，利用高性能计算技术模拟美国3.2亿人的日常接触模式，以预测呼吸道病原体传播。该模型整合了疫苗接种和非药物干预措施（如学校、工作场所和社区政策），支持精细化政策调整。通过多样化疫情情景测试，Epicast 2.0能动态模拟疾病传播，为决策者提供资源分配和防控策略的"假设分析"平台，助力应对流感、COVID-19等疫情。其高分辨率合成人口数据和多场景政策探索功能，显著提升了国家级传染病应对的精准性和效率。
