# Epicast 2.0: A large-scale, demographically detailed, agent-based model for simulating respiratory pathogen spread in the United States

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03604v1

## 原始摘要

The recent history of respiratory pathogen epidemics, including those caused
by influenza and SARS-CoV-2, has highlighted the urgent need for advanced
modeling approaches that can accurately capture heterogeneous disease dynamics
and outcomes at the national scale, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of
resource allocation and decision-making. In this paper, we describe Epicast
2.0, an agent-based model that utilizes a highly detailed, synthetic population
and high-performance computing techniques to simulate respiratory pathogen
transmission across the entire United States. This model replicates the contact
patterns of over 320 million agents as they engage in daily activities at
school, work, and within their communities. Epicast 2.0 supports vaccination
and an array of non-pharmaceutical interventions that can be promoted or
relaxed via highly granular, user specified policies. We illustrate the model's
capabilities using a wide range of outbreak scenarios, highlighting the model's
varied dynamics as well as its extensive support for policy exploration. This
model provides a robust platform for conducting what if scenario analysis and
providing insights into potential strategies for mitigating the impacts of
infectious diseases.


## AI 摘要

近期呼吸道病原体流行（如流感和SARS-CoV-2）凸显了对国家级精准建模的迫切需求。本文提出Epicast 2.0——基于智能体的高精度模型，通过高性能计算模拟美国3.2亿人口的日常接触模式（学校/工作/社区），支持疫苗接种和非药物干预措施的精细化政策调控。该模型能模拟多样化疫情场景，展现动态传播特征，为"假设分析"提供强大平台，助力资源优化分配和决策制定。其核心价值在于通过合成人口的高分辨率建模，探索不同防控策略对传染病影响的缓解效果。
