# Epicast 2.0: A large-scale, demographically detailed, agent-based model for simulating respiratory pathogen spread in the United States

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03604v1

## 原始摘要

The recent history of respiratory pathogen epidemics, including those caused
by influenza and SARS-CoV-2, has highlighted the urgent need for advanced
modeling approaches that can accurately capture heterogeneous disease dynamics
and outcomes at the national scale, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of
resource allocation and decision-making. In this paper, we describe Epicast
2.0, an agent-based model that utilizes a highly detailed, synthetic population
and high-performance computing techniques to simulate respiratory pathogen
transmission across the entire United States. This model replicates the contact
patterns of over 320 million agents as they engage in daily activities at
school, work, and within their communities. Epicast 2.0 supports vaccination
and an array of non-pharmaceutical interventions that can be promoted or
relaxed via highly granular, user specified policies. We illustrate the model's
capabilities using a wide range of outbreak scenarios, highlighting the model's
varied dynamics as well as its extensive support for policy exploration. This
model provides a robust platform for conducting what if scenario analysis and
providing insights into potential strategies for mitigating the impacts of
infectious diseases.


## AI 摘要

本文介绍了Epicast 2.0，这是一个基于智能体的模型，用于模拟呼吸道病原体在美国全国的传播。该模型利用高度详细的合成人口和高性能计算技术，模拟超过3.2亿个体的日常接触模式（如学校、工作和社区活动）。Epicast 2.0支持疫苗接种和多种非药物干预措施，用户可通过细粒度政策调整干预强度。通过多种疫情场景测试，模型展示了其动态模拟能力和政策探索支持。该平台为"假设"情景分析提供了强大工具，有助于优化资源分配和决策制定，以减轻传染病的影响。
