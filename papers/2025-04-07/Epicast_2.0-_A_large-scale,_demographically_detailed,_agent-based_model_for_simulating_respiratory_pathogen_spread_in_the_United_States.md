# Epicast 2.0: A large-scale, demographically detailed, agent-based model for simulating respiratory pathogen spread in the United States

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03604v1

## 原始摘要

The recent history of respiratory pathogen epidemics, including those caused
by influenza and SARS-CoV-2, has highlighted the urgent need for advanced
modeling approaches that can accurately capture heterogeneous disease dynamics
and outcomes at the national scale, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of
resource allocation and decision-making. In this paper, we describe Epicast
2.0, an agent-based model that utilizes a highly detailed, synthetic population
and high-performance computing techniques to simulate respiratory pathogen
transmission across the entire United States. This model replicates the contact
patterns of over 320 million agents as they engage in daily activities at
school, work, and within their communities. Epicast 2.0 supports vaccination
and an array of non-pharmaceutical interventions that can be promoted or
relaxed via highly granular, user specified policies. We illustrate the model's
capabilities using a wide range of outbreak scenarios, highlighting the model's
varied dynamics as well as its extensive support for policy exploration. This
model provides a robust platform for conducting what if scenario analysis and
providing insights into potential strategies for mitigating the impacts of
infectious diseases.


## AI 摘要

近期流感与新冠病毒等呼吸道病原体流行凸显了对先进建模技术的迫切需求。Epicast 2.0作为新一代基于智能体的模型，通过高性能计算技术模拟全美3.2亿人口日常接触模式，支持疫苗接种和非药物干预措施的精细化政策测试。该模型利用高度详细的合成人口数据，能模拟学校、工作场所及社区中的疾病传播动态，为决策者提供多种疫情情景下的政策评估平台。其突出优势在于支持"假设分析"场景，帮助探索最优防控策略，从而优化资源配置，提升应对传染病大流行的决策效能。
