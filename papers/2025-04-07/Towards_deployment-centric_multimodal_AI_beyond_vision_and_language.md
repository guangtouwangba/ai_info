# Towards deployment-centric multimodal AI beyond vision and language

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03603v1

## 原始摘要

Multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) integrates diverse types of data via
machine learning to improve understanding, prediction, and decision-making
across disciplines such as healthcare, science, and engineering. However, most
multimodal AI advances focus on models for vision and language data, while
their deployability remains a key challenge. We advocate a deployment-centric
workflow that incorporates deployment constraints early to reduce the
likelihood of undeployable solutions, complementing data-centric and
model-centric approaches. We also emphasise deeper integration across multiple
levels of multimodality and multidisciplinary collaboration to significantly
broaden the research scope beyond vision and language. To facilitate this
approach, we identify common multimodal-AI-specific challenges shared across
disciplines and examine three real-world use cases: pandemic response,
self-driving car design, and climate change adaptation, drawing expertise from
healthcare, social science, engineering, science, sustainability, and finance.
By fostering multidisciplinary dialogue and open research practices, our
community can accelerate deployment-centric development for broad societal
impact.


## AI 摘要

多模态人工智能（AI）通过整合多种数据类型提升跨领域的理解、预测和决策能力，但目前研究多集中于视觉与语言模型，实际部署仍面临挑战。本文提出以部署为中心的工作流程，将部署约束提前纳入考量，避免不可行的方案，并强调多模态多层次整合及跨学科合作，以拓展研究范围。通过分析疫情应对、自动驾驶设计及气候变化适应三个案例，研究揭示了跨学科共有的多模态AI挑战。倡导多学科对话与开放研究实践，以加速部署导向的开发，实现广泛社会影响。
