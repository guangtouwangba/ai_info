# Towards deployment-centric multimodal AI beyond vision and language

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03603v1

## 原始摘要

Multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) integrates diverse types of data via
machine learning to improve understanding, prediction, and decision-making
across disciplines such as healthcare, science, and engineering. However, most
multimodal AI advances focus on models for vision and language data, while
their deployability remains a key challenge. We advocate a deployment-centric
workflow that incorporates deployment constraints early to reduce the
likelihood of undeployable solutions, complementing data-centric and
model-centric approaches. We also emphasise deeper integration across multiple
levels of multimodality and multidisciplinary collaboration to significantly
broaden the research scope beyond vision and language. To facilitate this
approach, we identify common multimodal-AI-specific challenges shared across
disciplines and examine three real-world use cases: pandemic response,
self-driving car design, and climate change adaptation, drawing expertise from
healthcare, social science, engineering, science, sustainability, and finance.
By fostering multidisciplinary dialogue and open research practices, our
community can accelerate deployment-centric development for broad societal
impact.


## AI 摘要

多模态人工智能（AI）通过整合多种数据类型来提升跨领域的理解与决策能力，但当前研究多集中于视觉与语言模型，且部署仍是主要挑战。本文提出以部署为中心的工作流程，早期纳入部署限制以避免不可行方案，并强调跨模态层级和多学科协作以拓展研究范围。通过分析疫情应对、自动驾驶和气候变化适应三个案例，研究揭示了多模态AI的共性挑战，涉及医疗、工程、金融等多个领域。倡导多学科对话与开放研究，以加速可部署AI的发展，实现广泛社会影响。
