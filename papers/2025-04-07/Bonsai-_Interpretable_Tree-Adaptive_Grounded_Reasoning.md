# Bonsai: Interpretable Tree-Adaptive Grounded Reasoning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03640v1

## 原始摘要

To develop general-purpose collaborative agents, humans need reliable AI
systems that can (1) adapt to new domains and (2) transparently reason with
uncertainty to allow for verification and correction. Black-box models
demonstrate powerful data processing abilities but do not satisfy these
criteria due to their opaqueness, domain specificity, and lack of uncertainty
awareness. We introduce Bonsai, a compositional and probabilistic reasoning
system that generates adaptable inference trees by retrieving relevant
grounding evidence and using it to compute likelihoods of sub-claims derived
from broader natural language inferences. Bonsai's reasoning power is tunable
at test-time via evidence scaling and it demonstrates reliable handling of
varied domains including transcripts, photographs, videos, audio, and
databases. Question-answering and human alignment experiments demonstrate that
Bonsai matches the performance of domain-specific black-box methods while
generating interpretable, grounded, and uncertainty-aware reasoning traces.


## AI 摘要

本文介绍了Bonsai，一个可组合的概率推理系统，旨在开发适应性强且透明的通用协作AI代理。与不透明的黑盒模型不同，Bonsai通过检索相关证据并计算子主张的似然概率，生成可调整的推理树。该系统支持多种数据类型（如文本、图像、视频等），并通过证据缩放实现推理能力的动态调节。实验表明，Bonsai在保持与领域专用黑盒模型相当性能的同时，能生成可解释、有依据且具备不确定性意识的推理过程，满足了人类对可验证、可修正AI系统的需求。
