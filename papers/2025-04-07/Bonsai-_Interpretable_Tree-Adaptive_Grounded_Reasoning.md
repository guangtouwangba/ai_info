# Bonsai: Interpretable Tree-Adaptive Grounded Reasoning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03640v1

## 原始摘要

To develop general-purpose collaborative agents, humans need reliable AI
systems that can (1) adapt to new domains and (2) transparently reason with
uncertainty to allow for verification and correction. Black-box models
demonstrate powerful data processing abilities but do not satisfy these
criteria due to their opaqueness, domain specificity, and lack of uncertainty
awareness. We introduce Bonsai, a compositional and probabilistic reasoning
system that generates adaptable inference trees by retrieving relevant
grounding evidence and using it to compute likelihoods of sub-claims derived
from broader natural language inferences. Bonsai's reasoning power is tunable
at test-time via evidence scaling and it demonstrates reliable handling of
varied domains including transcripts, photographs, videos, audio, and
databases. Question-answering and human alignment experiments demonstrate that
Bonsai matches the performance of domain-specific black-box methods while
generating interpretable, grounded, and uncertainty-aware reasoning traces.


## AI 摘要

Bonsai是一种可组合的概率推理系统，旨在开发通用协作AI代理。它通过检索相关证据并计算自然语言推理子主张的似然度，生成可调整的推理树。与黑盒模型不同，Bonsai具有领域适应性、透明推理和不确定性感知能力，支持验证和修正。其推理能力可通过证据规模调整，适用于文本、图像、视频、音频和数据库等多种领域。实验表明，Bonsai在问答任务中性能媲美领域专用黑盒方法，同时能生成可解释、有依据且包含不确定性评估的推理过程，实现了可靠的人类对齐。
