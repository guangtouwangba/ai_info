# A Framework for Situating Innovations, Opportunities, and Challenges in Advancing Vertical Systems with Large AI Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02793v1

## 原始摘要

Large artificial intelligence (AI) models have garnered significant attention
for their remarkable, often "superhuman", performance on standardized
benchmarks. However, when these models are deployed in high-stakes verticals
such as healthcare, education, and law, they often reveal notable limitations.
For instance, they exhibit brittleness to minor variations in input data,
present contextually uninformed decisions in critical settings, and undermine
user trust by confidently producing or reproducing inaccuracies. These
challenges in applying large models necessitate cross-disciplinary innovations
to align the models' capabilities with the needs of real-world applications. We
introduce a framework that addresses this gap through a layer-wise abstraction
of innovations aimed at meeting users' requirements with large models. Through
multiple case studies, we illustrate how researchers and practitioners across
various fields can operationalize this framework. Beyond modularizing the
pipeline of transforming large models into useful "vertical systems", we also
highlight the dynamism that exists within different layers of the framework.
Finally, we discuss how our framework can guide researchers and practitioners
to (i) optimally situate their innovations (e.g., when vertical-specific
insights can empower broadly impactful vertical-agnostic innovations), (ii)
uncover overlooked opportunities (e.g., spotting recurring problems across
verticals to develop practically useful foundation models instead of chasing
benchmarks), and (iii) facilitate cross-disciplinary communication of critical
challenges (e.g., enabling a shared vocabulary for AI developers, domain
experts, and human-computer interaction scholars).


## AI 摘要

大型AI模型虽然在标准化测试中表现优异，但在医疗、教育、法律等高风险领域应用时存在明显缺陷，如对输入数据细微变化敏感、关键场景下决策缺乏上下文理解、错误输出损害用户信任等。为此，研究者提出分层创新框架，通过模块化方法将大模型转化为实用垂直系统，并强调各层级的动态协同。该框架能帮助研究者：(1)定位创新方向，(2)发现跨领域共性需求以开发实用基础模型，(3)促进跨学科交流。案例研究表明，该框架可有效协调模型能力与实际应用需求的差距。
