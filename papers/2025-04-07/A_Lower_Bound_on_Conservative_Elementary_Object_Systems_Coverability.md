# A Lower Bound on Conservative Elementary Object Systems Coverability

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03591v1

## 原始摘要

Elementary Object Systems (EOS) are a form of Petri Net (PN) where tokens
carry internal PN. This model has been recently proposed for analysis of
robustness of Multi Agent Systems. While EOS reachability is known to be
undecidable, the decidability of coverability of its conservative fragment
(where the type of internal PN cannot be completely deleted and, thus, is
conserved) was proved a decade ago, no study charted its complexity. Here, we
take a first step in this direction, by showing how to encode $\nu$PNs, a well
studied form of PN enriched with data, into conservative EOS (cEOS). This
yields a non-Primitive Recursive, $F_{\omega2}$ lower-bound on cEOS
coverability.


## AI 摘要

本文研究了保守性基本对象系统（cEOS）的覆盖问题复杂度。cEOS是一种令牌携带内部Petri网的扩展Petri网模型，其覆盖问题虽已被证明可判定，但复杂度尚未明确。作者通过将带有数据的νPN编码为cEOS，首次建立了cEOS覆盖问题的复杂度下界，证明其至少是非原始递归的Fω2级别。这一结果为理解cEOS的计算复杂性迈出了重要一步，揭示了该模型在处理多智能体系统鲁棒性分析时的内在计算难度。
