# A Lower Bound on Conservative Elementary Object Systems Coverability

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03591v1

## 原始摘要

Elementary Object Systems (EOS) are a form of Petri Net (PN) where tokens
carry internal PN. This model has been recently proposed for analysis of
robustness of Multi Agent Systems. While EOS reachability is known to be
undecidable, the decidability of coverability of its conservative fragment
(where the type of internal PN cannot be completely deleted and, thus, is
conserved) was proved a decade ago, no study charted its complexity. Here, we
take a first step in this direction, by showing how to encode $\nu$PNs, a well
studied form of PN enriched with data, into conservative EOS (cEOS). This
yields a non-Primitive Recursive, $F_{\omega2}$ lower-bound on cEOS
coverability.


## AI 摘要

基本对象系统（EOS）是一种带有内部Petri网（PN）标记的高级Petri网模型，用于分析多智能体系统的鲁棒性。虽然EOS的可达性已被证明是不可判定的，但其保守片段（cEOS，内部PN类型不能被完全删除）的可覆盖性在十年前被证明是可判定的，但复杂度尚未研究。本文首次通过将数据增强型PN（νPN）编码为cEOS，揭示了cEOS可覆盖性的复杂度下界为非原始递归的Fω2级别。这一结果为理解cEOS的计算复杂性迈出了重要一步。（99字）
