# A Lower Bound on Conservative Elementary Object Systems Coverability

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03591v1

## 原始摘要

Elementary Object Systems (EOS) are a form of Petri Net (PN) where tokens
carry internal PN. This model has been recently proposed for analysis of
robustness of Multi Agent Systems. While EOS reachability is known to be
undecidable, the decidability of coverability of its conservative fragment
(where the type of internal PN cannot be completely deleted and, thus, is
conserved) was proved a decade ago, no study charted its complexity. Here, we
take a first step in this direction, by showing how to encode $\nu$PNs, a well
studied form of PN enriched with data, into conservative EOS (cEOS). This
yields a non-Primitive Recursive, $F_{\omega2}$ lower-bound on cEOS
coverability.


## AI 摘要

本文研究了保守基本对象系统（cEOS）的覆盖性问题复杂度。cEOS是一种令牌携带内部Petri网的扩展Petri网模型，其保守性要求内部网类型不能被完全删除。通过将带有数据的νPetri网（νPN）编码为cEOS，研究首次证明了cEOS覆盖性问题具有非原始递归复杂度，并给出了Fω2的下界。这一结果为理解cEOS的计算复杂性迈出了重要一步，补充了十年前已知的cEOS覆盖性可判定性结论，但此前未涉及其复杂度分析。该成果对多智能体系统鲁棒性分析具有重要意义。
