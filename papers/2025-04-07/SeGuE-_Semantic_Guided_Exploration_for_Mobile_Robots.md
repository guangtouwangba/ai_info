# SeGuE: Semantic Guided Exploration for Mobile Robots

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03629v1

## 原始摘要

The rise of embodied AI applications has enabled robots to perform complex
tasks which require a sophisticated understanding of their environment. To
enable successful robot operation in such settings, maps must be constructed so
that they include semantic information, in addition to geometric information.
In this paper, we address the novel problem of semantic exploration, whereby a
mobile robot must autonomously explore an environment to fully map both its
structure and the semantic appearance of features. We develop a method based on
next-best-view exploration, where potential poses are scored based on the
semantic features visible from that pose. We explore two alternative methods
for sampling potential views and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework
in both simulation and physical experiments. Automatic creation of high-quality
semantic maps can enable robots to better understand and interact with their
environments and enable future embodied AI applications to be more easily
deployed.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种用于机器人自主探索环境的语义探索新方法，旨在同时构建包含几何和语义信息的地图。该方法基于"最佳下一视角"策略，通过评估潜在视角下可见的语义特征来评分候选位姿。研究探索了两种不同的视角采样方法，并在仿真和物理实验中验证了框架的有效性。这种自动创建高质量语义地图的技术可帮助机器人更好地理解环境并进行交互，为未来具身AI应用的部署提供支持。
