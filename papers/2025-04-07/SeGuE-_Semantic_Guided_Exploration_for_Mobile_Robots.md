# SeGuE: Semantic Guided Exploration for Mobile Robots

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03629v1

## 原始摘要

The rise of embodied AI applications has enabled robots to perform complex
tasks which require a sophisticated understanding of their environment. To
enable successful robot operation in such settings, maps must be constructed so
that they include semantic information, in addition to geometric information.
In this paper, we address the novel problem of semantic exploration, whereby a
mobile robot must autonomously explore an environment to fully map both its
structure and the semantic appearance of features. We develop a method based on
next-best-view exploration, where potential poses are scored based on the
semantic features visible from that pose. We explore two alternative methods
for sampling potential views and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework
in both simulation and physical experiments. Automatic creation of high-quality
semantic maps can enable robots to better understand and interact with their
environments and enable future embodied AI applications to be more easily
deployed.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种新颖的语义探索方法，使移动机器人能自主探索环境并构建包含几何和语义信息的完整地图。该方法基于"最佳下一视点"策略，通过评估潜在视点可见的语义特征来评分。研究者探索了两种替代性的视点采样方法，并在仿真和物理实验中验证了框架的有效性。这种自动创建高质量语义地图的技术可帮助机器人更好地理解和与环境互动，为未来具身AI应用提供更便捷的部署方案。研究聚焦于同时获取环境结构和语义特征，推动了机器人环境理解能力的发展。
