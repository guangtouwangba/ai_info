# SeGuE: Semantic Guided Exploration for Mobile Robots

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03629v1

## 原始摘要

The rise of embodied AI applications has enabled robots to perform complex
tasks which require a sophisticated understanding of their environment. To
enable successful robot operation in such settings, maps must be constructed so
that they include semantic information, in addition to geometric information.
In this paper, we address the novel problem of semantic exploration, whereby a
mobile robot must autonomously explore an environment to fully map both its
structure and the semantic appearance of features. We develop a method based on
next-best-view exploration, where potential poses are scored based on the
semantic features visible from that pose. We explore two alternative methods
for sampling potential views and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework
in both simulation and physical experiments. Automatic creation of high-quality
semantic maps can enable robots to better understand and interact with their
environments and enable future embodied AI applications to be more easily
deployed.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种基于语义探索的机器人自主建图方法，使移动机器人能同时构建环境的结构和语义特征地图。该方法采用"最佳下一视点"策略，根据潜在视点可见的语义特征进行评分。研究者探索了两种不同的视点采样方法，并通过仿真和实物实验验证了框架的有效性。这种高质量语义地图的自动创建技术，可提升机器人对环境的理解和交互能力，为具身AI应用的实际部署提供支持。研究解决了在复杂任务中机器人需要同时获取几何和语义信息的关键问题。
