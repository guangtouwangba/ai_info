# SeGuE: Semantic Guided Exploration for Mobile Robots

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03629v1

## 原始摘要

The rise of embodied AI applications has enabled robots to perform complex
tasks which require a sophisticated understanding of their environment. To
enable successful robot operation in such settings, maps must be constructed so
that they include semantic information, in addition to geometric information.
In this paper, we address the novel problem of semantic exploration, whereby a
mobile robot must autonomously explore an environment to fully map both its
structure and the semantic appearance of features. We develop a method based on
next-best-view exploration, where potential poses are scored based on the
semantic features visible from that pose. We explore two alternative methods
for sampling potential views and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework
in both simulation and physical experiments. Automatic creation of high-quality
semantic maps can enable robots to better understand and interact with their
environments and enable future embodied AI applications to be more easily
deployed.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种基于语义探索的机器人自主建图方法，使移动机器人能够同时构建环境的结构和语义特征地图。该方法采用"最佳下一视角"策略，根据潜在视角下可见的语义特征对候选位姿进行评分，并探索了两种不同的视角采样方法。实验验证了该框架在仿真和实际场景中的有效性。这种高质量语义地图的自动创建有助于机器人更好地理解和与环境交互，推动具身AI应用的部署。
