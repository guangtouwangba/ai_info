# Autonomous and Self-Adapting System for Synthetic Media Detection and Attribution

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03615v1

## 原始摘要

Rapid advances in generative AI have enabled the creation of highly realistic
synthetic images, which, while beneficial in many domains, also pose serious
risks in terms of disinformation, fraud, and other malicious applications.
Current synthetic image identification systems are typically static, relying on
feature representations learned from known generators; as new generative models
emerge, these systems suffer from severe performance degradation. In this
paper, we introduce the concept of an autonomous self-adaptive synthetic media
identification system -- one that not only detects synthetic images and
attributes them to known sources but also autonomously identifies and
incorporates novel generators without human intervention. Our approach
leverages an open-set identification strategy with an evolvable embedding space
that distinguishes between known and unknown sources. By employing an
unsupervised clustering method to aggregate unknown samples into
high-confidence clusters and continuously refining its decision boundaries, our
system maintains robust detection and attribution performance even as the
generative landscape evolves. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing approaches, marking a crucial step toward
universal, adaptable forensic systems in the era of rapidly advancing
generative models.
