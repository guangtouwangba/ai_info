# Autonomous and Self-Adapting System for Synthetic Media Detection and Attribution

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03615v1

## 原始摘要

Rapid advances in generative AI have enabled the creation of highly realistic
synthetic images, which, while beneficial in many domains, also pose serious
risks in terms of disinformation, fraud, and other malicious applications.
Current synthetic image identification systems are typically static, relying on
feature representations learned from known generators; as new generative models
emerge, these systems suffer from severe performance degradation. In this
paper, we introduce the concept of an autonomous self-adaptive synthetic media
identification system -- one that not only detects synthetic images and
attributes them to known sources but also autonomously identifies and
incorporates novel generators without human intervention. Our approach
leverages an open-set identification strategy with an evolvable embedding space
that distinguishes between known and unknown sources. By employing an
unsupervised clustering method to aggregate unknown samples into
high-confidence clusters and continuously refining its decision boundaries, our
system maintains robust detection and attribution performance even as the
generative landscape evolves. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing approaches, marking a crucial step toward
universal, adaptable forensic systems in the era of rapidly advancing
generative models.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文提出了一种自主自适应的合成图像识别系统，能够检测合成图像并识别其来源，同时还能自主发现并整合新型生成器，无需人工干预。该系统采用开放集识别策略和可演化的嵌入空间，区分已知和未知来源。通过无监督聚类将未知样本聚集成高置信度簇，并持续优化决策边界，即使在生成模型不断更新的情况下，仍能保持强大的检测和溯源性能。实验表明，该方法显著优于现有技术，为快速发展的生成模型时代提供了通用、适应性强的取证系统解决方案。
