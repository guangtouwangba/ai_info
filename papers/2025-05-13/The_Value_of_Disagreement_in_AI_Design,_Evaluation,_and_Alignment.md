# The Value of Disagreement in AI Design, Evaluation, and Alignment

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07772v1

## 原始摘要

Disagreements are widespread across the design, evaluation, and alignment
pipelines of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Yet, standard practices in
AI development often obscure or eliminate disagreement, resulting in an
engineered homogenization that can be epistemically and ethically harmful,
particularly for marginalized groups. In this paper, we characterize this risk,
and develop a normative framework to guide practical reasoning about
disagreement in the AI lifecycle. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we
introduce the notion of perspectival homogenization, characterizing it as a
coupled ethical-epistemic risk that arises when an aspect of an AI system's
development unjustifiably suppresses disagreement and diversity of
perspectives. We argue that perspectival homogenization is best understood as a
procedural risk, which calls for targeted interventions throughout the AI
development pipeline. Second, we propose a normative framework to guide such
interventions, grounded in lines of research that explain why disagreement can
be epistemically beneficial, and how its benefits can be realized in practice.
We apply this framework to key design questions across three stages of AI
development tasks: when disagreement is epistemically valuable; whose
perspectives should be included and preserved; how to structure tasks and
navigate trade-offs; and how disagreement should be documented and
communicated. In doing so, we challenge common assumptions in AI practice,
offer a principled foundation for emerging participatory and pluralistic
approaches, and identify actionable pathways for future work in AI design and
governance.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文探讨了人工智能（AI）开发中忽视或压制不同观点的风险，提出了“视角同质化”的概念，即AI系统开发过程中不合理地压制分歧和多样性视角，可能对边缘群体造成伦理和认知上的危害。作者提出了一个规范性框架，强调分歧在AI生命周期中的认知价值，并指导如何纳入多元视角、权衡取舍以及记录分歧。该框架挑战了AI实践中的常见假设，为新兴的参与式和多元化方法提供了理论基础，并为未来AI设计和治理提供了可操作的路径。
