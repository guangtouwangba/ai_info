# The Value of Disagreement in AI Design, Evaluation, and Alignment

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07772v1

## 原始摘要

Disagreements are widespread across the design, evaluation, and alignment
pipelines of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Yet, standard practices in
AI development often obscure or eliminate disagreement, resulting in an
engineered homogenization that can be epistemically and ethically harmful,
particularly for marginalized groups. In this paper, we characterize this risk,
and develop a normative framework to guide practical reasoning about
disagreement in the AI lifecycle. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we
introduce the notion of perspectival homogenization, characterizing it as a
coupled ethical-epistemic risk that arises when an aspect of an AI system's
development unjustifiably suppresses disagreement and diversity of
perspectives. We argue that perspectival homogenization is best understood as a
procedural risk, which calls for targeted interventions throughout the AI
development pipeline. Second, we propose a normative framework to guide such
interventions, grounded in lines of research that explain why disagreement can
be epistemically beneficial, and how its benefits can be realized in practice.
We apply this framework to key design questions across three stages of AI
development tasks: when disagreement is epistemically valuable; whose
perspectives should be included and preserved; how to structure tasks and
navigate trade-offs; and how disagreement should be documented and
communicated. In doing so, we challenge common assumptions in AI practice,
offer a principled foundation for emerging participatory and pluralistic
approaches, and identify actionable pathways for future work in AI design and
governance.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文探讨了人工智能（AI）开发中因压制分歧导致的“视角同质化”风险，认为这种同质化可能损害认知多样性和边缘群体的利益。作者提出将分歧视为一种耦合的伦理-认知风险，并构建了一个规范性框架，指导在AI生命周期中合理处理分歧。该框架强调分歧的认知价值、多元视角的纳入、任务设计与权衡管理，以及分歧的记录与沟通。研究挑战了AI实践中的常见假设，为参与式和多元化方法提供了理论基础，并提出了未来AI设计与治理的可操作路径。
