# The Value of Disagreement in AI Design, Evaluation, and Alignment

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07772v1

## 原始摘要

Disagreements are widespread across the design, evaluation, and alignment
pipelines of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Yet, standard practices in
AI development often obscure or eliminate disagreement, resulting in an
engineered homogenization that can be epistemically and ethically harmful,
particularly for marginalized groups. In this paper, we characterize this risk,
and develop a normative framework to guide practical reasoning about
disagreement in the AI lifecycle. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we
introduce the notion of perspectival homogenization, characterizing it as a
coupled ethical-epistemic risk that arises when an aspect of an AI system's
development unjustifiably suppresses disagreement and diversity of
perspectives. We argue that perspectival homogenization is best understood as a
procedural risk, which calls for targeted interventions throughout the AI
development pipeline. Second, we propose a normative framework to guide such
interventions, grounded in lines of research that explain why disagreement can
be epistemically beneficial, and how its benefits can be realized in practice.
We apply this framework to key design questions across three stages of AI
development tasks: when disagreement is epistemically valuable; whose
perspectives should be included and preserved; how to structure tasks and
navigate trade-offs; and how disagreement should be documented and
communicated. In doing so, we challenge common assumptions in AI practice,
offer a principled foundation for emerging participatory and pluralistic
approaches, and identify actionable pathways for future work in AI design and
governance.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文探讨了人工智能（AI）系统开发中忽视分歧的风险，并提出了一种规范框架来指导实践。作者提出“视角同质化”概念，指出压制分歧和多样性会导致伦理与认知风险，尤其对边缘群体有害。论文主张将分歧视为认知资源，并提出了干预框架，强调在AI开发各阶段纳入多元视角，包括何时重视分歧、纳入谁的视角、如何权衡以及如何记录分歧。该研究挑战了AI实践中的常见假设，为参与式和多元化方法提供了理论基础，并为未来AI设计与治理提出了可行路径。
