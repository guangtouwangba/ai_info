# MLE-Dojo: Interactive Environments for Empowering LLM Agents in Machine Learning Engineering

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07782v1

## 原始摘要

We introduce MLE-Dojo, a Gym-style framework for systematically reinforcement
learning, evaluating, and improving autonomous large language model (LLM)
agents in iterative machine learning engineering (MLE) workflows. Unlike
existing benchmarks that primarily rely on static datasets or single-attempt
evaluations, MLE-Dojo provides an interactive environment enabling agents to
iteratively experiment, debug, and refine solutions through structured feedback
loops. Built upon 200+ real-world Kaggle challenges, MLE-Dojo covers diverse,
open-ended MLE tasks carefully curated to reflect realistic engineering
scenarios such as data processing, architecture search, hyperparameter tuning,
and code debugging. Its fully executable environment supports comprehensive
agent training via both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning,
facilitating iterative experimentation, realistic data sampling, and real-time
outcome verification. Extensive evaluations of eight frontier LLMs reveal that
while current models achieve meaningful iterative improvements, they still
exhibit significant limitations in autonomously generating long-horizon
solutions and efficiently resolving complex errors. Furthermore, MLE-Dojo's
flexible and extensible architecture seamlessly integrates diverse data
sources, tools, and evaluation protocols, uniquely enabling model-based agent
tuning and promoting interoperability, scalability, and reproducibility. We
open-source our framework and benchmarks to foster community-driven innovation
towards next-generation MLE agents.


## AI 摘要

MLE-Dojo是一个Gym风格的强化学习框架，用于系统训练、评估和改进基于大语言模型（LLM）的自主智能体。该框架基于200多个真实Kaggle挑战，涵盖数据处理、架构搜索、超参数调优等机器学习工程任务，提供交互式环境和结构化反馈循环，支持监督微调和强化学习。评估显示当前LLM在迭代改进方面有效，但在生成长期解决方案和解决复杂错误方面仍有局限。MLE-Dojo具有灵活可扩展的架构，支持多样化数据源、工具和评估协议，促进模型调优和可复现性。该框架已开源以推动社区创新。
