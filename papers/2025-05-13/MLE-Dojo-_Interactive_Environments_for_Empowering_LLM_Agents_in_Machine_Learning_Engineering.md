# MLE-Dojo: Interactive Environments for Empowering LLM Agents in Machine Learning Engineering

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07782v1

## 原始摘要

We introduce MLE-Dojo, a Gym-style framework for systematically reinforcement
learning, evaluating, and improving autonomous large language model (LLM)
agents in iterative machine learning engineering (MLE) workflows. Unlike
existing benchmarks that primarily rely on static datasets or single-attempt
evaluations, MLE-Dojo provides an interactive environment enabling agents to
iteratively experiment, debug, and refine solutions through structured feedback
loops. Built upon 200+ real-world Kaggle challenges, MLE-Dojo covers diverse,
open-ended MLE tasks carefully curated to reflect realistic engineering
scenarios such as data processing, architecture search, hyperparameter tuning,
and code debugging. Its fully executable environment supports comprehensive
agent training via both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning,
facilitating iterative experimentation, realistic data sampling, and real-time
outcome verification. Extensive evaluations of eight frontier LLMs reveal that
while current models achieve meaningful iterative improvements, they still
exhibit significant limitations in autonomously generating long-horizon
solutions and efficiently resolving complex errors. Furthermore, MLE-Dojo's
flexible and extensible architecture seamlessly integrates diverse data
sources, tools, and evaluation protocols, uniquely enabling model-based agent
tuning and promoting interoperability, scalability, and reproducibility. We
open-source our framework and benchmarks to foster community-driven innovation
towards next-generation MLE agents.


## AI 摘要

MLE-Dojo是一个Gym风格的强化学习框架，用于在迭代式机器学习工程(MLE)流程中训练、评估和改进基于大语言模型(LLM)的自主智能体。该框架基于200多个真实Kaggle挑战构建，涵盖数据处理、架构搜索、超参数调优等多样化MLE任务，支持监督微调和强化学习。与依赖静态数据的基准不同，MLE-Dojo提供交互式环境，允许智能体通过反馈循环迭代优化解决方案。评估显示当前LLM在长程解决方案生成和复杂错误处理方面仍有局限。该开源框架支持灵活扩展，促进下一代MLE智能体的研发。
