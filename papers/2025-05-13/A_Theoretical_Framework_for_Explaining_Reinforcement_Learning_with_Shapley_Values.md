# A Theoretical Framework for Explaining Reinforcement Learning with Shapley Values

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07797v1

## 原始摘要

Reinforcement learning agents can achieve superhuman performance, but their
decisions are often difficult to interpret. This lack of transparency limits
deployment, especially in safety-critical settings where human trust and
accountability are essential. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework
for explaining reinforcement learning through the influence of state features,
which represent what the agent observes in its environment. We identify three
core elements of the agent-environment interaction that benefit from
explanation: behaviour (what the agent does), performance (what the agent
achieves), and value estimation (what the agent expects to achieve). We treat
state features as players cooperating to produce each element and apply Shapley
values, a principled method from cooperative game theory, to identify the
influence of each feature. This approach yields a family of mathematically
grounded explanations with clear semantics and theoretical guarantees. We use
illustrative examples to show how these explanations align with human intuition
and reveal novel insights. Our framework unifies and extends prior work, making
explicit the assumptions behind existing approaches, and offers a principled
foundation for more interpretable and trustworthy reinforcement learning.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文提出了一个理论框架，通过分析智能体观察的环境状态特征来解释强化学习决策。研究聚焦三个核心交互元素：行为（智能体的动作）、表现（智能体的成就）和价值估计（智能体的预期）。该方法将状态特征视为合作玩家，运用博弈论中的Shapley值量化每个特征的影响力，从而提供数学严谨、语义明确的解释。示例显示该方法符合人类直觉并能揭示新见解。该框架统一并扩展了现有工作，明确了各种方法的假设前提，为构建更可解释、更可信的强化学习系统奠定了理论基础。
