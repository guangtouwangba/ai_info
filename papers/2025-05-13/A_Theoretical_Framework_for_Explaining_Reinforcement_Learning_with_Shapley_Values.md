# A Theoretical Framework for Explaining Reinforcement Learning with Shapley Values

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07797v1

## 原始摘要

Reinforcement learning agents can achieve superhuman performance, but their
decisions are often difficult to interpret. This lack of transparency limits
deployment, especially in safety-critical settings where human trust and
accountability are essential. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework
for explaining reinforcement learning through the influence of state features,
which represent what the agent observes in its environment. We identify three
core elements of the agent-environment interaction that benefit from
explanation: behaviour (what the agent does), performance (what the agent
achieves), and value estimation (what the agent expects to achieve). We treat
state features as players cooperating to produce each element and apply Shapley
values, a principled method from cooperative game theory, to identify the
influence of each feature. This approach yields a family of mathematically
grounded explanations with clear semantics and theoretical guarantees. We use
illustrative examples to show how these explanations align with human intuition
and reveal novel insights. Our framework unifies and extends prior work, making
explicit the assumptions behind existing approaches, and offers a principled
foundation for more interpretable and trustworthy reinforcement learning.


## AI 摘要

该研究提出了一种基于状态特征影响力的强化学习解释理论框架，旨在解决智能体决策缺乏透明度的问题。通过将状态特征视为合作产生行为、性能和价值估计三个核心交互元素的参与者，并应用合作博弈论中的Shapley值来量化每个特征的影响力，该方法提供了一组具有明确语义和理论保证的数学解释。研究展示了这些解释如何符合人类直觉并揭示新见解，统一并扩展了现有工作，为构建更可解释和可信赖的强化学习系统奠定了理论基础。
