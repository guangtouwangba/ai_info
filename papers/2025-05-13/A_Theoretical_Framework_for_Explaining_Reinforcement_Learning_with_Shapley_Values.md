# A Theoretical Framework for Explaining Reinforcement Learning with Shapley Values

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07797v1

## 原始摘要

Reinforcement learning agents can achieve superhuman performance, but their
decisions are often difficult to interpret. This lack of transparency limits
deployment, especially in safety-critical settings where human trust and
accountability are essential. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework
for explaining reinforcement learning through the influence of state features,
which represent what the agent observes in its environment. We identify three
core elements of the agent-environment interaction that benefit from
explanation: behaviour (what the agent does), performance (what the agent
achieves), and value estimation (what the agent expects to achieve). We treat
state features as players cooperating to produce each element and apply Shapley
values, a principled method from cooperative game theory, to identify the
influence of each feature. This approach yields a family of mathematically
grounded explanations with clear semantics and theoretical guarantees. We use
illustrative examples to show how these explanations align with human intuition
and reveal novel insights. Our framework unifies and extends prior work, making
explicit the assumptions behind existing approaches, and offers a principled
foundation for more interpretable and trustworthy reinforcement learning.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一个基于状态特征影响的强化学习解释理论框架，旨在解决智能体决策缺乏透明度的问题。该框架聚焦三个核心交互要素：行为（做什么）、性能（达成什么）和价值估计（预期达成什么）。通过将状态特征视为合作参与者，并应用博弈论中的Shapley值方法量化各特征影响力，构建了具有明确语义和理论保证的数学解释体系。研究统一并扩展了现有工作，揭示了传统方法的隐含假设，为建立更可解释、可信赖的强化学习系统奠定了理论基础。案例研究表明，该方法能产生符合人类直觉且具有新洞察力的解释。
