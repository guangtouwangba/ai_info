# Must Read: A Systematic Survey of Computational Persuasion

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07775v1

## 原始摘要

Persuasion is a fundamental aspect of communication, influencing
decision-making across diverse contexts, from everyday conversations to
high-stakes scenarios such as politics, marketing, and law. The rise of
conversational AI systems has significantly expanded the scope of persuasion,
introducing both opportunities and risks. AI-driven persuasion can be leveraged
for beneficial applications, but also poses threats through manipulation and
unethical influence. Moreover, AI systems are not only persuaders, but also
susceptible to persuasion, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks and
bias reinforcement. Despite rapid advancements in AI-generated persuasive
content, our understanding of what makes persuasion effective remains limited
due to its inherently subjective and context-dependent nature. In this survey,
we provide a comprehensive overview of computational persuasion, structured
around three key perspectives: (1) AI as a Persuader, which explores
AI-generated persuasive content and its applications; (2) AI as a Persuadee,
which examines AI's susceptibility to influence and manipulation; and (3) AI as
a Persuasion Judge, which analyzes AI's role in evaluating persuasive
strategies, detecting manipulation, and ensuring ethical persuasion. We
introduce a taxonomy for computational persuasion research and discuss key
challenges, including evaluating persuasiveness, mitigating manipulative
persuasion, and developing responsible AI-driven persuasive systems. Our survey
outlines future research directions to enhance the safety, fairness, and
effectiveness of AI-powered persuasion while addressing the risks posed by
increasingly capable language models.


## AI 摘要

这篇摘要探讨了人工智能在说服领域的多重角色和应用。AI既可作为说服者生成有影响力的内容（如营销、政治等），也可能被操纵成为被说服者，还可用作评估说服策略的裁判。研究指出AI驱动的说服既带来机遇（如有益应用），也存在风险（如操纵和偏见强化）。由于说服具有主观性和情境依赖性，评估其有效性仍具挑战。文章提出了计算说服研究的分类框架，并讨论了关键挑战：评估说服力、减少操纵性说服、开发负责任的AI说服系统。未来研究需关注提升AI说服的安全性、公平性和有效性，同时应对强大语言模型带来的风险。
