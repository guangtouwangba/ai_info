# Must Read: A Systematic Survey of Computational Persuasion

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07775v1

## 原始摘要

Persuasion is a fundamental aspect of communication, influencing
decision-making across diverse contexts, from everyday conversations to
high-stakes scenarios such as politics, marketing, and law. The rise of
conversational AI systems has significantly expanded the scope of persuasion,
introducing both opportunities and risks. AI-driven persuasion can be leveraged
for beneficial applications, but also poses threats through manipulation and
unethical influence. Moreover, AI systems are not only persuaders, but also
susceptible to persuasion, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks and
bias reinforcement. Despite rapid advancements in AI-generated persuasive
content, our understanding of what makes persuasion effective remains limited
due to its inherently subjective and context-dependent nature. In this survey,
we provide a comprehensive overview of computational persuasion, structured
around three key perspectives: (1) AI as a Persuader, which explores
AI-generated persuasive content and its applications; (2) AI as a Persuadee,
which examines AI's susceptibility to influence and manipulation; and (3) AI as
a Persuasion Judge, which analyzes AI's role in evaluating persuasive
strategies, detecting manipulation, and ensuring ethical persuasion. We
introduce a taxonomy for computational persuasion research and discuss key
challenges, including evaluating persuasiveness, mitigating manipulative
persuasion, and developing responsible AI-driven persuasive systems. Our survey
outlines future research directions to enhance the safety, fairness, and
effectiveness of AI-powered persuasion while addressing the risks posed by
increasingly capable language models.


## AI 摘要

这篇摘要探讨了AI在说服领域的多重角色与挑战。说服是沟通的核心要素，而AI的兴起既带来了机遇（如有益应用），也引发了风险（如操纵和不道德影响）。研究从三个视角分析：1）AI作为说服者，生成说服性内容；2）AI作为被说服者，易受攻击和偏见影响；3）AI作为评判者，评估说服策略并检测操纵行为。文章提出了计算说服研究的分类框架，并指出关键挑战：评估说服效果、防止操纵性说服及开发负责任的AI说服系统。未来需研究如何提升AI说服的安全性、公平性和有效性，同时应对强大语言模型的风险。
