# TRUST: An LLM-Based Dialogue System for Trauma Understanding and Structured Assessments

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21851v1

## 原始摘要

Objectives: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely used to
assist clinicians and support patients, no existing work has explored dialogue
systems for standard diagnostic interviews and assessments. This study aims to
bridge the gap in mental healthcare accessibility by developing an LLM-powered
dialogue system that replicates clinician behavior. Materials and Methods: We
introduce TRUST, a framework of cooperative LLM modules capable of conducting
formal diagnostic interviews and assessments for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
(PTSD). To guide the generation of appropriate clinical responses, we propose a
Dialogue Acts schema specifically designed for clinical interviews.
Additionally, we develop a patient simulation approach based on real-life
interview transcripts to replace time-consuming and costly manual testing by
clinicians. Results: A comprehensive set of evaluation metrics is designed to
assess the dialogue system from both the agent and patient simulation
perspectives. Expert evaluations by conversation and clinical specialists show
that TRUST performs comparably to real-life clinical interviews. Discussion:
Our system performs at the level of average clinicians, with room for future
enhancements in communication styles and response appropriateness. Conclusions:
Our TRUST framework shows its potential to facilitate mental healthcare
availability.


## AI 摘要

本研究开发了TRUST框架，一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的对话系统，用于创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）的标准诊断访谈和评估。该框架采用协作式LLM模块，结合专为临床访谈设计的对话行为模式，能模拟临床医生行为。通过基于真实访谈记录的病人模拟方法进行测试，避免了耗时的人工评估。专家评审表明，TRUST的表现与真实临床访谈相当，达到普通医生水平，未来可在沟通方式和应答适切性方面改进。该框架展现了提升心理健康服务可及性的潜力。
