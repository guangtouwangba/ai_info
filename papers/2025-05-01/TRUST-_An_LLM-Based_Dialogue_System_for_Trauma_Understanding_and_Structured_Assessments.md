# TRUST: An LLM-Based Dialogue System for Trauma Understanding and Structured Assessments

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21851v1

## 原始摘要

Objectives: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely used to
assist clinicians and support patients, no existing work has explored dialogue
systems for standard diagnostic interviews and assessments. This study aims to
bridge the gap in mental healthcare accessibility by developing an LLM-powered
dialogue system that replicates clinician behavior. Materials and Methods: We
introduce TRUST, a framework of cooperative LLM modules capable of conducting
formal diagnostic interviews and assessments for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
(PTSD). To guide the generation of appropriate clinical responses, we propose a
Dialogue Acts schema specifically designed for clinical interviews.
Additionally, we develop a patient simulation approach based on real-life
interview transcripts to replace time-consuming and costly manual testing by
clinicians. Results: A comprehensive set of evaluation metrics is designed to
assess the dialogue system from both the agent and patient simulation
perspectives. Expert evaluations by conversation and clinical specialists show
that TRUST performs comparably to real-life clinical interviews. Discussion:
Our system performs at the level of average clinicians, with room for future
enhancements in communication styles and response appropriateness. Conclusions:
Our TRUST framework shows its potential to facilitate mental healthcare
availability.


## AI 摘要

本研究开发了TRUST框架，一个基于大语言模型（LLM）的对话系统，用于创伤后应激障碍（PTSD）的标准诊断访谈和评估。该框架包含协作式LLM模块，采用专门设计的临床对话行为模式生成适当回应，并通过基于真实访谈记录的模拟患者方法进行测试。评估显示，TRUST在专家评审中表现与真实临床访谈相当，达到普通临床医生水平，未来可在沟通风格和回应适切性方面改进。该研究为提升心理健康服务的可及性提供了新途径。
