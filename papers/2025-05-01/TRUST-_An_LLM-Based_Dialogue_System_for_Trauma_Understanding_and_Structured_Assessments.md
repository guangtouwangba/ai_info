# TRUST: An LLM-Based Dialogue System for Trauma Understanding and Structured Assessments

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21851v1

## 原始摘要

Objectives: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely used to
assist clinicians and support patients, no existing work has explored dialogue
systems for standard diagnostic interviews and assessments. This study aims to
bridge the gap in mental healthcare accessibility by developing an LLM-powered
dialogue system that replicates clinician behavior. Materials and Methods: We
introduce TRUST, a framework of cooperative LLM modules capable of conducting
formal diagnostic interviews and assessments for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
(PTSD). To guide the generation of appropriate clinical responses, we propose a
Dialogue Acts schema specifically designed for clinical interviews.
Additionally, we develop a patient simulation approach based on real-life
interview transcripts to replace time-consuming and costly manual testing by
clinicians. Results: A comprehensive set of evaluation metrics is designed to
assess the dialogue system from both the agent and patient simulation
perspectives. Expert evaluations by conversation and clinical specialists show
that TRUST performs comparably to real-life clinical interviews. Discussion:
Our system performs at the level of average clinicians, with room for future
enhancements in communication styles and response appropriateness. Conclusions:
Our TRUST framework shows its potential to facilitate mental healthcare
availability.


## AI 摘要

本研究开发了名为TRUST的LLM对话系统框架，用于标准化创伤后应激障碍(PTSD)诊断访谈。该系统采用协作式模块设计，结合专为临床访谈设计的对话行为模式，能模拟医生行为进行诊断评估。通过基于真实访谈记录的病人模拟方法替代人工测试，并设计了多维度评估指标。专家评估表明，TRUST的表现接近真实临床访谈水平，达到普通医生水准，但在沟通方式和应答适切性方面仍有提升空间。该框架展现了提升心理健康服务可及性的潜力，为标准化诊断访谈的自动化提供了新思路。
