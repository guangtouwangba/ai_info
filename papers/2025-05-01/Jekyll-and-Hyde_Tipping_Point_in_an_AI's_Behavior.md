# Jekyll-and-Hyde Tipping Point in an AI's Behavior

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20980v1

## 原始摘要

Trust in AI is undermined by the fact that there is no science that predicts
-- or that can explain to the public -- when an LLM's output (e.g. ChatGPT) is
likely to tip mid-response to become wrong, misleading, irrelevant or
dangerous. With deaths and trauma already being blamed on LLMs, this
uncertainty is even pushing people to treat their 'pet' LLM more politely to
'dissuade' it (or its future Artificial General Intelligence offspring) from
suddenly turning on them. Here we address this acute need by deriving from
first principles an exact formula for when a Jekyll-and-Hyde tipping point
occurs at LLMs' most basic level. Requiring only secondary school mathematics,
it shows the cause to be the AI's attention spreading so thin it suddenly
snaps. This exact formula provides quantitative predictions for how the
tipping-point can be delayed or prevented by changing the prompt and the AI's
training. Tailored generalizations will provide policymakers and the public
with a firm platform for discussing any of AI's broader uses and risks, e.g. as
a personal counselor, medical advisor, decision-maker for when to use force in
a conflict situation. It also meets the need for clear and transparent answers
to questions like ''should I be polite to my LLM?''


## AI 摘要

该研究针对公众对AI（如ChatGPT）输出突然变得错误、误导或危险的担忧，提出了一个基于基本原理的精确公式，用于预测LLM（大语言模型）的"杰基尔与海德"临界点。公式显示，临界点源于AI注意力过度分散导致的突然崩溃，仅需中学数学即可理解。该公式量化了如何通过调整提示词和训练来延迟或防止临界点，为政策制定者和公众讨论AI风险（如医疗建议、决策等）提供了科学依据，并解答了"是否应对LLM保持礼貌"等实际问题，增强了AI使用的透明度和信任。
