# Characterizing AI Agents for Alignment and Governance

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21848v1

## 原始摘要

The creation of effective governance mechanisms for AI agents requires a
deeper understanding of their core properties and how these properties relate
to questions surrounding the deployment and operation of agents in the world.
This paper provides a characterization of AI agents that focuses on four
dimensions: autonomy, efficacy, goal complexity, and generality. We propose
different gradations for each dimension, and argue that each dimension raises
unique questions about the design, operation, and governance of these systems.
Moreover, we draw upon this framework to construct "agentic profiles" for
different kinds of AI agents. These profiles help to illuminate cross-cutting
technical and non-technical governance challenges posed by different classes of
AI agents, ranging from narrow task-specific assistants to highly autonomous
general-purpose systems. By mapping out key axes of variation and continuity,
this framework provides developers, policymakers, and members of the public
with the opportunity to develop governance approaches that better align with
collective societal goals.


## AI 摘要

该论文提出了一个AI智能体的四维分析框架：自主性、效能性、目标复杂性和通用性，并针对每个维度划分了不同等级。通过构建"智能体特征图谱"，该框架揭示了从单一任务助手到高度自主的通用系统等不同类别AI智能体带来的跨领域技术与非技术治理挑战。这一分类方法为开发者、政策制定者和公众提供了系统性工具，有助于根据智能体的具体特性制定更符合社会共同目标的治理策略。研究强调，理解AI核心属性是建立有效治理机制的关键基础。
