# Characterizing AI Agents for Alignment and Governance

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21848v1

## 原始摘要

The creation of effective governance mechanisms for AI agents requires a
deeper understanding of their core properties and how these properties relate
to questions surrounding the deployment and operation of agents in the world.
This paper provides a characterization of AI agents that focuses on four
dimensions: autonomy, efficacy, goal complexity, and generality. We propose
different gradations for each dimension, and argue that each dimension raises
unique questions about the design, operation, and governance of these systems.
Moreover, we draw upon this framework to construct "agentic profiles" for
different kinds of AI agents. These profiles help to illuminate cross-cutting
technical and non-technical governance challenges posed by different classes of
AI agents, ranging from narrow task-specific assistants to highly autonomous
general-purpose systems. By mapping out key axes of variation and continuity,
this framework provides developers, policymakers, and members of the public
with the opportunity to develop governance approaches that better align with
collective societal goals.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文提出了一个AI智能体的四维评估框架：自主性、效能、目标复杂性和通用性，并为每个维度划分了不同等级。通过构建"智能体特征图谱"，该框架能帮助分析从专用助手到通用系统的各类AI系统带来的跨领域治理挑战。研究旨在为开发者、政策制定者和公众提供工具，以开发更符合社会集体目标的治理方案。该框架通过明确AI核心特性和治理问题的关联，为建立有效的AI治理机制提供了理论基础。
