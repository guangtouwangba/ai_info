# Characterizing AI Agents for Alignment and Governance

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21848v1

## 原始摘要

The creation of effective governance mechanisms for AI agents requires a
deeper understanding of their core properties and how these properties relate
to questions surrounding the deployment and operation of agents in the world.
This paper provides a characterization of AI agents that focuses on four
dimensions: autonomy, efficacy, goal complexity, and generality. We propose
different gradations for each dimension, and argue that each dimension raises
unique questions about the design, operation, and governance of these systems.
Moreover, we draw upon this framework to construct "agentic profiles" for
different kinds of AI agents. These profiles help to illuminate cross-cutting
technical and non-technical governance challenges posed by different classes of
AI agents, ranging from narrow task-specific assistants to highly autonomous
general-purpose systems. By mapping out key axes of variation and continuity,
this framework provides developers, policymakers, and members of the public
with the opportunity to develop governance approaches that better align with
collective societal goals.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文提出了一个AI智能体的四维框架（自主性、效能、目标复杂性、通用性），并设计了每个维度的分级标准。通过构建不同AI智能体的"代理特征图谱"，该框架揭示了从专用助手到通用系统的各类AI系统带来的跨领域治理挑战。这种结构化分析为开发者、政策制定者和公众提供了评估AI治理的新工具，有助于制定更符合社会集体目标的监管策略。研究强调，理解智能体的核心特性是建立有效治理机制的基础，不同维度的特性会引发独特的设计、运营和治理问题。
