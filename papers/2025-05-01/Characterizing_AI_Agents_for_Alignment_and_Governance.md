# Characterizing AI Agents for Alignment and Governance

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21848v1

## 原始摘要

The creation of effective governance mechanisms for AI agents requires a
deeper understanding of their core properties and how these properties relate
to questions surrounding the deployment and operation of agents in the world.
This paper provides a characterization of AI agents that focuses on four
dimensions: autonomy, efficacy, goal complexity, and generality. We propose
different gradations for each dimension, and argue that each dimension raises
unique questions about the design, operation, and governance of these systems.
Moreover, we draw upon this framework to construct "agentic profiles" for
different kinds of AI agents. These profiles help to illuminate cross-cutting
technical and non-technical governance challenges posed by different classes of
AI agents, ranging from narrow task-specific assistants to highly autonomous
general-purpose systems. By mapping out key axes of variation and continuity,
this framework provides developers, policymakers, and members of the public
with the opportunity to develop governance approaches that better align with
collective societal goals.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文提出了一个AI智能体的四维分析框架：自主性、效能、目标复杂性和通用性。每个维度都有不同等级，并引发独特的设计、运营和治理问题。作者利用该框架构建了不同AI智能体的"代理特征档案"，从单一任务助手到高度自主的通用系统，揭示了各类AI带来的跨领域技术与非技术治理挑战。该框架通过梳理关键变量与连续性，为开发者、政策制定者和公众提供了开发更符合社会集体目标的治理方法的机会。研究强调了对AI核心特性的深入理解对建立有效治理机制的重要性。
