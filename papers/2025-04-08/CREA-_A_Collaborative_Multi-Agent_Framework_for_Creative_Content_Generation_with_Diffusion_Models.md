# CREA: A Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework for Creative Content Generation with Diffusion Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05306v1

## 原始摘要

Creativity in AI imagery remains a fundamental challenge, requiring not only
the generation of visually compelling content but also the capacity to add
novel, expressive, and artistically rich transformations to images. Unlike
conventional editing tasks that rely on direct prompt-based modifications,
creative image editing demands an autonomous, iterative approach that balances
originality, coherence, and artistic intent. To address this, we introduce
CREA, a novel multi-agent collaborative framework that mimics the human
creative process. Our framework leverages a team of specialized AI agents who
dynamically collaborate to conceptualize, generate, critique, and enhance
images. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we
demonstrate that CREA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
diversity, semantic alignment, and creative transformation. By structuring
creativity as a dynamic, agentic process, CREA redefines the intersection of AI
and art, paving the way for autonomous AI-driven artistic exploration,
generative design, and human-AI co-creation. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work to introduce the task of creative editing.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了CREA框架，旨在解决AI图像创作的创造性挑战。与依赖直接提示修改的传统编辑不同，CREA采用多智能体协作机制模拟人类创作流程，通过专业AI代理的协同工作实现概念化、生成、评估和增强的迭代过程。实验表明，CREA在多样性、语义对齐和创意转化方面显著优于现有方法。该框架将创造力构建为动态的智能体交互过程，重新定义了AI与艺术的结合，为自主艺术探索、生成设计和人机共创开辟了新途径。据作者所知，这是首个系统性研究创造性图像编辑任务的工作。
