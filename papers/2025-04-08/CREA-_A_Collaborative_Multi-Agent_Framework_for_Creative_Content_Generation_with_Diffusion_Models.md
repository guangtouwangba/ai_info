# CREA: A Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework for Creative Content Generation with Diffusion Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05306v1

## 原始摘要

Creativity in AI imagery remains a fundamental challenge, requiring not only
the generation of visually compelling content but also the capacity to add
novel, expressive, and artistically rich transformations to images. Unlike
conventional editing tasks that rely on direct prompt-based modifications,
creative image editing demands an autonomous, iterative approach that balances
originality, coherence, and artistic intent. To address this, we introduce
CREA, a novel multi-agent collaborative framework that mimics the human
creative process. Our framework leverages a team of specialized AI agents who
dynamically collaborate to conceptualize, generate, critique, and enhance
images. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we
demonstrate that CREA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
diversity, semantic alignment, and creative transformation. By structuring
creativity as a dynamic, agentic process, CREA redefines the intersection of AI
and art, paving the way for autonomous AI-driven artistic exploration,
generative design, and human-AI co-creation. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work to introduce the task of creative editing.


## AI 摘要

研究人员提出了一种名为CREA的新型多智能体协作框架，旨在解决AI图像创作的创造性挑战。与传统的基于提示的直接修改不同，CREA通过模拟人类创作过程，让多个专业AI智能体动态协作，完成构思、生成、评价和增强图像的完整流程。实验表明，CREA在多样性、语义对齐和创意转换方面显著优于现有方法。该框架将创造力构建为动态的智能体交互过程，重新定义了AI与艺术的结合，为自主AI艺术探索、生成设计和人机协同创作开辟了新途径。这是首个专注于创造性图像编辑任务的研究工作。
