# CREA: A Collaborative Multi-Agent Framework for Creative Content Generation with Diffusion Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05306v1

## 原始摘要

Creativity in AI imagery remains a fundamental challenge, requiring not only
the generation of visually compelling content but also the capacity to add
novel, expressive, and artistically rich transformations to images. Unlike
conventional editing tasks that rely on direct prompt-based modifications,
creative image editing demands an autonomous, iterative approach that balances
originality, coherence, and artistic intent. To address this, we introduce
CREA, a novel multi-agent collaborative framework that mimics the human
creative process. Our framework leverages a team of specialized AI agents who
dynamically collaborate to conceptualize, generate, critique, and enhance
images. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we
demonstrate that CREA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
diversity, semantic alignment, and creative transformation. By structuring
creativity as a dynamic, agentic process, CREA redefines the intersection of AI
and art, paving the way for autonomous AI-driven artistic exploration,
generative design, and human-AI co-creation. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work to introduce the task of creative editing.


## AI 摘要

本文提出CREA框架，通过多智能体协作模拟人类创作过程，解决AI图像创作的原创性与艺术性挑战。该系统由多个专业AI代理组成，能自主完成构思、生成、评价和优化图像的迭代流程。相比基于提示的直接修改方法，CREA在多样性、语义对齐和创意转化方面显著优于现有技术，实现了艺术意图与连贯性的平衡。该研究首次将"创意编辑"定义为独立任务，为AI艺术探索、生成式设计和人机协同创作开辟了新路径。实验表明，CREA能产生更具表现力和新颖性的视觉内容，重新定义了AI与艺术的交叉领域。
