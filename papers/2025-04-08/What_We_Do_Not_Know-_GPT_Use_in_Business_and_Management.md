# What We Do Not Know: GPT Use in Business and Management

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05273v1

## 原始摘要

This systematic review examines peer-reviewed studies on application of GPT
in business management, revealing significant knowledge gaps. Despite
identifying interesting research directions such as best practices,
benchmarking, performance comparisons, social impacts, our analysis yields only
42 relevant studies for the 22 months since its release. There are so few
studies looking at a particular sector or subfield that management researchers,
business consultants, policymakers, and journalists do not yet have enough
information to make well-founded statements on how GPT is being used in
businesses. The primary contribution of this paper is a call to action for
further research. We provide a description of current research and identify
knowledge gaps on the use of GPT in business. We cover the management subfields
of finance, marketing, human resources, strategy, operations, production, and
analytics, excluding retail and sales. We discuss gaps in knowledge of GPT
potential consequences on employment, productivity, environmental costs,
oppression, and small businesses. We propose how management consultants and the
media can help fill those gaps. We call for practical work on business control
systems as they relate to existing and foreseeable AI-related business
challenges. This work may be of interest to managers, to management
researchers, and to people working on AI in society.


## AI 摘要

这篇系统综述分析了GPT在商业管理中的应用研究，发现存在显著的知识缺口。尽管提出了最佳实践、基准测试、性能比较、社会影响等研究方向，但在GPT发布后的22个月内仅找到42项相关研究。现有研究过于稀少，无法为管理学者、商业顾问、政策制定者和记者提供足够依据来评估GPT在企业中的实际应用。论文呼吁加强对GPT在财务、营销、人力资源等管理子领域的研究，关注其对就业、生产力、环境成本等方面的影响，并建议管理顾问和媒体协助填补这些知识空白。该研究对管理者、学者和AI社会影响研究者具有参考价值。
