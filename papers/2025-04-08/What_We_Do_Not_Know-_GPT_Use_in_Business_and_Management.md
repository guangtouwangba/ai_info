# What We Do Not Know: GPT Use in Business and Management

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05273v1

## 原始摘要

This systematic review examines peer-reviewed studies on application of GPT
in business management, revealing significant knowledge gaps. Despite
identifying interesting research directions such as best practices,
benchmarking, performance comparisons, social impacts, our analysis yields only
42 relevant studies for the 22 months since its release. There are so few
studies looking at a particular sector or subfield that management researchers,
business consultants, policymakers, and journalists do not yet have enough
information to make well-founded statements on how GPT is being used in
businesses. The primary contribution of this paper is a call to action for
further research. We provide a description of current research and identify
knowledge gaps on the use of GPT in business. We cover the management subfields
of finance, marketing, human resources, strategy, operations, production, and
analytics, excluding retail and sales. We discuss gaps in knowledge of GPT
potential consequences on employment, productivity, environmental costs,
oppression, and small businesses. We propose how management consultants and the
media can help fill those gaps. We call for practical work on business control
systems as they relate to existing and foreseeable AI-related business
challenges. This work may be of interest to managers, to management
researchers, and to people working on AI in society.


## AI 摘要

这篇系统综述分析了GPT在商业管理中的应用研究，发现自GPT发布22个月以来仅有42项相关研究，存在显著知识空白。研究指出在财务、营销、人力资源等管理子领域，以及就业影响、生产力、环境成本等潜在后果方面缺乏深入探讨。尽管提出了最佳实践、性能比较等研究方向，但目前数据不足，难以为管理者、政策制定者等群体提供可靠依据。论文呼吁加强GPT商业应用研究，建议管理顾问和媒体参与填补空白，并关注AI相关商业挑战的控制系统建设。该研究对管理者、学者及AI社会影响研究者具有参考价值。（99字）
