# What We Do Not Know: GPT Use in Business and Management

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05273v1

## 原始摘要

This systematic review examines peer-reviewed studies on application of GPT
in business management, revealing significant knowledge gaps. Despite
identifying interesting research directions such as best practices,
benchmarking, performance comparisons, social impacts, our analysis yields only
42 relevant studies for the 22 months since its release. There are so few
studies looking at a particular sector or subfield that management researchers,
business consultants, policymakers, and journalists do not yet have enough
information to make well-founded statements on how GPT is being used in
businesses. The primary contribution of this paper is a call to action for
further research. We provide a description of current research and identify
knowledge gaps on the use of GPT in business. We cover the management subfields
of finance, marketing, human resources, strategy, operations, production, and
analytics, excluding retail and sales. We discuss gaps in knowledge of GPT
potential consequences on employment, productivity, environmental costs,
oppression, and small businesses. We propose how management consultants and the
media can help fill those gaps. We call for practical work on business control
systems as they relate to existing and foreseeable AI-related business
challenges. This work may be of interest to managers, to management
researchers, and to people working on AI in society.


## AI 摘要

这篇系统综述分析了GPT在商业管理中的应用研究，发现该领域存在显著的知识缺口。尽管研究指出了最佳实践、基准测试、性能比较和社会影响等方向，但GPT发布22个月来仅有42篇相关研究。目前缺乏针对特定行业或细分领域的研究，导致学者、顾问、政策制定者和记者难以准确评估GPT在企业中的实际应用。文章呼吁加强研究，梳理了财务、营销、人力资源等管理子领域的现状，并指出在就业影响、生产力、环境成本等方面的认知不足。同时建议管理顾问和媒体协助填补这些空白，为管理者和AI研究者提供参考。
