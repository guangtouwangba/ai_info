# How to evaluate control measures for LLM agents? A trajectory from today to superintelligence

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05259v1

## 原始摘要

As LLM agents grow more capable of causing harm autonomously, AI developers
will rely on increasingly sophisticated control measures to prevent possibly
misaligned agents from causing harm. AI developers could demonstrate that their
control measures are sufficient by running control evaluations: testing
exercises in which a red team produces agents that try to subvert control
measures. To ensure control evaluations accurately capture misalignment risks,
the affordances granted to this red team should be adapted to the capability
profiles of the agents to be deployed under control measures.
  In this paper we propose a systematic framework for adapting affordances of
red teams to advancing AI capabilities. Rather than assuming that agents will
always execute the best attack strategies known to humans, we demonstrate how
knowledge of an agents's actual capability profile can inform proportional
control evaluations, resulting in more practical and cost-effective control
measures. We illustrate our framework by considering a sequence of five
fictional models (M1-M5) with progressively advanced capabilities, defining
five distinct AI control levels (ACLs). For each ACL, we provide example rules
for control evaluation, control measures, and safety cases that could be
appropriate. Finally, we show why constructing a compelling AI control safety
case for superintelligent LLM agents will require research breakthroughs,
highlighting that we might eventually need alternative approaches to mitigating
misalignment risk.


## AI 摘要

随着AI代理能力增强，自主造成危害的风险上升，开发者需采用更复杂的控制措施。本文提出通过"控制评估"测试控制措施有效性：红队模拟代理尝试突破控制。关键在于根据代理实际能力调整红队权限，而非假设其总采用人类已知最优攻击策略。作者构建了系统框架，将五个虚构模型(M1-M5)对应五个AI控制等级(ACL)，为每个等级提供评估规则、控制措施和安全案例。研究指出，要为超级智能LLM代理构建可靠安全案例仍需突破性研究，最终可能需要替代方案解决对齐风险。
