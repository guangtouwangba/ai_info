# How to evaluate control measures for LLM agents? A trajectory from today to superintelligence

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05259v1

## 原始摘要

As LLM agents grow more capable of causing harm autonomously, AI developers
will rely on increasingly sophisticated control measures to prevent possibly
misaligned agents from causing harm. AI developers could demonstrate that their
control measures are sufficient by running control evaluations: testing
exercises in which a red team produces agents that try to subvert control
measures. To ensure control evaluations accurately capture misalignment risks,
the affordances granted to this red team should be adapted to the capability
profiles of the agents to be deployed under control measures.
  In this paper we propose a systematic framework for adapting affordances of
red teams to advancing AI capabilities. Rather than assuming that agents will
always execute the best attack strategies known to humans, we demonstrate how
knowledge of an agents's actual capability profile can inform proportional
control evaluations, resulting in more practical and cost-effective control
measures. We illustrate our framework by considering a sequence of five
fictional models (M1-M5) with progressively advanced capabilities, defining
five distinct AI control levels (ACLs). For each ACL, we provide example rules
for control evaluation, control measures, and safety cases that could be
appropriate. Finally, we show why constructing a compelling AI control safety
case for superintelligent LLM agents will require research breakthroughs,
highlighting that we might eventually need alternative approaches to mitigating
misalignment risk.


## AI 摘要

随着AI代理能力的提升，其潜在危害风险增加，开发者需通过控制评估（如红队测试）验证安全措施的有效性。本文提出系统框架，根据AI能力动态调整红队测试权限，避免过度依赖人类已知攻击策略，使评估更符合实际风险。作者虚构了5个能力递增的AI模型（M1-M5），对应5级AI控制等级（ACLs），每级提供评估规则、控制措施及安全方案。最后指出，针对超智能AI的安全论证需突破性研究，未来可能需要新的对齐风险解决方案。（100字）
