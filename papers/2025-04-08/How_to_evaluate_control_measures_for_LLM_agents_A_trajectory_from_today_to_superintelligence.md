# How to evaluate control measures for LLM agents? A trajectory from today to superintelligence

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05259v1

## 原始摘要

As LLM agents grow more capable of causing harm autonomously, AI developers
will rely on increasingly sophisticated control measures to prevent possibly
misaligned agents from causing harm. AI developers could demonstrate that their
control measures are sufficient by running control evaluations: testing
exercises in which a red team produces agents that try to subvert control
measures. To ensure control evaluations accurately capture misalignment risks,
the affordances granted to this red team should be adapted to the capability
profiles of the agents to be deployed under control measures.
  In this paper we propose a systematic framework for adapting affordances of
red teams to advancing AI capabilities. Rather than assuming that agents will
always execute the best attack strategies known to humans, we demonstrate how
knowledge of an agents's actual capability profile can inform proportional
control evaluations, resulting in more practical and cost-effective control
measures. We illustrate our framework by considering a sequence of five
fictional models (M1-M5) with progressively advanced capabilities, defining
five distinct AI control levels (ACLs). For each ACL, we provide example rules
for control evaluation, control measures, and safety cases that could be
appropriate. Finally, we show why constructing a compelling AI control safety
case for superintelligent LLM agents will require research breakthroughs,
highlighting that we might eventually need alternative approaches to mitigating
misalignment risk.


## AI 摘要

随着AI代理能力的提升，其自主造成危害的风险增加。本文提出一个系统性框架，通过调整红队的测试权限来匹配AI的实际能力水平，从而更准确地评估控制措施的有效性。作者设计了五个递增的AI控制等级（ACLs），针对不同能力阶段的模型（M1-M5）提供对应的评估规则、控制措施和安全方案。研究表明，对于超级智能LLM代理，现有方法可能不足，需要研究突破或替代方案来应对错位风险。该框架旨在实现更实用、经济的控制措施，避免过度依赖人类已知的最佳攻击策略假设。
