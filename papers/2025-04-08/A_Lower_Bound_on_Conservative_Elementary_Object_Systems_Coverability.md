# A Lower Bound on Conservative Elementary Object Systems Coverability

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03591v1

## 原始摘要

Elementary Object Systems (EOS) are a form of Petri Net (PN) where tokens
carry internal PN. This model has been recently proposed for analysis of
robustness of Multi Agent Systems. While EOS reachability is known to be
undecidable, the decidability of coverability of its conservative fragment
(where the type of internal PN cannot be completely deleted and, thus, is
conserved) was proved a decade ago, no study charted its complexity. Here, we
take a first step in this direction, by showing how to encode $\nu$PNs, a well
studied form of PN enriched with data, into conservative EOS (cEOS). This
yields a non-Primitive Recursive, $F_{\omega2}$ lower-bound on cEOS
coverability.


## AI 摘要

基本对象系统（EOS）是一种带有内部Petri网的令牌模型，用于分析多智能体系统的鲁棒性。虽然EOS的可达性不可判定，但其保守片段（内部网类型不可完全删除）的可覆盖性已被证明是可判定的，但复杂度未知。本研究首次通过将带数据的νPN编码到保守EOS（cEOS）中，证明了cEOS可覆盖性的下界为非原始递归的Fω2复杂度。
