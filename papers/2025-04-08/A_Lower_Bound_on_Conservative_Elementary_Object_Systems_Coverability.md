# A Lower Bound on Conservative Elementary Object Systems Coverability

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03591v1

## 原始摘要

Elementary Object Systems (EOS) are a form of Petri Net (PN) where tokens
carry internal PN. This model has been recently proposed for analysis of
robustness of Multi Agent Systems. While EOS reachability is known to be
undecidable, the decidability of coverability of its conservative fragment
(where the type of internal PN cannot be completely deleted and, thus, is
conserved) was proved a decade ago, no study charted its complexity. Here, we
take a first step in this direction, by showing how to encode $\nu$PNs, a well
studied form of PN enriched with data, into conservative EOS (cEOS). This
yields a non-Primitive Recursive, $F_{\omega2}$ lower-bound on cEOS
coverability.


## AI 摘要

本文研究了保守基本对象系统（cEOS）的可覆盖性问题。cEOS是一种令牌携带内部Petri网的扩展Petri网模型，用于分析多智能体系统的鲁棒性。虽然EOS的可达性不可判定，但保守片段（内部网结构不会被完全删除）的可覆盖性已被证明是可判定的。研究首次通过将带数据的νPetri网编码到cEOS中，确立了cEOS可覆盖性的复杂度下界为非原始递归的Fω2类。这一结果为理解cEOS的计算复杂性迈出了重要一步。
