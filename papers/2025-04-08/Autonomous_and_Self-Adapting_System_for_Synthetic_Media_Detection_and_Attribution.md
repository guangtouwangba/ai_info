# Autonomous and Self-Adapting System for Synthetic Media Detection and Attribution

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03615v1

## 原始摘要

Rapid advances in generative AI have enabled the creation of highly realistic
synthetic images, which, while beneficial in many domains, also pose serious
risks in terms of disinformation, fraud, and other malicious applications.
Current synthetic image identification systems are typically static, relying on
feature representations learned from known generators; as new generative models
emerge, these systems suffer from severe performance degradation. In this
paper, we introduce the concept of an autonomous self-adaptive synthetic media
identification system -- one that not only detects synthetic images and
attributes them to known sources but also autonomously identifies and
incorporates novel generators without human intervention. Our approach
leverages an open-set identification strategy with an evolvable embedding space
that distinguishes between known and unknown sources. By employing an
unsupervised clustering method to aggregate unknown samples into
high-confidence clusters and continuously refining its decision boundaries, our
system maintains robust detection and attribution performance even as the
generative landscape evolves. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing approaches, marking a crucial step toward
universal, adaptable forensic systems in the era of rapidly advancing
generative models.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文提出了一种自主自适应的合成媒体识别系统，用于应对日益逼真的AI生成图像带来的虚假信息风险。传统静态识别系统面对新型生成模型时性能会大幅下降，而新系统通过开放集识别策略和可演化的嵌入空间，不仅能检测已知来源的合成图像，还能自主识别并整合未知生成器。系统采用无监督聚类方法将未知样本聚集成高置信度簇，并持续优化决策边界，从而在生成模型快速发展的环境中保持稳定的检测和溯源性能。实验表明，该方法显著优于现有方案，为实现通用、自适应的取证系统迈出关键一步。
