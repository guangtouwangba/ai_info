# Superhuman Game AI Disclosure: Expertise and Context Moderate Effects on Trust and Fairness

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15514v2

## 原始摘要

As artificial intelligence surpasses human performance in select tasks,
disclosing superhuman capabilities poses distinct challenges for fairness,
accountability, and trust. However, the impact of such disclosures on diverse
user attitudes and behaviors remains unclear, particularly concerning potential
negative reactions like discouragement or overreliance. This paper investigates
these effects by utilizing Persona Cards: a validated, standardized set of
synthetic personas designed to simulate diverse user reactions and fairness
perspectives. We conducted an ethics board-approved study (N=32), utilizing
these personas to investigate how capability disclosure influenced behaviors
with a superhuman game AI in competitive StarCraft II scenarios. Our results
reveal transparency is double-edged: while disclosure could alleviate
suspicion, it also provoked frustration and strategic defeatism among novices
in cooperative scenarios, as well as overreliance in competitive contexts.
Experienced and competitive players interpreted disclosure as confirmation of
an unbeatable opponent, shifting to suboptimal goals. We release the Persona
Cards Dataset, including profiles, prompts, interaction logs, and protocols, to
foster reproducible research into human alignment AI design. This work
demonstrates that transparency is not a cure-all; successfully leveraging
disclosure to enhance trust and accountability requires careful tailoring to
user characteristics, domain norms, and specific fairness objectives.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了AI在特定任务中超越人类表现时，披露其超强能力对用户态度和行为的影响。通过使用标准化的"角色卡"模拟不同用户反应，研究发现透明度具有双刃剑效应：虽然能减轻怀疑，但也引发新手在合作场景中的挫败感，以及竞争环境下的过度依赖。资深玩家则会将披露视为对手不可战胜的确认，转而追求次优目标。研究表明，透明度并非万能药，要有效利用披露来增强信任和问责，需根据用户特征、领域规范和具体公平目标进行精心设计。研究发布了"角色卡数据集"以促进可重复研究。
