# LLM-based Automated Grading with Human-in-the-Loop

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05239v1

## 原始摘要

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly large
language models (LLMs), has brought significant advancements to the field of
education. Among various applications, automatic short answer grading (ASAG),
which focuses on evaluating open-ended textual responses, has seen remarkable
progress with the introduction of LLMs. These models not only enhance grading
performance compared to traditional ASAG approaches but also move beyond simple
comparisons with predefined "golden" answers, enabling more sophisticated
grading scenarios, such as rubric-based evaluation. However, existing
LLM-powered methods still face challenges in achieving human-level grading
performance in rubric-based assessments due to their reliance on fully
automated approaches. In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs in ASAG
tasks by leveraging their interactive capabilities through a human-in-the-loop
(HITL) approach. Our proposed framework, GradeHITL, utilizes the generative
properties of LLMs to pose questions to human experts, incorporating their
insights to refine grading rubrics dynamically. This adaptive process
significantly improves grading accuracy, outperforming existing methods and
bringing ASAG closer to human-level evaluation.


## AI 摘要

大型语言模型（LLMs）推动了自动短答案评分（ASAG）的发展，超越传统方法，支持基于评分标准的评估。然而，现有全自动方法在标准评估中仍难以达到人类水平。本研究提出GradeHITL框架，通过人机协同（HITL）利用LLMs的交互能力，动态优化评分标准。LLMs生成问题征求专家意见，整合反馈提升评分准确性。该方法显著优于现有技术，使ASAG更接近人类评估水平。
