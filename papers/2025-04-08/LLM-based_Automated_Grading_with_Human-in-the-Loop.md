# LLM-based Automated Grading with Human-in-the-Loop

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05239v1

## 原始摘要

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, particularly large
language models (LLMs), has brought significant advancements to the field of
education. Among various applications, automatic short answer grading (ASAG),
which focuses on evaluating open-ended textual responses, has seen remarkable
progress with the introduction of LLMs. These models not only enhance grading
performance compared to traditional ASAG approaches but also move beyond simple
comparisons with predefined "golden" answers, enabling more sophisticated
grading scenarios, such as rubric-based evaluation. However, existing
LLM-powered methods still face challenges in achieving human-level grading
performance in rubric-based assessments due to their reliance on fully
automated approaches. In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs in ASAG
tasks by leveraging their interactive capabilities through a human-in-the-loop
(HITL) approach. Our proposed framework, GradeHITL, utilizes the generative
properties of LLMs to pose questions to human experts, incorporating their
insights to refine grading rubrics dynamically. This adaptive process
significantly improves grading accuracy, outperforming existing methods and
bringing ASAG closer to human-level evaluation.


## AI 摘要

人工智能（AI）尤其是大语言模型（LLM）在教育领域的自动简答题评分（ASAG）中取得显著进展。传统ASAG依赖标准答案对比，而LLM能实现更复杂的评分，如基于量规的评估。然而，现有全自动方法在量规评估中仍难以达到人类水平。本研究提出GradeHITL框架，通过人机协同（HITL）利用LLM的交互能力，动态优化评分量规。该方法结合专家反馈，显著提升评分准确性，超越现有方法，使ASAG更接近人类评估水平。
