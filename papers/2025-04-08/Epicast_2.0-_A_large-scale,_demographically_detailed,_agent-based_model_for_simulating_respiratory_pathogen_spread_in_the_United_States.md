# Epicast 2.0: A large-scale, demographically detailed, agent-based model for simulating respiratory pathogen spread in the United States

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03604v1

## 原始摘要

The recent history of respiratory pathogen epidemics, including those caused
by influenza and SARS-CoV-2, has highlighted the urgent need for advanced
modeling approaches that can accurately capture heterogeneous disease dynamics
and outcomes at the national scale, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of
resource allocation and decision-making. In this paper, we describe Epicast
2.0, an agent-based model that utilizes a highly detailed, synthetic population
and high-performance computing techniques to simulate respiratory pathogen
transmission across the entire United States. This model replicates the contact
patterns of over 320 million agents as they engage in daily activities at
school, work, and within their communities. Epicast 2.0 supports vaccination
and an array of non-pharmaceutical interventions that can be promoted or
relaxed via highly granular, user specified policies. We illustrate the model's
capabilities using a wide range of outbreak scenarios, highlighting the model's
varied dynamics as well as its extensive support for policy exploration. This
model provides a robust platform for conducting what if scenario analysis and
providing insights into potential strategies for mitigating the impacts of
infectious diseases.


## AI 摘要

本文介绍了Epicast 2.0，这是一个基于代理的模型，利用高精度合成人口和高性能计算技术模拟美国全境的呼吸道病原体传播。该模型覆盖3.2亿个代理的日常接触模式（如学校、工作和社区活动），支持疫苗接种和非药物干预措施，并能根据用户设定的精细政策进行调整。通过多种疫情情景测试，Epicast 2.0展现了动态模拟和政策探索能力，为传染病防控策略的"假设分析"提供了强大平台，有助于优化资源分配和决策制定。该模型旨在应对流感、COVID-19等疫情的复杂传播动态，提升国家层级的应对效率。
