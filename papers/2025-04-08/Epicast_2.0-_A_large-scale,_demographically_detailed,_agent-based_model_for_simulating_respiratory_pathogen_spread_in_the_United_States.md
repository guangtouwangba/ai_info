# Epicast 2.0: A large-scale, demographically detailed, agent-based model for simulating respiratory pathogen spread in the United States

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03604v1

## 原始摘要

The recent history of respiratory pathogen epidemics, including those caused
by influenza and SARS-CoV-2, has highlighted the urgent need for advanced
modeling approaches that can accurately capture heterogeneous disease dynamics
and outcomes at the national scale, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of
resource allocation and decision-making. In this paper, we describe Epicast
2.0, an agent-based model that utilizes a highly detailed, synthetic population
and high-performance computing techniques to simulate respiratory pathogen
transmission across the entire United States. This model replicates the contact
patterns of over 320 million agents as they engage in daily activities at
school, work, and within their communities. Epicast 2.0 supports vaccination
and an array of non-pharmaceutical interventions that can be promoted or
relaxed via highly granular, user specified policies. We illustrate the model's
capabilities using a wide range of outbreak scenarios, highlighting the model's
varied dynamics as well as its extensive support for policy exploration. This
model provides a robust platform for conducting what if scenario analysis and
providing insights into potential strategies for mitigating the impacts of
infectious diseases.


## AI 摘要

本文介绍了Epicast 2.0——一个基于智能体的全国性呼吸道传染病传播模型。该模型通过高性能计算技术，利用高度精细的合成人口数据模拟美国3.2亿人口的日常接触模式（包括学校、工作和社区活动），支持疫苗接种和非药物干预措施的精细化政策设置。研究展示了该模型在不同疫情场景下的应用能力，突显其在政策探索和"假设"情景分析方面的优势。Epicast 2.0为资源分配决策提供了强大平台，有助于制定更有效的传染病防控策略。该模型的发展回应了近期流感与COVID-19等疫情对精准预测工具的迫切需求。
