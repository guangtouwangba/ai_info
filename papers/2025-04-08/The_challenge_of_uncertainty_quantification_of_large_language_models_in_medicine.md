# The challenge of uncertainty quantification of large language models in medicine

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05278v1

## 原始摘要

This study investigates uncertainty quantification in large language models
(LLMs) for medical applications, emphasizing both technical innovations and
philosophical implications. As LLMs become integral to clinical
decision-making, accurately communicating uncertainty is crucial for ensuring
reliable, safe, and ethical AI-assisted healthcare. Our research frames
uncertainty not as a barrier but as an essential part of knowledge that invites
a dynamic and reflective approach to AI design. By integrating advanced
probabilistic methods such as Bayesian inference, deep ensembles, and Monte
Carlo dropout with linguistic analysis that computes predictive and semantic
entropy, we propose a comprehensive framework that manages both epistemic and
aleatoric uncertainties. The framework incorporates surrogate modeling to
address limitations of proprietary APIs, multi-source data integration for
better context, and dynamic calibration via continual and meta-learning.
Explainability is embedded through uncertainty maps and confidence metrics to
support user trust and clinical interpretability. Our approach supports
transparent and ethical decision-making aligned with Responsible and Reflective
AI principles. Philosophically, we advocate accepting controlled ambiguity
instead of striving for absolute predictability, recognizing the inherent
provisionality of medical knowledge.


## AI 摘要

这项研究探讨了大语言模型(LLMs)在医疗应用中的不确定性量化问题，结合技术创新与哲学思考。随着LLMs参与临床决策，准确传达不确定性对确保AI辅助医疗的可靠性、安全性和伦理性至关重要。研究提出将不确定性视为知识的重要组成部分而非障碍，采用贝叶斯推理、深度集成和蒙特卡洛dropout等概率方法，结合预测熵和语义熵的语言分析，构建综合框架处理认知和随机不确定性。该框架整合替代模型、多源数据和动态校准技术，通过不确定性图谱和置信度指标增强可解释性，倡导在可控模糊性基础上实现透明、负责任的医疗AI决策。
