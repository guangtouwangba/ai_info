# The challenge of uncertainty quantification of large language models in medicine

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05278v1

## 原始摘要

This study investigates uncertainty quantification in large language models
(LLMs) for medical applications, emphasizing both technical innovations and
philosophical implications. As LLMs become integral to clinical
decision-making, accurately communicating uncertainty is crucial for ensuring
reliable, safe, and ethical AI-assisted healthcare. Our research frames
uncertainty not as a barrier but as an essential part of knowledge that invites
a dynamic and reflective approach to AI design. By integrating advanced
probabilistic methods such as Bayesian inference, deep ensembles, and Monte
Carlo dropout with linguistic analysis that computes predictive and semantic
entropy, we propose a comprehensive framework that manages both epistemic and
aleatoric uncertainties. The framework incorporates surrogate modeling to
address limitations of proprietary APIs, multi-source data integration for
better context, and dynamic calibration via continual and meta-learning.
Explainability is embedded through uncertainty maps and confidence metrics to
support user trust and clinical interpretability. Our approach supports
transparent and ethical decision-making aligned with Responsible and Reflective
AI principles. Philosophically, we advocate accepting controlled ambiguity
instead of striving for absolute predictability, recognizing the inherent
provisionality of medical knowledge.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了大语言模型(LLMs)在医疗应用中的不确定性量化问题，结合技术创新与哲学思考。研究提出将贝叶斯推断、深度集成和蒙特卡洛dropout等概率方法，与预测熵和语义熵的语言分析相结合，构建了一个管理认知和随机不确定性的综合框架。该框架通过代理模型处理专有API限制，整合多源数据优化上下文，并采用持续学习和元学习进行动态校准。研究强调不确定性是知识的必要组成部分，主张接受可控模糊性而非追求绝对可预测性，以符合负责任AI原则，支持透明、可信的临床决策。
