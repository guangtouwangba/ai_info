# GenoTEX: A Benchmark for Automated Gene Expression Data Analysis in Alignment with Bioinformaticians

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15341v2

## 原始摘要

Recent advancements in machine learning have significantly improved the
identification of disease-associated genes from gene expression datasets.
However, these processes often require extensive expertise and manual effort,
limiting their scalability. Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown
promise in automating these tasks due to their increasing problem-solving
abilities. To support the evaluation and development of such methods, we
introduce GenoTEX, a benchmark dataset for the automated analysis of gene
expression data. GenoTEX provides annotated code and results for solving a wide
range of gene identification problems, encompassing dataset selection,
preprocessing, and statistical analysis, in a pipeline that follows
computational genomics standards. The benchmark includes expert-curated
annotations from bioinformaticians to ensure accuracy and reliability. To
provide baselines for these tasks, we present GenoAgent, a team of LLM-based
agents that adopt a multi-step programming workflow with flexible
self-correction, to collaboratively analyze gene expression datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate the potential of LLM-based methods in analyzing genomic
data, while error analysis highlights the challenges and areas for future
improvement. We propose GenoTEX as a promising resource for benchmarking and
enhancing automated methods for gene expression data analysis. The benchmark is

## AI 摘要

近期机器学习在基因表达数据疾病相关基因识别方面取得显著进展，但这些过程通常需要大量专业知识和人工操作，限制了可扩展性。研究者提出GenoTEX基准数据集，包含符合计算基因组学标准的完整分析流程（数据选择、预处理、统计分析）的标注代码和结果，并经过生物信息学专家验证。同时开发了基于大语言模型的多智能体系统GenoAgent，采用多步骤编程和自校正机制协作分析基因数据。实验表明该方法具有潜力，但也存在挑战。该基准数据集（https://github.com/Liu-Hy/GenoTex）为自动化基因表达分析提供了评估资源。（99字）
