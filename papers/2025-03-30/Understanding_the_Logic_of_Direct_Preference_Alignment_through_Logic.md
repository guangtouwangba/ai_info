# Understanding the Logic of Direct Preference Alignment through Logic

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17696v2

## 原始摘要

Recent direct preference alignment algorithms (DPA), such as DPO, have shown
great promise in aligning large language models to human preferences. While
this has motivated the development of many new variants of the original DPO
loss, understanding the differences between these recent proposals, as well as
developing new DPA loss functions, remains difficult given the lack of a
technical and conceptual framework for reasoning about the underlying semantics
of these algorithms. In this paper, we attempt to remedy this by formalizing
DPA losses in terms of discrete reasoning problems. Specifically, we ask: Given
an existing DPA loss, can we systematically derive a symbolic program that
characterizes its semantics? We propose a novel formalism for characterizing
preference losses for single model and reference model based approaches, and
identify symbolic forms for a number of commonly used DPA variants. Further, we
show how this formal view of preference learning sheds new light on both the
size and structure of the DPA loss landscape, making it possible to not only
rigorously characterize the relationships between recent loss proposals but
also to systematically explore the landscape and derive new loss functions from
first principles. We hope our framework and findings will help provide useful
guidance to those working on human AI alignment.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种新的形式化框架，用于理解和分析直接偏好对齐(DPA)算法（如DPO）的语义。通过将DPA损失函数建模为离散推理问题，该研究系统性地推导出描述算法语义的符号程序，并识别了多种常见DPA变体的符号形式。这一形式化视角不仅揭示了DPA损失函数的结构特征和相互关系，还为新损失函数的设计提供了系统化方法。该框架有助于更清晰地理解现有DPA算法差异，并为人类-AI对齐研究提供理论指导。研究结果表明，该方法能促进对偏好学习损失函数空间的系统性探索和创新。
