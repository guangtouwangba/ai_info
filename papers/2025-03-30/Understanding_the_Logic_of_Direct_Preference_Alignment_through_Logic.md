# Understanding the Logic of Direct Preference Alignment through Logic

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17696v2

## 原始摘要

Recent direct preference alignment algorithms (DPA), such as DPO, have shown
great promise in aligning large language models to human preferences. While
this has motivated the development of many new variants of the original DPO
loss, understanding the differences between these recent proposals, as well as
developing new DPA loss functions, remains difficult given the lack of a
technical and conceptual framework for reasoning about the underlying semantics
of these algorithms. In this paper, we attempt to remedy this by formalizing
DPA losses in terms of discrete reasoning problems. Specifically, we ask: Given
an existing DPA loss, can we systematically derive a symbolic program that
characterizes its semantics? We propose a novel formalism for characterizing
preference losses for single model and reference model based approaches, and
identify symbolic forms for a number of commonly used DPA variants. Further, we
show how this formal view of preference learning sheds new light on both the
size and structure of the DPA loss landscape, making it possible to not only
rigorously characterize the relationships between recent loss proposals but
also to systematically explore the landscape and derive new loss functions from
first principles. We hope our framework and findings will help provide useful
guidance to those working on human AI alignment.


## AI 摘要

近期直接偏好对齐算法（DPA）如DPO在使大语言模型符合人类偏好方面展现出潜力，但缺乏统一框架来理解不同变种间的差异。本研究提出一种基于离散推理问题的形式化方法，将DPA损失函数转化为符号程序以系统化解析其语义。该框架不仅揭示了单模型和参考模型方法的偏好损失特征，还识别了常见DPA变种的符号形式，为理解损失函数间的关联提供了新视角。研究通过形式化分析拓展了DPA损失的设计空间，有助于从原理出发开发新算法，推动人机对齐领域的发展。
