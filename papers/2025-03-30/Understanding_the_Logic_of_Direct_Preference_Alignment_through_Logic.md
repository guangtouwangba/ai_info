# Understanding the Logic of Direct Preference Alignment through Logic

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17696v2

## 原始摘要

Recent direct preference alignment algorithms (DPA), such as DPO, have shown
great promise in aligning large language models to human preferences. While
this has motivated the development of many new variants of the original DPO
loss, understanding the differences between these recent proposals, as well as
developing new DPA loss functions, remains difficult given the lack of a
technical and conceptual framework for reasoning about the underlying semantics
of these algorithms. In this paper, we attempt to remedy this by formalizing
DPA losses in terms of discrete reasoning problems. Specifically, we ask: Given
an existing DPA loss, can we systematically derive a symbolic program that
characterizes its semantics? We propose a novel formalism for characterizing
preference losses for single model and reference model based approaches, and
identify symbolic forms for a number of commonly used DPA variants. Further, we
show how this formal view of preference learning sheds new light on both the
size and structure of the DPA loss landscape, making it possible to not only
rigorously characterize the relationships between recent loss proposals but
also to systematically explore the landscape and derive new loss functions from
first principles. We hope our framework and findings will help provide useful
guidance to those working on human AI alignment.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种新的形式化框架，用于分析和比较直接偏好对齐(DPA)算法（如DPO）的损失函数。通过将DPA损失转化为符号程序，作者系统性地揭示了多种常见DPA变体的语义特征。该框架不仅能够严格表征不同损失函数之间的关系，还能从基本原理出发探索损失函数空间并推导新算法。这一形式化视角为理解人类偏好学习提供了新见解，有助于阐明现有DPA变体间的差异，并为开发新对齐算法提供系统指导。研究旨在促进人类-AI对齐领域的发展，为相关研究提供理论基础和方法论支持。
