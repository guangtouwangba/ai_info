# Understanding the Logic of Direct Preference Alignment through Logic

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17696v2

## 原始摘要

Recent direct preference alignment algorithms (DPA), such as DPO, have shown
great promise in aligning large language models to human preferences. While
this has motivated the development of many new variants of the original DPO
loss, understanding the differences between these recent proposals, as well as
developing new DPA loss functions, remains difficult given the lack of a
technical and conceptual framework for reasoning about the underlying semantics
of these algorithms. In this paper, we attempt to remedy this by formalizing
DPA losses in terms of discrete reasoning problems. Specifically, we ask: Given
an existing DPA loss, can we systematically derive a symbolic program that
characterizes its semantics? We propose a novel formalism for characterizing
preference losses for single model and reference model based approaches, and
identify symbolic forms for a number of commonly used DPA variants. Further, we
show how this formal view of preference learning sheds new light on both the
size and structure of the DPA loss landscape, making it possible to not only
rigorously characterize the relationships between recent loss proposals but
also to systematically explore the landscape and derive new loss functions from
first principles. We hope our framework and findings will help provide useful
guidance to those working on human AI alignment.


## AI 摘要

近期直接偏好对齐算法（如DPO）在将大语言模型与人类偏好对齐方面展现出潜力，但由于缺乏技术框架来理解其底层语义，开发新变体仍具挑战。本文提出一种基于离散推理问题的形式化方法，将DPA损失转化为符号程序以系统化其语义，并针对单模型和参考模型方法建立了偏好损失的形式化表征。通过分析常见DPA变体的符号形式，该框架揭示了损失函数的规模与结构特征，既能严格比较现有方法，也能从原理出发推导新损失函数，为人类-AI对齐研究提供理论指导。
