# A Role of Environmental Complexity on Representation Learning in Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents

## 原始摘要

We developed a simulated environment to train deep reinforcement learning
agents on a shortcut usage navigation task, motivated by the Dual Solutions
Paradigm test used for human navigators. We manipulated the frequency with
which agents were exposed to a shortcut and a navigation cue, to investigate
how these factors influence shortcut usage development. We find that all agents
rapidly achieve optimal performance in closed shortcut trials once initial
learning starts. However, their navigation speed and shortcut usage when it is
open happen faster in agents with higher shortcut exposure. Analysis of the
agents' artificial neural networks activity revealed that frequent presentation
of a cue initially resulted in better encoding of the cue in the activity of
individual nodes, compared to agents who encountered the cue less often.
However, stronger cue representations were ultimately formed through the use of
the cue in the context of navigation planning, rather than simply through
exposure. We found that in all agents, spatial representations develop early in
training and subsequently stabilize before navigation strategies fully develop,
suggesting that having spatially consistent activations is necessary for basic
navigation, but insufficient for advanced strategies. Further, using new
analysis techniques, we found that the planned trajectory rather than the
agent's immediate location is encoded in the agent's networks. Moreover, the
encoding is represented at the population rather than the individual node
level. These techniques could have broader applications in studying neural
activity across populations of neurons or network nodes beyond individual
activity patterns.


## AI 摘要

研究开发了一个模拟环境，用于训练深度强化学习代理在捷径使用导航任务中的表现，灵感来自人类导航者的双解决方案范式测试。研究发现，代理在封闭捷径试验中一旦开始学习，便能迅速达到最佳表现。高频率接触捷径的代理在捷径开放时导航速度和捷径使用更快。分析显示，频繁呈现的导航线索在初期能更好地编码于单个节点中，但更强的线索表示是通过导航规划中的使用形成的。空间表示在训练早期发展并稳定，而计划轨迹而非当前位置在代理网络中编码，且编码在群体而非单个节点水平上表示。
