# Measuring AI Ability to Complete Long Tasks

## 原始摘要

Despite rapid progress on AI benchmarks, the real-world meaning of benchmark
performance remains unclear. To quantify the capabilities of AI systems in
terms of human capabilities, we propose a new metric: 50%-task-completion time
horizon. This is the time humans typically take to complete tasks that AI
models can complete with 50% success rate. We first timed humans with relevant
domain expertise on a combination of RE-Bench, HCAST, and 66 novel shorter
tasks. On these tasks, current frontier AI models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet
have a 50% time horizon of around 50 minutes. Furthermore, frontier AI time
horizon has been doubling approximately every seven months since 2019, though
the trend may have accelerated in 2024. The increase in AI models' time
horizons seems to be primarily driven by greater reliability and ability to
adapt to mistakes, combined with better logical reasoning and tool use
capabilities. We discuss the limitations of our results -- including their
degree of external validity -- and the implications of increased autonomy for
dangerous capabilities. If these results generalize to real-world software
tasks, extrapolation of this trend predicts that within 5 years, AI systems
will be capable of automating many software tasks that currently take humans a
month.


## AI 摘要

尽管AI基准测试进展迅速，但其实际意义仍不明确。为量化AI系统相对于人类的能力，研究者提出新指标“50%任务完成时间跨度”，即人类完成AI模型50%成功率任务所需时间。研究发现，当前前沿AI模型（如Claude 3.7 Sonnet）在相关任务上的50%时间跨度约为50分钟。自2019年以来，AI的时间跨度每7个月翻倍，2024年可能加速。这一增长主要源于AI的可靠性、错误适应能力、逻辑推理和工具使用能力的提升。若趋势持续，5年内AI或能自动化目前人类需一个月完成的软件任务。
