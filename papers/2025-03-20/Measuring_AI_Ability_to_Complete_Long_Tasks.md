# Measuring AI Ability to Complete Long Tasks

## 原始摘要

Despite rapid progress on AI benchmarks, the real-world meaning of benchmark
performance remains unclear. To quantify the capabilities of AI systems in
terms of human capabilities, we propose a new metric: 50%-task-completion time
horizon. This is the time humans typically take to complete tasks that AI
models can complete with 50% success rate. We first timed humans with relevant
domain expertise on a combination of RE-Bench, HCAST, and 66 novel shorter
tasks. On these tasks, current frontier AI models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet
have a 50% time horizon of around 50 minutes. Furthermore, frontier AI time
horizon has been doubling approximately every seven months since 2019, though
the trend may have accelerated in 2024. The increase in AI models' time
horizons seems to be primarily driven by greater reliability and ability to
adapt to mistakes, combined with better logical reasoning and tool use
capabilities. We discuss the limitations of our results -- including their
degree of external validity -- and the implications of increased autonomy for
dangerous capabilities. If these results generalize to real-world software
tasks, extrapolation of this trend predicts that within 5 years, AI systems
will be capable of automating many software tasks that currently take humans a
month.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种新的AI能力评估指标——50%任务完成时间范围，即人类完成AI模型能以50%成功率完成的任务所需的时间。通过对具有相关领域专业知识的人类进行测试，发现当前前沿AI模型（如Claude 3.7 Sonnet）的50%时间范围约为50分钟。自2019年以来，前沿AI的时间范围大约每七个月翻一番，且2024年可能加速。AI模型时间范围的增加主要归因于更高的可靠性、错误适应能力、逻辑推理和工具使用能力的提升。若此趋势持续，预计五年内AI将能自动化许多当前人类需一个月完成的软件任务。
