# Navigating LLM Ethics: Advancements, Challenges, and Future Directions

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18841v4

## 原始摘要

This study addresses ethical issues surrounding Large Language Models (LLMs)
within the field of artificial intelligence. It explores the common ethical
challenges posed by both LLMs and other AI systems, such as privacy and
fairness, as well as ethical challenges uniquely arising from LLMs. It
highlights challenges such as hallucination, verifiable accountability, and
decoding censorship complexity, which are unique to LLMs and distinct from
those encountered in traditional AI systems. The study underscores the need to
tackle these complexities to ensure accountability, reduce biases, and enhance
transparency in the influential role that LLMs play in shaping information
dissemination. It proposes mitigation strategies and future directions for LLM
ethics, advocating for interdisciplinary collaboration. It recommends ethical
frameworks tailored to specific domains and dynamic auditing systems adapted to
diverse contexts. This roadmap aims to guide responsible development and
integration of LLMs, envisioning a future where ethical considerations govern
AI advancements in society.


## AI 摘要

本研究探讨了人工智能领域中大型语言模型（LLMs）所涉及的伦理问题，包括隐私和公平等常见挑战，以及LLMs特有的问题，如幻觉、可验证的责任和审查复杂性。研究强调需解决这些复杂性以确保责任性、减少偏见并增强透明度，特别是在信息传播方面。提出了缓解策略和未来方向，倡导跨学科合作，推荐针对特定领域的伦理框架和适应多样环境的动态审计系统。旨在引导LLMs的负责任开发和整合，推动以伦理为导向的AI社会进步。
