# Honey, I Shrunk the Language Model: Impact of Knowledge Distillation Methods on Performance and Explainability

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16056v1

## 原始摘要

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has increasingly influenced modern society,
recently in particular through significant advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, high computational and storage demands of LLMs still
limit their deployment in resource-constrained environments. Knowledge
distillation addresses this challenge by training a small student model from a
larger teacher model. Previous research has introduced several distillation
methods for both generating training data and for training the student model.
Despite their relevance, the effects of state-of-the-art distillation methods
on model performance and explainability have not been thoroughly investigated
and compared. In this work, we enlarge the set of available methods by applying
critique-revision prompting to distillation for data generation and by
synthesizing existing methods for training. For these methods, we provide a
systematic comparison based on the widely used Commonsense Question-Answering
(CQA) dataset. While we measure performance via student model accuracy, we
employ a human-grounded study to evaluate explainability. We contribute new
distillation methods and their comparison in terms of both performance and
explainability. This should further advance the distillation of small language
models and, thus, contribute to broader applicability and faster diffusion of
LLM technology.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了知识蒸馏技术在大型语言模型(LLMs)压缩中的应用挑战。针对计算资源受限环境，研究者通过批判性修正提示(critique-revision prompting)改进了训练数据生成方法，并综合现有方法优化学生模型训练。基于常识问答(CQA)数据集的系统评估显示，新方法在模型性能和可解释性方面均有提升。研究通过准确率衡量性能，并采用人工评估可解释性，为小型语言模型的蒸馏提供了新方法比较，有助于推动LLM技术的更广泛应用和快速普及。
