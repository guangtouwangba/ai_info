# Tracing Thought: Using Chain-of-Thought Reasoning to Identify the LLM Behind AI-Generated Text

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16913v1

## 原始摘要

In recent years, the detection of AI-generated text has become a critical
area of research due to concerns about academic integrity, misinformation, and
ethical AI deployment. This paper presents COT Fine-tuned, a novel framework
for detecting AI-generated text and identifying the specific language model.
responsible for generating the text. We propose a dual-task approach, where
Task A involves classifying text as AI-generated or human-written, and Task B
identifies the specific LLM behind the text. The key innovation of our method
lies in the use of Chain-of-Thought reasoning, which enables the model to
generate explanations for its predictions, enhancing transparency and
interpretability. Our experiments demonstrate that COT Fine-tuned achieves high
accuracy in both tasks, with strong performance in LLM identification and
human-AI classification. We also show that the CoT reasoning process
contributes significantly to the models effectiveness and interpretability.


## AI 摘要

该论文提出了一种名为COT Fine-tuned的新型框架，用于检测AI生成的文本并识别生成文本的具体语言模型。该方法采用双任务设计：任务A区分AI生成与人类写作的文本，任务B识别生成文本的具体大语言模型。其创新点在于利用思维链推理技术，使模型能够为预测提供解释，从而提升透明度和可解释性。实验表明，该框架在两项任务中都表现出高准确率，尤其在模型识别和人机分类方面表现优异。研究还证实，思维链推理过程对提升模型效果和可解释性具有显著贡献。
