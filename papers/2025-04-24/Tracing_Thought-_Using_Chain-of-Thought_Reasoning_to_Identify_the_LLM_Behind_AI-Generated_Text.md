# Tracing Thought: Using Chain-of-Thought Reasoning to Identify the LLM Behind AI-Generated Text

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16913v1

## 原始摘要

In recent years, the detection of AI-generated text has become a critical
area of research due to concerns about academic integrity, misinformation, and
ethical AI deployment. This paper presents COT Fine-tuned, a novel framework
for detecting AI-generated text and identifying the specific language model.
responsible for generating the text. We propose a dual-task approach, where
Task A involves classifying text as AI-generated or human-written, and Task B
identifies the specific LLM behind the text. The key innovation of our method
lies in the use of Chain-of-Thought reasoning, which enables the model to
generate explanations for its predictions, enhancing transparency and
interpretability. Our experiments demonstrate that COT Fine-tuned achieves high
accuracy in both tasks, with strong performance in LLM identification and
human-AI classification. We also show that the CoT reasoning process
contributes significantly to the models effectiveness and interpretability.


## AI 摘要

近年来，AI生成文本的检测成为重要研究领域。本文提出COT Fine-tuned框架，采用双重任务方法：任务A区分AI生成与人类撰写文本，任务B识别生成文本的具体语言模型。该方法的创新点在于利用思维链推理（Chain-of-Thought），使模型能为其预测生成解释，提升透明度和可解释性。实验表明，COT Fine-tuned在两项任务中均表现优异，尤其在语言模型识别和人机分类方面准确率高。研究证实思维链推理显著提升了模型效果和可解释性。
