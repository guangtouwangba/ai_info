# Tracing Thought: Using Chain-of-Thought Reasoning to Identify the LLM Behind AI-Generated Text

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16913v1

## 原始摘要

In recent years, the detection of AI-generated text has become a critical
area of research due to concerns about academic integrity, misinformation, and
ethical AI deployment. This paper presents COT Fine-tuned, a novel framework
for detecting AI-generated text and identifying the specific language model.
responsible for generating the text. We propose a dual-task approach, where
Task A involves classifying text as AI-generated or human-written, and Task B
identifies the specific LLM behind the text. The key innovation of our method
lies in the use of Chain-of-Thought reasoning, which enables the model to
generate explanations for its predictions, enhancing transparency and
interpretability. Our experiments demonstrate that COT Fine-tuned achieves high
accuracy in both tasks, with strong performance in LLM identification and
human-AI classification. We also show that the CoT reasoning process
contributes significantly to the models effectiveness and interpretability.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种名为COT Fine-tuned的新型AI文本检测框架，通过双任务设计实现AI生成文本检测和特定语言模型识别。该框架创新性地采用思维链推理机制，使模型能为其预测提供解释，从而提升透明度和可解释性。实验表明，该方法在AI/人类文本分类和特定LLM识别任务中均表现优异，思维链推理对提升模型效果和可解释性起到关键作用。该研究对维护学术诚信、防范错误信息和促进AI伦理部署具有重要意义。
