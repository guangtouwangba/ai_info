# Building A Secure Agentic AI Application Leveraging A2A Protocol

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16902v1

## 原始摘要

As Agentic AI systems evolve from basic workflows to complex multi agent
collaboration, robust protocols such as Google's Agent2Agent (A2A) become
essential enablers. To foster secure adoption and ensure the reliability of
these complex interactions, understanding the secure implementation of A2A is
essential. This paper addresses this goal by providing a comprehensive security
analysis centered on the A2A protocol. We examine its fundamental elements and
operational dynamics, situating it within the framework of agent communication
development. Utilizing the MAESTRO framework, specifically designed for AI
risks, we apply proactive threat modeling to assess potential security issues
in A2A deployments, focusing on aspects such as Agent Card management, task
execution integrity, and authentication methodologies.
  Based on these insights, we recommend practical secure development
methodologies and architectural best practices designed to build resilient and
effective A2A systems. Our analysis also explores how the synergy between A2A
and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) can further enhance secure
interoperability. This paper equips developers and architects with the
knowledge and practical guidance needed to confidently leverage the A2A
protocol for building robust and secure next generation agentic applications.
