# A Survey on Mixup Augmentations and Beyond

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05202v2

## 原始摘要

As Deep Neural Networks have achieved thrilling breakthroughs in the past
decade, data augmentations have garnered increasing attention as regularization
techniques when massive labeled data are unavailable. Among existing
augmentations, Mixup and relevant data-mixing methods that convexly combine
selected samples and the corresponding labels are widely adopted because they
yield high performances by generating data-dependent virtual data while easily
migrating to various domains. This survey presents a comprehensive review of
foundational mixup methods and their applications. We first elaborate on the
training pipeline with mixup augmentations as a unified framework containing
modules. A reformulated framework could contain various mixup methods and give
intuitive operational procedures. Then, we systematically investigate the
applications of mixup augmentations on vision downstream tasks, various data
modalities, and some analysis \&amp; theorems of mixup. Meanwhile, we conclude the
current status and limitations of mixup research and point out further work for
effective and efficient mixup augmentations. This survey can provide
researchers with the current state of the art in mixup methods and provide some
insights and guidance roles in the mixup arena. An online project with this
survey is available at https://github.com/Westlake-AI/Awesome-Mixup.
