# A Measure Based Generalizable Approach to Understandability

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21615v2

## 原始摘要

Successful agent-human partnerships require that any agent generated
information is understandable to the human, and that the human can easily steer
the agent towards a goal. Such effective communication requires the agent to
develop a finer-level notion of what is understandable to the human.
State-of-the-art agents, including LLMs, lack this detailed notion of
understandability because they only capture average human sensibilities from
the training data, and therefore afford limited steerability (e.g., requiring
non-trivial prompt engineering).
  In this paper, instead of only relying on data, we argue for developing
generalizable, domain-agnostic measures of understandability that can be used
as directives for these agents. Existing research on understandability measures
is fragmented, we survey various such efforts across domains, and lay a
cognitive-science-rooted groundwork for more coherent and domain-agnostic
research investigations in future.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了构建高效人机协作的关键在于提升智能体生成信息的可理解性及人类对其的引导能力。现有智能体(如大语言模型)仅依赖训练数据中的平均人类认知水平，缺乏细粒度可理解性评估，导致引导性受限(如依赖复杂提示工程)。作者主张开发通用、领域无关的可理解性度量标准作为智能体指导原则，而非仅依赖数据驱动。通过跨领域综述现有研究，本文以认知科学为基础，为未来更系统、领域无关的可理解性研究奠定了基础，旨在促进人机间更有效的沟通协作。 (100字)
