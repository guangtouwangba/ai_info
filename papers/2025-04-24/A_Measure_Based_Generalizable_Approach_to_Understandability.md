# A Measure Based Generalizable Approach to Understandability

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21615v2

## 原始摘要

Successful agent-human partnerships require that any agent generated
information is understandable to the human, and that the human can easily steer
the agent towards a goal. Such effective communication requires the agent to
develop a finer-level notion of what is understandable to the human.
State-of-the-art agents, including LLMs, lack this detailed notion of
understandability because they only capture average human sensibilities from
the training data, and therefore afford limited steerability (e.g., requiring
non-trivial prompt engineering).
  In this paper, instead of only relying on data, we argue for developing
generalizable, domain-agnostic measures of understandability that can be used
as directives for these agents. Existing research on understandability measures
is fragmented, we survey various such efforts across domains, and lay a
cognitive-science-rooted groundwork for more coherent and domain-agnostic
research investigations in future.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了人机协作中智能体生成信息的可理解性问题。当前包括大语言模型在内的智能体仅依赖训练数据中的平均人类感知，缺乏对个体可理解性的精细把握，导致可操控性有限（如需要复杂提示工程）。作者主张开发通用、领域无关的可理解性度量标准作为智能体的指导原则，而非仅依赖数据。通过跨领域研究综述，本文整合了现有碎片化的可理解性测量方法，并基于认知科学为未来更统一、领域无关的研究奠定了基础，旨在提升人机协作中的信息传达效率和目标导向能力。（100字）
