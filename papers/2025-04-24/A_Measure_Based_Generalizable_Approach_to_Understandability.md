# A Measure Based Generalizable Approach to Understandability

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21615v2

## 原始摘要

Successful agent-human partnerships require that any agent generated
information is understandable to the human, and that the human can easily steer
the agent towards a goal. Such effective communication requires the agent to
develop a finer-level notion of what is understandable to the human.
State-of-the-art agents, including LLMs, lack this detailed notion of
understandability because they only capture average human sensibilities from
the training data, and therefore afford limited steerability (e.g., requiring
non-trivial prompt engineering).
  In this paper, instead of only relying on data, we argue for developing
generalizable, domain-agnostic measures of understandability that can be used
as directives for these agents. Existing research on understandability measures
is fragmented, we survey various such efforts across domains, and lay a
cognitive-science-rooted groundwork for more coherent and domain-agnostic
research investigations in future.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了提升人机协作效率的关键——智能体生成信息的可理解性。现有AI系统（包括大语言模型）仅依赖训练数据中的平均人类认知水平，缺乏细粒度可理解性评估，导致人机交互效率受限。作者主张开发通用、领域无关的可理解性度量标准，而非仅依赖数据驱动。通过梳理跨领域相关研究，本文为未来建立基于认知科学的统一、领域无关的可理解性研究框架奠定了基础，旨在使智能体更好地理解人类认知需求，降低交互门槛（如减少复杂提示工程需求），实现更高效的人机目标协同。
