# ARB: A Comprehensive Arabic Multimodal Reasoning Benchmark

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17021v1

## 原始摘要

As Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) become more capable, there is growing
interest in evaluating their reasoning processes alongside their final outputs.
However, most benchmarks remain focused on English, overlooking languages with
rich linguistic and cultural contexts, such as Arabic. To address this gap, we
introduce the Comprehensive Arabic Multimodal Reasoning Benchmark (ARB), the
first benchmark designed to evaluate step-by-step reasoning in Arabic across
both textual and visual modalities. ARB spans 11 diverse domains, including
visual reasoning, document understanding, OCR, scientific analysis, and
cultural interpretation. It comprises 1,356 multimodal samples paired with
5,119 human-curated reasoning steps and corresponding actions. We evaluated 12
state-of-the-art open- and closed-source LMMs and found persistent challenges
in coherence, faithfulness, and cultural grounding. ARB offers a structured
framework for diagnosing multimodal reasoning in underrepresented languages and
marks a critical step toward inclusive, transparent, and culturally aware AI
systems. We release the benchmark, rubric, and evaluation suit to support
future research and reproducibility. Code available at:

## AI 摘要

阿拉伯语多模态推理基准(ARB)是首个针对阿拉伯语多模态逐步推理能力的评估基准，涵盖视觉推理、文档理解、OCR、科学分析和文化解读等11个领域。该基准包含1,356个多模态样本及5,119个人工标注的推理步骤。通过对12个先进开源和闭源大模型的测试，发现这些模型在连贯性、忠实度和文化适应性方面仍存在挑战。ARB为评估非主流语言的多模态推理能力提供了结构化框架，推动了更具包容性、透明性和文化敏感性的AI系统发展。相关代码、评估标准和测试套件已开源，以支持后续研究。
