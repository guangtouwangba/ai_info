# ARB: A Comprehensive Arabic Multimodal Reasoning Benchmark

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17021v1

## 原始摘要

As Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) become more capable, there is growing
interest in evaluating their reasoning processes alongside their final outputs.
However, most benchmarks remain focused on English, overlooking languages with
rich linguistic and cultural contexts, such as Arabic. To address this gap, we
introduce the Comprehensive Arabic Multimodal Reasoning Benchmark (ARB), the
first benchmark designed to evaluate step-by-step reasoning in Arabic across
both textual and visual modalities. ARB spans 11 diverse domains, including
visual reasoning, document understanding, OCR, scientific analysis, and
cultural interpretation. It comprises 1,356 multimodal samples paired with
5,119 human-curated reasoning steps and corresponding actions. We evaluated 12
state-of-the-art open- and closed-source LMMs and found persistent challenges
in coherence, faithfulness, and cultural grounding. ARB offers a structured
framework for diagnosing multimodal reasoning in underrepresented languages and
marks a critical step toward inclusive, transparent, and culturally aware AI
systems. We release the benchmark, rubric, and evaluation suit to support
future research and reproducibility. Code available at:

## AI 摘要

这篇论文介绍了首个针对阿拉伯语的多模态推理基准测试ARB，旨在评估大型多模态模型(LMMs)在阿拉伯语文本和视觉模态中的逐步推理能力。ARB涵盖11个领域，包含1,356个多模态样本和5,119个人工标注的推理步骤。研究评估了12个先进的开源和闭源LMMs，发现这些模型在连贯性、忠实度和文化基础方面仍存在挑战。ARB为评估少数语言的多模态推理提供了结构化框架，推动了更具包容性、透明性和文化意识的AI系统发展。相关代码、基准和评估套件已开源。
