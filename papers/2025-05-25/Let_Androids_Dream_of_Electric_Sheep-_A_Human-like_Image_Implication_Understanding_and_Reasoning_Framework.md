# Let Androids Dream of Electric Sheep: A Human-like Image Implication Understanding and Reasoning Framework

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17019v1

## 原始摘要

Metaphorical comprehension in images remains a critical challenge for AI
systems, as existing models struggle to grasp the nuanced cultural, emotional,
and contextual implications embedded in visual content. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) excel in basic Visual Question Answer (VQA) tasks, they
struggle with a fundamental limitation on image implication tasks: contextual
gaps that obscure the relationships between different visual elements and their
abstract meanings. Inspired by the human cognitive process, we propose Let
Androids Dream (LAD), a novel framework for image implication understanding and
reasoning. LAD addresses contextual missing through the three-stage framework:
(1) Perception: converting visual information into rich and multi-level textual
representations, (2) Search: iteratively searching and integrating cross-domain
knowledge to resolve ambiguity, and (3) Reasoning: generating context-alignment
image implication via explicit reasoning. Our framework with the lightweight
GPT-4o-mini model achieves SOTA performance compared to 15+ MLLMs on English
image implication benchmark and a huge improvement on Chinese benchmark,
performing comparable with the GPT-4o model on Multiple-Choice Question (MCQ)
and outperforms 36.7% on Open-Style Question (OSQ). Additionally, our work
provides new insights into how AI can more effectively interpret image
implications, advancing the field of vision-language reasoning and human-AI
interaction. Our project is publicly available at

## AI 摘要

该研究提出了一种名为"Let Androids Dream (LAD)"的新型框架，用于解决AI系统在图像隐喻理解方面的关键挑战。LAD通过三阶段处理流程（感知-搜索-推理）模仿人类认知过程，将视觉信息转化为多层次文本表征，整合跨领域知识进行消歧，最终生成符合上下文的图像含义推理。实验表明，该框架配合轻量级GPT-4o-mini模型在英汉图像隐喻基准测试中表现优异，在多项选择题上与GPT-4o相当，在开放式问题上超出36.7%。这项工作为提升AI视觉语言推理能力提供了新思路。项目已开源。
