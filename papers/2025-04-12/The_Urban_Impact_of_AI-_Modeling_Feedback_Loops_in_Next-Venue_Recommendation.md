# The Urban Impact of AI: Modeling Feedback Loops in Next-Venue Recommendation

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07911v1

## 原始摘要

Next-venue recommender systems are increasingly embedded in location-based
services, shaping individual mobility decisions in urban environments. While
their predictive accuracy has been extensively studied, less attention has been
paid to their systemic impact on urban dynamics. In this work, we introduce a
simulation framework to model the human-AI feedback loop underpinning
next-venue recommendation, capturing how algorithmic suggestions influence
individual behavior, which in turn reshapes the data used to retrain the
models. Our simulations, grounded in real-world mobility data, systematically
explore the effects of algorithmic adoption across a range of recommendation
strategies. We find that while recommender systems consistently increase
individual-level diversity in visited venues, they may simultaneously amplify
collective inequality by concentrating visits on a limited subset of popular
places. This divergence extends to the structure of social co-location
networks, revealing broader implications for urban accessibility and spatial
segregation. Our framework operationalizes the feedback loop in next-venue
recommendation and offers a novel lens through which to assess the societal
impact of AI-assisted mobility-providing a computational tool to anticipate
future risks, evaluate regulatory interventions, and inform the design of ethic
algorithmic systems.


## AI 摘要

该研究提出了一个模拟框架，用于分析基于位置的"下一地点推荐系统"如何通过人机反馈循环影响城市动态。研究发现，虽然推荐算法能增加个人访问场所的多样性，但会加剧集体不平等——使访问集中在少数热门地点。这种影响还体现在社交共现网络结构中，可能加深城市空间隔离。该框架为评估AI辅助出行的社会影响提供了新工具，可帮助预测风险、评估监管措施，并指导伦理算法设计。研究基于真实出行数据，系统比较了不同推荐策略的效果，揭示了算法对城市可及性和空间分化的潜在影响。
