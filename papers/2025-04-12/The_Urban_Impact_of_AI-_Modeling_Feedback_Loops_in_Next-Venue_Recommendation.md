# The Urban Impact of AI: Modeling Feedback Loops in Next-Venue Recommendation

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07911v1

## 原始摘要

Next-venue recommender systems are increasingly embedded in location-based
services, shaping individual mobility decisions in urban environments. While
their predictive accuracy has been extensively studied, less attention has been
paid to their systemic impact on urban dynamics. In this work, we introduce a
simulation framework to model the human-AI feedback loop underpinning
next-venue recommendation, capturing how algorithmic suggestions influence
individual behavior, which in turn reshapes the data used to retrain the
models. Our simulations, grounded in real-world mobility data, systematically
explore the effects of algorithmic adoption across a range of recommendation
strategies. We find that while recommender systems consistently increase
individual-level diversity in visited venues, they may simultaneously amplify
collective inequality by concentrating visits on a limited subset of popular
places. This divergence extends to the structure of social co-location
networks, revealing broader implications for urban accessibility and spatial
segregation. Our framework operationalizes the feedback loop in next-venue
recommendation and offers a novel lens through which to assess the societal
impact of AI-assisted mobility-providing a computational tool to anticipate
future risks, evaluate regulatory interventions, and inform the design of ethic
algorithmic systems.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文提出了一个模拟框架，研究基于AI的下一地点推荐系统对城市动态的系统性影响。研究发现，虽然推荐系统能增加个人访问场所的多样性，但可能加剧集体不平等，使访问集中在少数热门地点。该框架通过真实移动数据模拟人机反馈循环，揭示推荐算法对城市可达性和空间隔离的潜在影响，为评估AI辅助移动的社会影响、预测风险、评估监管措施和设计伦理算法系统提供了计算工具。研究强调了在追求预测准确性的同时，需关注推荐系统对城市结构的长期影响。
