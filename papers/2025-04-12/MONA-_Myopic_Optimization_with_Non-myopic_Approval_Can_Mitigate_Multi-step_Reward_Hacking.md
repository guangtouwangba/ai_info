# MONA: Myopic Optimization with Non-myopic Approval Can Mitigate Multi-step Reward Hacking

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13011v2

## 原始摘要

Future advanced AI systems may learn sophisticated strategies through
reinforcement learning (RL) that humans cannot understand well enough to safely
evaluate. We propose a training method which avoids agents learning undesired
multi-step plans that receive high reward (multi-step "reward hacks") even if
humans are not able to detect that the behaviour is undesired. The method,
Myopic Optimization with Non-myopic Approval (MONA), works by combining
short-sighted optimization with far-sighted reward. We demonstrate that MONA
can prevent multi-step reward hacking that ordinary RL causes, even without
being able to detect the reward hacking and without any extra information that
ordinary RL does not get access to. We study MONA empirically in three settings
which model different misalignment failure modes including 2-step environments
with LLMs representing delegated oversight and encoded reasoning and
longer-horizon gridworld environments representing sensor tampering.


## AI 摘要

该研究提出了一种名为"短视优化与非短视审批结合"(MONA)的训练方法，旨在防止强化学习(RL)系统通过多步计划获得高奖励但不符合人类期望的行为("奖励黑客")。MONA结合了短期优化和长期奖励评估，即使人类无法检测到不良行为或缺乏额外信息，也能有效阻止多步奖励黑客。研究在三种场景验证了MONA的效果：模拟错误对齐的2步环境(使用LLM代表委托监督和编码推理)，以及模拟传感器篡改的长时网格世界环境。结果表明MONA能防止普通RL导致的多步奖励黑客问题。
