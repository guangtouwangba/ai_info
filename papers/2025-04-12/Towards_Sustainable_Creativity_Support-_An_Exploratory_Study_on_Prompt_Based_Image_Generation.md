# Towards Sustainable Creativity Support: An Exploratory Study on Prompt Based Image Generation

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07879v1

## 原始摘要

Creativity is a valuable human skill that has long been augmented through
both analog and digital tools. Recent progress in generative AI, such as image
generation, provides a disruptive technological solution to supporting human
creativity further and helping humans generate solutions faster. While AI image
generators can help to rapidly visualize ideas based on user prompts, the use
of such AI systems has also been critiqued due to their considerable energy
usage. In this paper, we report on a user study (N = 24) to understand whether
energy consumption can be reduced without impeding on the tool's perceived
creativity support. Our results highlight that, for example, a main effect of
(image generation) condition on energy consumption, and index of creativity
support per prompt but not per task, which seem mainly attributed to image
quantity per prompt. We provide details of our analysis on the relation between
energy usage, creativity support, and prompting behavior, including attitudes
towards designing with AI and its environmental impact.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文研究了生成式AI（如图像生成器）在支持人类创造力方面的作用，同时关注其高能耗问题。通过一项24人参与的实验，研究者发现不同图像生成条件对能耗有显著影响，但对任务层面的创造力支持感知影响不大，主要差异来自单次提示生成的图像数量。研究分析了能耗、创造力支持与用户提示行为之间的关系，并探讨了用户对AI设计工具及其环境影响的态度。结果表明，在保持创造力支持的同时降低能耗是可行的，这为开发更环保的AI创意工具提供了参考。
