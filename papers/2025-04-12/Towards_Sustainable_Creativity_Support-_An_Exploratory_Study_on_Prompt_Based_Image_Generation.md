# Towards Sustainable Creativity Support: An Exploratory Study on Prompt Based Image Generation

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07879v1

## 原始摘要

Creativity is a valuable human skill that has long been augmented through
both analog and digital tools. Recent progress in generative AI, such as image
generation, provides a disruptive technological solution to supporting human
creativity further and helping humans generate solutions faster. While AI image
generators can help to rapidly visualize ideas based on user prompts, the use
of such AI systems has also been critiqued due to their considerable energy
usage. In this paper, we report on a user study (N = 24) to understand whether
energy consumption can be reduced without impeding on the tool's perceived
creativity support. Our results highlight that, for example, a main effect of
(image generation) condition on energy consumption, and index of creativity
support per prompt but not per task, which seem mainly attributed to image
quantity per prompt. We provide details of our analysis on the relation between
energy usage, creativity support, and prompting behavior, including attitudes
towards designing with AI and its environmental impact.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文探讨了AI图像生成工具在支持人类创造力方面的作用，同时关注其高能耗问题。研究通过用户实验（N=24）分析是否能在不影响创意支持的前提下降低能耗。结果显示，图像生成条件显著影响能耗和单次提示的创意支持指数（而非整体任务），主要归因于每次提示生成的图像数量。研究还分析了能耗、创意支持和用户提示行为之间的关系，包括对AI设计及其环境影响的态度。结果表明，通过优化提示策略可能实现节能而不损害创意体验。
