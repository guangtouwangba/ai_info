## 原始摘要

Pumpkin leaf diseases are significant threats to agricultural productivity,
requiring a timely and precise diagnosis for effective management. Traditional
identification methods are laborious and susceptible to human error,
emphasizing the necessity for automated solutions. This study employs on the
"Pumpkin Leaf Disease Dataset", that comprises of 2000 high-resolution images
separated into five categories. Downy mildew, powdery mildew, mosaic disease,
bacterial leaf spot, and healthy leaves. The dataset was rigorously assembled
from several agricultural fields to ensure a strong representation for model
training. We explored many proficient deep learning architectures, including
DenseNet201, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, Xception, ResNet50, ResNet101 and
InceptionResNetV2, and observed that ResNet50 performed most effectively, with
an accuracy of 90.5% and comparable precision, recall, and F1-Score. We used
Explainable AI (XAI) approaches like Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, Score-CAM, and
Layer-CAM to provide meaningful representations of model decision-making
processes, which improved understanding and trust in automated disease
diagnostics. These findings demonstrate ResNet50's potential to revolutionize
pumpkin leaf disease detection, allowing for earlier and more accurate
treatments.


## AI 摘要

南瓜叶病害严重影响农业产量，传统人工检测效率低且易出错。本研究采用包含2000张高分辨率图像的南瓜叶病害数据集（5类：霜霉病、白粉病、花叶病、细菌性叶斑病及健康叶片），测试了多种深度学习模型。结果显示ResNet50表现最优，准确率达90.5%，其他指标（精确率、召回率、F1分数）均衡。通过Grad-CAM等可解释AI技术增强了模型决策的可信度。该研究证明ResNet50能有效实现南瓜叶病害的自动化精准检测，为早期防治提供可靠支持。（100字）
