# We Are All Creators: Generative AI, Collective Knowledge, and the Path Towards Human-AI Synergy

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07936v1

## 原始摘要

Generative AI presents a profound challenge to traditional notions of human
uniqueness, particularly in creativity. Fueled by neural network based
foundation models, these systems demonstrate remarkable content generation
capabilities, sparking intense debates about authorship, copyright, and
intelligence itself. This paper argues that generative AI represents an
alternative form of intelligence and creativity, operating through mathematical
pattern synthesis rather than biological understanding or verbatim replication.
The fundamental differences between artificial and biological neural networks
reveal AI learning as primarily statistical pattern extraction from vast
datasets crystallized forms of collective human knowledge scraped from the
internet. This perspective complicates copyright theft narratives and
highlights practical challenges in attributing AI outputs to individual
sources. Rather than pursuing potentially futile legal restrictions, we
advocate for human AI synergy. By embracing generative AI as a complementary
tool alongside human intuition, context, and ethical judgment, society can
unlock unprecedented innovation, democratize creative expression, and address
complex challenges. This collaborative approach, grounded in realistic
understanding of AIs capabilities and limitations, offers the most promising
path forward. Additionally, recognizing these models as products of collective
human knowledge raises ethical questions about accessibility ensuring equitable
access to these tools could prevent widening societal divides and leverage
their full potential for collective benefit.


## AI 摘要

生成式AI对人类独特性的传统观念构成挑战，尤其在创造力领域。基于神经网络的基础模型展现出强大的内容生成能力，引发关于著作权和智能本质的争论。论文认为生成式AI代表一种新型智能，通过数学模式合成而非生物理解来运作。其学习本质是从人类集体知识数据中提取统计模式，这使得版权归属复杂化。作者主张人机协同而非法律限制，将AI作为补充工具，结合人类直觉与伦理判断，以释放创新潜力。同时需关注这类集体知识产物的伦理问题，确保公平访问以避免社会分化。
