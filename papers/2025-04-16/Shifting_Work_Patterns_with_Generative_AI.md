# Shifting Work Patterns with Generative AI

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11436v1

## 原始摘要

We present evidence on how generative AI changes the work patterns of
knowledge workers using data from a 6-month-long, cross-industry, randomized
field experiment. Half of the 6,000 workers in the study received access to a
generative AI tool integrated into the applications they already used for
emails, document creation, and meetings. We find that access to the AI tool
during the first year of its release primarily impacted behaviors that could be
changed independently and not behaviors that required coordination to change:
workers who used the tool spent 3 fewer hours, or 25% less time on email each
week (intent to treat estimate is 1.4 hours) and seemed to complete documents
moderately faster, but did not significantly change time spent in meetings.


## AI 摘要

一项为期6个月、涵盖6,000名知识工作者的随机对照实验显示，生成式AI显著改变了工作模式。使用AI工具(集成在邮件、文档和会议应用中)的员工每周处理邮件时间减少3小时(降幅25%)，文档完成速度有所提升，但会议时间未明显变化。研究表明，AI初期主要影响可独立改变的行为，而非需要协调的行为。实验组实际使用者的效果(3小时)比意向治疗分析结果(1.4小时)更显著。这些发现揭示了AI工具在职场应用中的初期行为影响模式。
