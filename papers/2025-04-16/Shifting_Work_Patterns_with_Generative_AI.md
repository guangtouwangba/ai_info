# Shifting Work Patterns with Generative AI

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11436v1

## 原始摘要

We present evidence on how generative AI changes the work patterns of
knowledge workers using data from a 6-month-long, cross-industry, randomized
field experiment. Half of the 6,000 workers in the study received access to a
generative AI tool integrated into the applications they already used for
emails, document creation, and meetings. We find that access to the AI tool
during the first year of its release primarily impacted behaviors that could be
changed independently and not behaviors that required coordination to change:
workers who used the tool spent 3 fewer hours, or 25% less time on email each
week (intent to treat estimate is 1.4 hours) and seemed to complete documents
moderately faster, but did not significantly change time spent in meetings.


## AI 摘要

一项为期6个月的跨行业随机对照实验研究了生成式AI对6000名知识工作者工作模式的影响。研究发现，使用AI工具的员工每周处理邮件时间减少3小时（降幅25%），文档完成速度有所提升，但会议时间未显著变化。这表明AI初期主要影响可独立改变的行为，而非需要协调调整的工作环节。实验组通过现有办公软件集成AI功能，意向治疗效应为每周节省1.4小时。研究揭示了AI技术应用初期对工作流程的差异化影响特征。
