# Shifting Work Patterns with Generative AI

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11436v1

## 原始摘要

We present evidence on how generative AI changes the work patterns of
knowledge workers using data from a 6-month-long, cross-industry, randomized
field experiment. Half of the 6,000 workers in the study received access to a
generative AI tool integrated into the applications they already used for
emails, document creation, and meetings. We find that access to the AI tool
during the first year of its release primarily impacted behaviors that could be
changed independently and not behaviors that required coordination to change:
workers who used the tool spent 3 fewer hours, or 25% less time on email each
week (intent to treat estimate is 1.4 hours) and seemed to complete documents
moderately faster, but did not significantly change time spent in meetings.


## AI 摘要

一项为期6个月、涉及6,000名知识工作者的随机对照实验发现，使用生成式AI工具显著改变了工作模式。实验组员工通过现有办公软件使用AI后，每周处理邮件时间减少3小时(降幅25%)，文档完成速度也有所提升。但会议时间未显著变化，表明AI主要影响可独立调整的工作行为，而非需要协调的集体活动。研究揭示了AI在职场应用的初期效果边界。(99字)
