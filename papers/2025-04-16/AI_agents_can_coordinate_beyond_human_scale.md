# AI agents can coordinate beyond human scale

## 原始摘要

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in collaborative tasks
involving multiple agents, forming an "AI agent society: where agents interact
and influence one another. Whether such groups can spontaneously coordinate on
arbitrary decisions without external influence - a hallmark of self-organized
regulation in human societies - remains an open question. Here we investigate
the stability of groups formed by AI agents by applying methods from complexity
science and principles from behavioral sciences. We find that LLMs can
spontaneously form cohesive groups, and that their opinion dynamics is governed
by a majority force coefficient, which determines whether coordination is
achievable. This majority force diminishes as group size increases, leading to
a critical group size beyond which coordination becomes practically
unattainable and stability is lost. Notably, this critical group size grows
exponentially with the language capabilities of the models, and for the most
advanced LLMs, it exceeds the typical size of informal human groups. Our
findings highlight intrinsic limitations in the self-organization of AI agent
societies and have implications for the design of collaborative AI systems
where coordination is desired or could represent a treat.


## AI 摘要

大型语言模型（LLM）在协作任务中展现出类似人类社会的自组织能力。研究发现，LLM群体能自发形成凝聚力，其意见动态受"多数力系数"调控，该系数决定协调能否达成。随着群体规模增大，多数力减弱，导致超过临界规模后协调失效。值得注意的是，临界规模随模型语言能力呈指数增长，最先进LLM的临界规模甚至超过人类非正式群体。这一发现揭示了AI社会自组织的内在限制，对需要协调的协作AI系统设计具有重要启示，既可能促进合作，也可能带来潜在风险。（100字）
