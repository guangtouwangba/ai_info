# AI agents can coordinate beyond human scale

## 原始摘要

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in collaborative tasks
involving multiple agents, forming an "AI agent society: where agents interact
and influence one another. Whether such groups can spontaneously coordinate on
arbitrary decisions without external influence - a hallmark of self-organized
regulation in human societies - remains an open question. Here we investigate
the stability of groups formed by AI agents by applying methods from complexity
science and principles from behavioral sciences. We find that LLMs can
spontaneously form cohesive groups, and that their opinion dynamics is governed
by a majority force coefficient, which determines whether coordination is
achievable. This majority force diminishes as group size increases, leading to
a critical group size beyond which coordination becomes practically
unattainable and stability is lost. Notably, this critical group size grows
exponentially with the language capabilities of the models, and for the most
advanced LLMs, it exceeds the typical size of informal human groups. Our
findings highlight intrinsic limitations in the self-organization of AI agent
societies and have implications for the design of collaborative AI systems
where coordination is desired or could represent a treat.


## AI 摘要

研究发现，大型语言模型(LLM)组成的AI群体能自发形成凝聚力，其意见动态受"多数力量系数"支配。该系数决定协调可能性，但随着群体规模增大而减弱，存在一个临界规模，超过后协调将无法实现。值得注意的是，临界规模随模型语言能力呈指数增长，最先进LLM的临界规模甚至超过典型人类非正式群体规模。这揭示了AI社会自组织的内在局限性，对需要协调的协作AI系统设计具有重要启示。研究采用复杂性科学和行为科学方法，为理解AI群体稳定性提供了新视角。(99字)
