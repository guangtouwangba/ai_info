## 原始摘要

Advances in generative AI have rapidly expanded the potential of computers to
perform or assist in a wide array of tasks traditionally performed by humans.
We analyze a large, real-world randomized experiment of over 6,000 workers at
56 firms to present some of the earliest evidence on how these technologies are
changing the way knowledge workers do their jobs. We find substantial time
savings on common core tasks across a wide range of industries and occupations:
workers who make use of this technology spent half an hour less reading email
each week and completed documents 12% faster. Despite the newness of the
technology, nearly 40% of workers who were given access to the tool used it
regularly in their work throughout the 6-month study.


## AI 摘要

一项针对6,000多名知识工作者的实验研究表明，生成式AI显著提升了工作效率。实验显示，使用AI工具的工人每周阅读邮件时间减少半小时，文档处理速度提升12%。该技术已广泛应用于多个行业，在6个月研究期间，近40%的受试者持续使用AI辅助工作。这些发现为生成式AI如何改变传统工作方式提供了早期实证依据，证实其能有效节省时间并提高任务完成效率。
