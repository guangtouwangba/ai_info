## 原始摘要

Advances in generative AI have rapidly expanded the potential of computers to
perform or assist in a wide array of tasks traditionally performed by humans.
We analyze a large, real-world randomized experiment of over 6,000 workers at
56 firms to present some of the earliest evidence on how these technologies are
changing the way knowledge workers do their jobs. We find substantial time
savings on common core tasks across a wide range of industries and occupations:
workers who make use of this technology spent half an hour less reading email
each week and completed documents 12% faster. Despite the newness of the
technology, nearly 40% of workers who were given access to the tool used it
regularly in their work throughout the 6-month study.


## AI 摘要

一项针对6,000多名知识工作者的实验研究表明，生成式AI显著提升了工作效率。在为期6个月的研究中，使用AI工具的工人每周节省约30分钟阅读邮件时间，文档处理速度提升12%。该技术在各行业和岗位都展现出显著的时间节省效果。值得注意的是，尽管技术较新，约40%的受试者在研究期间持续使用该工具。这些发现为生成式AI如何改变知识工作方式提供了早期实证依据，显示出该技术在实际工作场景中的广泛应用潜力和接受度。
