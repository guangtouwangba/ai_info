## 原始摘要

Advances in generative AI have rapidly expanded the potential of computers to
perform or assist in a wide array of tasks traditionally performed by humans.
We analyze a large, real-world randomized experiment of over 6,000 workers at
56 firms to present some of the earliest evidence on how these technologies are
changing the way knowledge workers do their jobs. We find substantial time
savings on common core tasks across a wide range of industries and occupations:
workers who make use of this technology spent half an hour less reading email
each week and completed documents 12% faster. Despite the newness of the
technology, nearly 40% of workers who were given access to the tool used it
regularly in their work throughout the 6-month study.


## AI 摘要

一项针对56家公司的6000多名知识工作者的实验研究显示，生成式AI能显著提高工作效率。使用该技术的员工每周处理邮件时间减少半小时，文档完成速度提升12%。尽管技术较新，约40%的员工在6个月研究中持续使用该工具。研究表明，AI正在改变各行业知识工作者的工作方式，带来实质性时间节省。
