## 原始摘要

Advances in generative AI have rapidly expanded the potential of computers to
perform or assist in a wide array of tasks traditionally performed by humans.
We analyze a large, real-world randomized experiment of over 6,000 workers at
56 firms to present some of the earliest evidence on how these technologies are
changing the way knowledge workers do their jobs. We find substantial time
savings on common core tasks across a wide range of industries and occupations:
workers who make use of this technology spent half an hour less reading email
each week and completed documents 12% faster. Despite the newness of the
technology, nearly 40% of workers who were given access to the tool used it
regularly in their work throughout the 6-month study.


## AI 摘要

一项针对6,000多名知识工作者的实验研究表明，生成式AI显著提升了工作效率。数据显示，使用该技术的员工每周处理邮件时间减少半小时，文档完成速度提升12%。尽管技术较新，在6个月的研究期内仍有近40%的受试者持续使用该工具。这些发现证实了AI在各类行业和岗位中节省时间的潜力，展现了新技术如何改变传统工作方式。研究为生成式AI在实际工作场景中的应用效果提供了早期实证依据。
