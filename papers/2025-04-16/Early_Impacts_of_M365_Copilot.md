## 原始摘要

Advances in generative AI have rapidly expanded the potential of computers to
perform or assist in a wide array of tasks traditionally performed by humans.
We analyze a large, real-world randomized experiment of over 6,000 workers at
56 firms to present some of the earliest evidence on how these technologies are
changing the way knowledge workers do their jobs. We find substantial time
savings on common core tasks across a wide range of industries and occupations:
workers who make use of this technology spent half an hour less reading email
each week and completed documents 12% faster. Despite the newness of the
technology, nearly 40% of workers who were given access to the tool used it
regularly in their work throughout the 6-month study.


## AI 摘要

这项研究分析了6,000多名知识工作者使用生成式AI的真实实验数据，发现AI能显著提升工作效率。使用AI的员工每周阅读邮件时间减少半小时，文档处理速度提升12%。尽管技术较新，约40%的员工在6个月研究中持续使用该工具。结果表明，生成式AI正在改变知识工作者的工作方式，能节省时间并提高生产力，且在各行业和岗位中都有广泛应用潜力。
