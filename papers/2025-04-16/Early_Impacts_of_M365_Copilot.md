## 原始摘要

Advances in generative AI have rapidly expanded the potential of computers to
perform or assist in a wide array of tasks traditionally performed by humans.
We analyze a large, real-world randomized experiment of over 6,000 workers at
56 firms to present some of the earliest evidence on how these technologies are
changing the way knowledge workers do their jobs. We find substantial time
savings on common core tasks across a wide range of industries and occupations:
workers who make use of this technology spent half an hour less reading email
each week and completed documents 12% faster. Despite the newness of the
technology, nearly 40% of workers who were given access to the tool used it
regularly in their work throughout the 6-month study.


## AI 摘要

一项针对56家公司6000多名员工的大规模实验研究表明，生成式AI显著提升了知识工作者的效率。数据显示，使用该技术的员工每周阅读邮件时间减少半小时，文档处理速度提升12%。尽管技术较新，但在6个月的研究期内，近40%的员工持续使用该工具。这些发现揭示了AI在广泛行业和职业中节省时间、提高生产力的潜力。
