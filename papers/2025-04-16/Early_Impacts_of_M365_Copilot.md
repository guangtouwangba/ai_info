## 原始摘要

Advances in generative AI have rapidly expanded the potential of computers to
perform or assist in a wide array of tasks traditionally performed by humans.
We analyze a large, real-world randomized experiment of over 6,000 workers at
56 firms to present some of the earliest evidence on how these technologies are
changing the way knowledge workers do their jobs. We find substantial time
savings on common core tasks across a wide range of industries and occupations:
workers who make use of this technology spent half an hour less reading email
each week and completed documents 12% faster. Despite the newness of the
technology, nearly 40% of workers who were given access to the tool used it
regularly in their work throughout the 6-month study.


## AI 摘要

一项针对6,000多名知识工作者的实验研究发现，生成式AI能显著提升工作效率。研究显示，使用该技术的员工每周阅读邮件时间减少半小时，文档处理速度提升12%。尽管技术较新，在6个月的研究期内仍有近40%的员工持续使用该工具。这些发现表明，AI正在广泛改变各行业知识工作者的工作方式，带来实质性的时间节省和效率提升。
