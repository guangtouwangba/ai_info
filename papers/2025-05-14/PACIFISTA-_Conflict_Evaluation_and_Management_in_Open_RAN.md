# PACIFISTA: Conflict Evaluation and Management in Open RAN

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04395v4

## 原始摘要

The O-RAN ALLIANCE is defining architectures, interfaces, operations, and
security requirements for cellular networks based on Open Radio Access Network
(RAN) principles. In this context, O-RAN introduced the RAN Intelligent
Controllers (RICs) to enable dynamic control of cellular networks via
data-driven applications referred to as rApps and xApps. RICs enable for the
first time truly intelligent and self-organizing cellular networks. However,
enabling the execution of many Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms making
autonomous control decisions to fulfill diverse (and possibly conflicting)
goals poses unprecedented challenges. For instance, the execution of one xApp
aiming at maximizing throughput and one aiming at minimizing energy consumption
would inevitably result in diametrically opposed resource allocation
strategies. Therefore, conflict management becomes a crucial component of any
functional intelligent O-RAN system. This article studies the problem of
conflict mitigation in O-RAN and proposes PACIFISTA, a framework to detect,
characterize, and mitigate conflicts generated by O-RAN applications that
control RAN parameters. PACIFISTA leverages a profiling pipeline to tests O-RAN
applications in a sandbox environment, and combines hierarchical graphs with
statistical models to detect the existence of conflicts and evaluate their
severity. Experiments on Colosseum and OpenRAN Gym demonstrate PACIFISTA's
ability to predict conflicts and provide valuable information before
conflicting xApps are deployed on production. We demonstrate that users can
experience a 16% throughput loss even in the case of xApps with similar goals,
and that applications with conflicting goals might cause instability and result
in up to 30% performance degradation. We also show that PACIFISTA can help
operators to identify conflicting applications and maintain performance
degradation at bay.


## AI 摘要

O-RAN联盟基于开放无线接入网（O-RAN）原则定义了蜂窝网络的架构、接口和安全性要求，并引入无线智能控制器（RIC）通过rApps/xApps实现数据驱动的动态控制。然而，多个AI应用的自主决策可能导致目标冲突（如吞吐量最大化与能耗最小化）。为此，研究者提出PACIFISTA框架，通过沙盒测试和分层图统计模型检测并缓解冲突。实验表明，目标相似的xApp仍会导致16%吞吐量损失，冲突目标更可能引发30%性能下降。该框架能帮助运营商在部署前识别冲突，维持网络性能。
