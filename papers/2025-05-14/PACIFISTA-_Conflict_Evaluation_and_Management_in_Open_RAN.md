# PACIFISTA: Conflict Evaluation and Management in Open RAN

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04395v4

## 原始摘要

The O-RAN ALLIANCE is defining architectures, interfaces, operations, and
security requirements for cellular networks based on Open Radio Access Network
(RAN) principles. In this context, O-RAN introduced the RAN Intelligent
Controllers (RICs) to enable dynamic control of cellular networks via
data-driven applications referred to as rApps and xApps. RICs enable for the
first time truly intelligent and self-organizing cellular networks. However,
enabling the execution of many Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms making
autonomous control decisions to fulfill diverse (and possibly conflicting)
goals poses unprecedented challenges. For instance, the execution of one xApp
aiming at maximizing throughput and one aiming at minimizing energy consumption
would inevitably result in diametrically opposed resource allocation
strategies. Therefore, conflict management becomes a crucial component of any
functional intelligent O-RAN system. This article studies the problem of
conflict mitigation in O-RAN and proposes PACIFISTA, a framework to detect,
characterize, and mitigate conflicts generated by O-RAN applications that
control RAN parameters. PACIFISTA leverages a profiling pipeline to tests O-RAN
applications in a sandbox environment, and combines hierarchical graphs with
statistical models to detect the existence of conflicts and evaluate their
severity. Experiments on Colosseum and OpenRAN Gym demonstrate PACIFISTA's
ability to predict conflicts and provide valuable information before
conflicting xApps are deployed on production. We demonstrate that users can
experience a 16% throughput loss even in the case of xApps with similar goals,
and that applications with conflicting goals might cause instability and result
in up to 30% performance degradation. We also show that PACIFISTA can help
operators to identify conflicting applications and maintain performance
degradation at bay.


## AI 摘要

O-RAN联盟基于开放无线接入网络(O-RAN)原则定义了蜂窝网络的架构、接口和安全性要求，并引入了无线智能控制器(RIC)通过rApps和xApps实现数据驱动的网络动态控制。然而，多个AI应用可能产生目标冲突(如吞吐量最大化与能耗最小化)，导致性能下降。为此，研究者提出PACIFISTA框架，通过在沙盒环境中测试应用，结合分层图和统计模型来检测和缓解冲突。实验表明，该框架能有效预测冲突，避免部署后出现高达30%的性能损失，帮助运营商识别冲突应用并控制性能下降。
