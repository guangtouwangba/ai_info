# PACIFISTA: Conflict Evaluation and Management in Open RAN

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04395v4

## 原始摘要

The O-RAN ALLIANCE is defining architectures, interfaces, operations, and
security requirements for cellular networks based on Open Radio Access Network
(RAN) principles. In this context, O-RAN introduced the RAN Intelligent
Controllers (RICs) to enable dynamic control of cellular networks via
data-driven applications referred to as rApps and xApps. RICs enable for the
first time truly intelligent and self-organizing cellular networks. However,
enabling the execution of many Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms making
autonomous control decisions to fulfill diverse (and possibly conflicting)
goals poses unprecedented challenges. For instance, the execution of one xApp
aiming at maximizing throughput and one aiming at minimizing energy consumption
would inevitably result in diametrically opposed resource allocation
strategies. Therefore, conflict management becomes a crucial component of any
functional intelligent O-RAN system. This article studies the problem of
conflict mitigation in O-RAN and proposes PACIFISTA, a framework to detect,
characterize, and mitigate conflicts generated by O-RAN applications that
control RAN parameters. PACIFISTA leverages a profiling pipeline to tests O-RAN
applications in a sandbox environment, and combines hierarchical graphs with
statistical models to detect the existence of conflicts and evaluate their
severity. Experiments on Colosseum and OpenRAN Gym demonstrate PACIFISTA's
ability to predict conflicts and provide valuable information before
conflicting xApps are deployed on production. We demonstrate that users can
experience a 16% throughput loss even in the case of xApps with similar goals,
and that applications with conflicting goals might cause instability and result
in up to 30% performance degradation. We also show that PACIFISTA can help
operators to identify conflicting applications and maintain performance
degradation at bay.


## AI 摘要

O-RAN联盟引入RAN智能控制器(RIC)支持通过rApps/xApps实现蜂窝网络智能控制，但多AI应用的自主决策可能引发目标冲突（如吞吐量最大化与能耗最小化）。为此，研究提出PACIFISTA框架，通过沙盒测试和分层图统计模型来检测、评估冲突严重性。实验显示：目标相似的xApp仍会导致16%吞吐量损失，冲突目标应用更可能引发30%性能下降。该框架能在部署前预测冲突，帮助运营商维持网络性能。研究成果验证了冲突管理在智能O-RAN系统中的关键作用。
