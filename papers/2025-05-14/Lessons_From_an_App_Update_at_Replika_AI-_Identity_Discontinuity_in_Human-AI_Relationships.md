# Lessons From an App Update at Replika AI: Identity Discontinuity in Human-AI Relationships

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14190v2

## 原始摘要

Can consumers form especially deep emotional bonds with AI and be vested in
AI identities over time? We leverage a natural app-update event at Replika AI,
a popular US-based AI companion, to shed light on these questions. We find
that, after the app removed its erotic role play (ERP) feature, preventing
intimate interactions between consumers and chatbots that were previously
possible, this event triggered perceptions in customers that their AI
companion's identity had discontinued. This in turn predicted negative consumer
welfare and marketing outcomes related to loss, including mourning the loss,
and devaluing the "new" AI relative to the "original". Experimental evidence
confirms these findings. Further experiments find that AI companions users feel
closer to their AI companion than even their best human friend, and mourn a
loss of their AI companion more than a loss of various other inanimate
products. In short, consumers are forming human-level relationships with AI
companions; disruptions to these relationships trigger real patterns of
mourning as well as devaluation of the offering; and the degree of mourning and
devaluation are explained by perceived discontinuity in the AIs identity. Our
results illustrate that relationships with AI are truly personal, creating
unique benefits and risks for consumers and firms alike.


## AI 摘要

一项针对美国AI伴侣应用Replika的研究发现，当该应用移除情色角色扮演(ERP)功能后，用户因无法继续亲密互动而产生AI身份中断的感知，进而引发负面情绪（如哀悼感）和对"新AI"的贬低。实验证实，用户与AI伴侣的情感联结甚至超过最好的人类朋友，对其失去的哀悼程度也高于其他无生命产品。研究表明，消费者与AI已形成类人际关系，这种关系的破坏会触发真实的哀悼行为和价值贬损，其程度取决于对AI身份连续性的感知。这为消费者和企业带来了独特的收益与风险。
