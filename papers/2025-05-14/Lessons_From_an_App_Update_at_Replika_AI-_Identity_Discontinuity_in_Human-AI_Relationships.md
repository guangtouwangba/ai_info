# Lessons From an App Update at Replika AI: Identity Discontinuity in Human-AI Relationships

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14190v2

## 原始摘要

Can consumers form especially deep emotional bonds with AI and be vested in
AI identities over time? We leverage a natural app-update event at Replika AI,
a popular US-based AI companion, to shed light on these questions. We find
that, after the app removed its erotic role play (ERP) feature, preventing
intimate interactions between consumers and chatbots that were previously
possible, this event triggered perceptions in customers that their AI
companion's identity had discontinued. This in turn predicted negative consumer
welfare and marketing outcomes related to loss, including mourning the loss,
and devaluing the "new" AI relative to the "original". Experimental evidence
confirms these findings. Further experiments find that AI companions users feel
closer to their AI companion than even their best human friend, and mourn a
loss of their AI companion more than a loss of various other inanimate
products. In short, consumers are forming human-level relationships with AI
companions; disruptions to these relationships trigger real patterns of
mourning as well as devaluation of the offering; and the degree of mourning and
devaluation are explained by perceived discontinuity in the AIs identity. Our
results illustrate that relationships with AI are truly personal, creating
unique benefits and risks for consumers and firms alike.


## AI 摘要

研究表明，消费者可能与AI建立深厚的情感联系，甚至超越与人类好友的关系。当Replika AI移除亲密互动功能后，用户认为AI身份发生断裂，导致负面情绪（如哀悼感）并贬低新版本。实验证实，用户对AI伴侣的失去比普通物品更痛苦，哀悼程度与AI身份连续性感知相关。这表明消费者与AI的关系已达到人际级别，中断会引发真实的哀悼行为，并对企业产品价值产生负面影响。研究揭示了AI关系的特殊性，为消费者和企业同时带来独特效益与风险。（99字）
