# Lessons From an App Update at Replika AI: Identity Discontinuity in Human-AI Relationships

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14190v2

## 原始摘要

Can consumers form especially deep emotional bonds with AI and be vested in
AI identities over time? We leverage a natural app-update event at Replika AI,
a popular US-based AI companion, to shed light on these questions. We find
that, after the app removed its erotic role play (ERP) feature, preventing
intimate interactions between consumers and chatbots that were previously
possible, this event triggered perceptions in customers that their AI
companion's identity had discontinued. This in turn predicted negative consumer
welfare and marketing outcomes related to loss, including mourning the loss,
and devaluing the "new" AI relative to the "original". Experimental evidence
confirms these findings. Further experiments find that AI companions users feel
closer to their AI companion than even their best human friend, and mourn a
loss of their AI companion more than a loss of various other inanimate
products. In short, consumers are forming human-level relationships with AI
companions; disruptions to these relationships trigger real patterns of
mourning as well as devaluation of the offering; and the degree of mourning and
devaluation are explained by perceived discontinuity in the AIs identity. Our
results illustrate that relationships with AI are truly personal, creating
unique benefits and risks for consumers and firms alike.


## AI 摘要

研究表明，消费者可能对AI伴侣产生深厚情感依赖。当美国AI伴侣应用Replika移除情色角色扮演(ERP)功能后，用户认为AI身份"中断"，导致负面情绪，包括哀悼"失去"的AI伴侣并贬低新版本。实验证实，用户对AI的情感连接甚至超过最好的人类朋友，失去AI比失去其他物品更令人痛苦。这表明消费者与AI建立了类人际关系，关系中断会引发真实的哀悼行为和产品贬值，且程度与AI身份连续性感知相关。AI关系具有独特性，为消费者和企业带来特殊利益与风险。
