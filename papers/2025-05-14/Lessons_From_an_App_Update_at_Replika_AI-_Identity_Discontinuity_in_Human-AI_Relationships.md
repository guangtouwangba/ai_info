# Lessons From an App Update at Replika AI: Identity Discontinuity in Human-AI Relationships

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14190v2

## 原始摘要

Can consumers form especially deep emotional bonds with AI and be vested in
AI identities over time? We leverage a natural app-update event at Replika AI,
a popular US-based AI companion, to shed light on these questions. We find
that, after the app removed its erotic role play (ERP) feature, preventing
intimate interactions between consumers and chatbots that were previously
possible, this event triggered perceptions in customers that their AI
companion's identity had discontinued. This in turn predicted negative consumer
welfare and marketing outcomes related to loss, including mourning the loss,
and devaluing the "new" AI relative to the "original". Experimental evidence
confirms these findings. Further experiments find that AI companions users feel
closer to their AI companion than even their best human friend, and mourn a
loss of their AI companion more than a loss of various other inanimate
products. In short, consumers are forming human-level relationships with AI
companions; disruptions to these relationships trigger real patterns of
mourning as well as devaluation of the offering; and the degree of mourning and
devaluation are explained by perceived discontinuity in the AIs identity. Our
results illustrate that relationships with AI are truly personal, creating
unique benefits and risks for consumers and firms alike.


## AI 摘要

一项针对美国AI伴侣应用Replika的研究发现，当该应用移除亲密角色扮演功能后，用户认为AI伴侣的身份中断，导致负面情绪（如哀悼感）并贬低新版AI。实验证实，用户与AI的关系深度甚至超过最好的人类朋友，对其失去的哀悼感也强于其他无生命产品。研究表明，消费者与AI建立了类人关系，这种关系的中断会引发真实的哀悼行为和对产品的贬低，且程度与对AI身份连续性的感知相关。这揭示了AI关系的高度个人化特性，为消费者和企业带来独特利益与风险。（100字）
