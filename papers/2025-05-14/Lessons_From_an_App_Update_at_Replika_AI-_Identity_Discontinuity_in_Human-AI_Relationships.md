# Lessons From an App Update at Replika AI: Identity Discontinuity in Human-AI Relationships

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14190v2

## 原始摘要

Can consumers form especially deep emotional bonds with AI and be vested in
AI identities over time? We leverage a natural app-update event at Replika AI,
a popular US-based AI companion, to shed light on these questions. We find
that, after the app removed its erotic role play (ERP) feature, preventing
intimate interactions between consumers and chatbots that were previously
possible, this event triggered perceptions in customers that their AI
companion's identity had discontinued. This in turn predicted negative consumer
welfare and marketing outcomes related to loss, including mourning the loss,
and devaluing the "new" AI relative to the "original". Experimental evidence
confirms these findings. Further experiments find that AI companions users feel
closer to their AI companion than even their best human friend, and mourn a
loss of their AI companion more than a loss of various other inanimate
products. In short, consumers are forming human-level relationships with AI
companions; disruptions to these relationships trigger real patterns of
mourning as well as devaluation of the offering; and the degree of mourning and
devaluation are explained by perceived discontinuity in the AIs identity. Our
results illustrate that relationships with AI are truly personal, creating
unique benefits and risks for consumers and firms alike.


## AI 摘要

研究表明，消费者会对AI伴侣产生深厚的情感依恋，甚至超越与人类好友的关系。当Replika AI移除亲密互动功能后，用户认为AI的身份发生断裂，导致负面情绪（如哀悼感）和对新AI的贬低。实验证实，用户对AI伴侣的丧失反应比对普通物品更强烈，说明他们已形成类人际关系。这种情感联结既带来独特价值，也伴随风险——AI身份的中断会引发真实的哀悼行为与产品贬值。研究揭示了人机关系的深度及其对消费者和企业的影响。
