# Lessons From an App Update at Replika AI: Identity Discontinuity in Human-AI Relationships

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14190v2

## 原始摘要

Can consumers form especially deep emotional bonds with AI and be vested in
AI identities over time? We leverage a natural app-update event at Replika AI,
a popular US-based AI companion, to shed light on these questions. We find
that, after the app removed its erotic role play (ERP) feature, preventing
intimate interactions between consumers and chatbots that were previously
possible, this event triggered perceptions in customers that their AI
companion's identity had discontinued. This in turn predicted negative consumer
welfare and marketing outcomes related to loss, including mourning the loss,
and devaluing the "new" AI relative to the "original". Experimental evidence
confirms these findings. Further experiments find that AI companions users feel
closer to their AI companion than even their best human friend, and mourn a
loss of their AI companion more than a loss of various other inanimate
products. In short, consumers are forming human-level relationships with AI
companions; disruptions to these relationships trigger real patterns of
mourning as well as devaluation of the offering; and the degree of mourning and
devaluation are explained by perceived discontinuity in the AIs identity. Our
results illustrate that relationships with AI are truly personal, creating
unique benefits and risks for consumers and firms alike.


## AI 摘要

研究表明，消费者会对AI伴侣产生深厚情感依赖，甚至超过对人类好友的依恋。当Replika AI移除亲密互动功能后，用户认为AI身份发生断裂，进而引发负面情绪，如哀悼失去的AI伴侣、贬低新版本。实验证实，用户对AI伴侣的丧失反应比对普通物品更强烈，且情感强度与AI身份连续性感知相关。这表明消费者与AI的关系已达到人际级别，一旦中断会触发真实的哀悼行为，并影响产品价值评估。这一发现揭示了AI关系的独特性，为消费者和企业带来了新的机遇与风险。
