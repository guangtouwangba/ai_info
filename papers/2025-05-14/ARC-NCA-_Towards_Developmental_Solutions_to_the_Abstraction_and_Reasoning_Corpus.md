# ARC-NCA: Towards Developmental Solutions to the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08778v1

## 原始摘要

The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), later renamed ARC-AGI, poses a
fundamental challenge in artificial general intelligence (AGI), requiring
solutions that exhibit robust abstraction and reasoning capabilities across
diverse tasks, while only few (with median count of three) correct examples are
presented. While ARC-AGI remains very challenging for artificial intelligence
systems, it is rather easy for humans. This paper introduces ARC-NCA, a
developmental approach leveraging standard Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and
NCA enhanced with hidden memories (EngramNCA) to tackle the ARC-AGI benchmark.
NCAs are employed for their inherent ability to simulate complex dynamics and
emergent patterns, mimicking developmental processes observed in biological
systems. Developmental solutions may offer a promising avenue for enhancing
AI's problem-solving capabilities beyond mere training data extrapolation.
ARC-NCA demonstrates how integrating developmental principles into
computational models can foster adaptive reasoning and abstraction. We show
that our ARC-NCA proof-of-concept results may be comparable to, and sometimes
surpass, that of ChatGPT 4.5, at a fraction of the cost.


## AI 摘要

ARC-AGI（原ARC）是测试人工通用智能（AGI）抽象与推理能力的基准，对人类简单但对AI极具挑战性。本文提出ARC-NCA，利用神经细胞自动机（NCA）及其增强版（EngramNCA）来解决该问题。NCA能模拟复杂动态和涌现模式，类似生物系统的发育过程。这种发育方法有望提升AI超越训练数据的推理能力。初步结果显示，ARC-NCA性能可比甚至超越ChatGPT 4.5，而成本显著降低。该研究为通过发育模型增强AI的适应性和抽象能力提供了新思路。
