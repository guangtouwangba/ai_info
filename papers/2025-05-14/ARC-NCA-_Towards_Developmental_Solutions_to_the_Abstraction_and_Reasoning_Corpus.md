# ARC-NCA: Towards Developmental Solutions to the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08778v1

## 原始摘要

The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), later renamed ARC-AGI, poses a
fundamental challenge in artificial general intelligence (AGI), requiring
solutions that exhibit robust abstraction and reasoning capabilities across
diverse tasks, while only few (with median count of three) correct examples are
presented. While ARC-AGI remains very challenging for artificial intelligence
systems, it is rather easy for humans. This paper introduces ARC-NCA, a
developmental approach leveraging standard Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and
NCA enhanced with hidden memories (EngramNCA) to tackle the ARC-AGI benchmark.
NCAs are employed for their inherent ability to simulate complex dynamics and
emergent patterns, mimicking developmental processes observed in biological
systems. Developmental solutions may offer a promising avenue for enhancing
AI's problem-solving capabilities beyond mere training data extrapolation.
ARC-NCA demonstrates how integrating developmental principles into
computational models can foster adaptive reasoning and abstraction. We show
that our ARC-NCA proof-of-concept results may be comparable to, and sometimes
surpass, that of ChatGPT 4.5, at a fraction of the cost.


## AI 摘要

本文提出ARC-NCA方法，利用神经细胞自动机(NCA)和带隐藏记忆的EngramNCA来解决ARC-AGI基准测试难题。ARC-AGI需要强大的抽象推理能力，对人类简单但对AI极具挑战。NCA能模拟生物系统的复杂动态和涌现模式，通过发育式方法增强AI的问题解决能力，而不仅依赖训练数据外推。研究表明，ARC-NCA的概念验证结果可与ChatGPT 4.5相媲美甚至更优，且成本显著降低。该方法展示了将发育原理融入计算模型如何促进自适应推理和抽象能力的发展。
