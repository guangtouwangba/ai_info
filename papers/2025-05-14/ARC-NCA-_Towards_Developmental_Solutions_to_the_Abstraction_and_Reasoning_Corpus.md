# ARC-NCA: Towards Developmental Solutions to the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08778v1

## 原始摘要

The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), later renamed ARC-AGI, poses a
fundamental challenge in artificial general intelligence (AGI), requiring
solutions that exhibit robust abstraction and reasoning capabilities across
diverse tasks, while only few (with median count of three) correct examples are
presented. While ARC-AGI remains very challenging for artificial intelligence
systems, it is rather easy for humans. This paper introduces ARC-NCA, a
developmental approach leveraging standard Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and
NCA enhanced with hidden memories (EngramNCA) to tackle the ARC-AGI benchmark.
NCAs are employed for their inherent ability to simulate complex dynamics and
emergent patterns, mimicking developmental processes observed in biological
systems. Developmental solutions may offer a promising avenue for enhancing
AI's problem-solving capabilities beyond mere training data extrapolation.
ARC-NCA demonstrates how integrating developmental principles into
computational models can foster adaptive reasoning and abstraction. We show
that our ARC-NCA proof-of-concept results may be comparable to, and sometimes
surpass, that of ChatGPT 4.5, at a fraction of the cost.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文介绍了ARC-NCA，一种基于神经细胞自动机（NCA）及其增强版本（EngramNCA）的开发式方法，用于解决ARC-AGI基准测试问题。ARC-AGI对人工智能系统极具挑战性，但对人类相对简单。NCA因其模拟复杂动态和涌现模式的能力被采用，可模仿生物系统的发育过程。这种开发式方法有望提升AI在有限示例下的问题解决能力。研究表明，ARC-NCA的概念验证结果可能媲美甚至超越ChatGPT 4.5，而成本显著更低。该方法展示了将发育原理融入计算模型如何促进自适应推理和抽象能力。
