# ARC-NCA: Towards Developmental Solutions to the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08778v1

## 原始摘要

The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), later renamed ARC-AGI, poses a
fundamental challenge in artificial general intelligence (AGI), requiring
solutions that exhibit robust abstraction and reasoning capabilities across
diverse tasks, while only few (with median count of three) correct examples are
presented. While ARC-AGI remains very challenging for artificial intelligence
systems, it is rather easy for humans. This paper introduces ARC-NCA, a
developmental approach leveraging standard Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and
NCA enhanced with hidden memories (EngramNCA) to tackle the ARC-AGI benchmark.
NCAs are employed for their inherent ability to simulate complex dynamics and
emergent patterns, mimicking developmental processes observed in biological
systems. Developmental solutions may offer a promising avenue for enhancing
AI's problem-solving capabilities beyond mere training data extrapolation.
ARC-NCA demonstrates how integrating developmental principles into
computational models can foster adaptive reasoning and abstraction. We show
that our ARC-NCA proof-of-concept results may be comparable to, and sometimes
surpass, that of ChatGPT 4.5, at a fraction of the cost.


## AI 摘要

本文介绍了ARC-NCA，一种基于神经细胞自动机（NCA）和增强型记忆NCA（EngramNCA）的发育式方法，用于解决ARC-AGI基准测试的挑战。ARC-AGI要求AI系统仅通过少量示例展现强大的抽象和推理能力，对人类简单但对AI极具挑战。NCA因其模拟复杂动态和涌现模式的能力被采用，模仿生物系统的发育过程。研究表明，ARC-NCA在概念验证中的表现可能媲美甚至超越ChatGPT 4.5，且成本大幅降低，为增强AI的问题解决能力提供了新思路。
