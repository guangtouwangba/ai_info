# ARC-NCA: Towards Developmental Solutions to the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08778v1

## 原始摘要

The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), later renamed ARC-AGI, poses a
fundamental challenge in artificial general intelligence (AGI), requiring
solutions that exhibit robust abstraction and reasoning capabilities across
diverse tasks, while only few (with median count of three) correct examples are
presented. While ARC-AGI remains very challenging for artificial intelligence
systems, it is rather easy for humans. This paper introduces ARC-NCA, a
developmental approach leveraging standard Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and
NCA enhanced with hidden memories (EngramNCA) to tackle the ARC-AGI benchmark.
NCAs are employed for their inherent ability to simulate complex dynamics and
emergent patterns, mimicking developmental processes observed in biological
systems. Developmental solutions may offer a promising avenue for enhancing
AI's problem-solving capabilities beyond mere training data extrapolation.
ARC-NCA demonstrates how integrating developmental principles into
computational models can foster adaptive reasoning and abstraction. We show
that our ARC-NCA proof-of-concept results may be comparable to, and sometimes
surpass, that of ChatGPT 4.5, at a fraction of the cost.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文介绍了ARC-NCA，一种利用神经细胞自动机（NCA）和带隐藏记忆的增强版NCA（EngramNCA）来解决ARC-AGI基准测试的发育方法。ARC-AGI对AI系统极具挑战性，但对人类相对简单。NCA因其模拟复杂动态和涌现模式的能力而被采用，可模仿生物系统的发育过程。研究表明，这种发育方法可能超越单纯的数据外推，提升AI的问题解决能力。初步结果显示，ARC-NCA的表现与ChatGPT 4.5相当甚至更好，而成本却低得多。这为增强AI的抽象和推理能力提供了新思路。
