# AI Hiring with LLMs: A Context-Aware and Explainable Multi-Agent Framework for Resume Screening

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02870v2

## 原始摘要

Resume screening is a critical yet time-intensive process in talent
acquisition, requiring recruiters to analyze vast volume of job applications
while remaining objective, accurate, and fair. With the advancements in Large
Language Models (LLMs), their reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge
bases demonstrate new opportunities to streamline and automate recruitment
workflows. In this work, we propose a multi-agent framework for resume
screening using LLMs to systematically process and evaluate resumes. The
framework consists of four core agents, including a resume extractor, an
evaluator, a summarizer, and a score formatter. To enhance the contextual
relevance of candidate assessments, we integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) within the resume evaluator, allowing incorporation of external knowledge
sources, such as industry-specific expertise, professional certifications,
university rankings, and company-specific hiring criteria. This dynamic
adaptation enables personalized recruitment, bridging the gap between AI
automation and talent acquisition. We assess the effectiveness of our approach
by comparing AI-generated scores with ratings provided by HR professionals on a
dataset of anonymized online resumes. The findings highlight the potential of
multi-agent RAG-LLM systems in automating resume screening, enabling more
efficient and scalable hiring workflows.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种基于大语言模型(LLM)的多智能体框架，用于自动化简历筛选流程。该框架包含四个核心代理：简历提取器、评估器、总结器和评分格式化器。通过集成检索增强生成(RAG)技术，评估器可以整合行业专业知识、专业认证等外部知识，实现个性化招聘。研究通过比较AI评分与HR专业评分的匿名简历数据集，验证了该方法的有效性。结果表明，这种多智能体RAG-LLM系统能够提高招聘效率，在保持客观公正的同时，显著减少简历筛选的时间成本，为人才招聘工作流程提供了可扩展的自动化解决方案。
