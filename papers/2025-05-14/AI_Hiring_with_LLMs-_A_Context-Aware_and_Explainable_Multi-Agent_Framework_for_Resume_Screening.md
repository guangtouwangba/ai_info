# AI Hiring with LLMs: A Context-Aware and Explainable Multi-Agent Framework for Resume Screening

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02870v2

## 原始摘要

Resume screening is a critical yet time-intensive process in talent
acquisition, requiring recruiters to analyze vast volume of job applications
while remaining objective, accurate, and fair. With the advancements in Large
Language Models (LLMs), their reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge
bases demonstrate new opportunities to streamline and automate recruitment
workflows. In this work, we propose a multi-agent framework for resume
screening using LLMs to systematically process and evaluate resumes. The
framework consists of four core agents, including a resume extractor, an
evaluator, a summarizer, and a score formatter. To enhance the contextual
relevance of candidate assessments, we integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) within the resume evaluator, allowing incorporation of external knowledge
sources, such as industry-specific expertise, professional certifications,
university rankings, and company-specific hiring criteria. This dynamic
adaptation enables personalized recruitment, bridging the gap between AI
automation and talent acquisition. We assess the effectiveness of our approach
by comparing AI-generated scores with ratings provided by HR professionals on a
dataset of anonymized online resumes. The findings highlight the potential of
multi-agent RAG-LLM systems in automating resume screening, enabling more
efficient and scalable hiring workflows.


## AI 摘要

简历筛选是人才招聘中关键但耗时的环节。本研究提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的多智能体框架，通过四个核心模块（简历提取器、评估器、总结器和分数格式化器）实现简历自动化处理。创新性地采用检索增强生成（RAG）技术，整合行业知识、专业认证等外部信息，提升评估的上下文相关性。实验通过对比AI评分与HR专家评分验证了该框架的有效性。研究表明，这种多智能体RAG-LLM系统能显著提高招聘效率，在保持客观公正的同时实现规模化筛选，为智能化人才选拔提供了新思路。（100字）
