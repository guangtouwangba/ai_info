# AI Hiring with LLMs: A Context-Aware and Explainable Multi-Agent Framework for Resume Screening

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02870v2

## 原始摘要

Resume screening is a critical yet time-intensive process in talent
acquisition, requiring recruiters to analyze vast volume of job applications
while remaining objective, accurate, and fair. With the advancements in Large
Language Models (LLMs), their reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge
bases demonstrate new opportunities to streamline and automate recruitment
workflows. In this work, we propose a multi-agent framework for resume
screening using LLMs to systematically process and evaluate resumes. The
framework consists of four core agents, including a resume extractor, an
evaluator, a summarizer, and a score formatter. To enhance the contextual
relevance of candidate assessments, we integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) within the resume evaluator, allowing incorporation of external knowledge
sources, such as industry-specific expertise, professional certifications,
university rankings, and company-specific hiring criteria. This dynamic
adaptation enables personalized recruitment, bridging the gap between AI
automation and talent acquisition. We assess the effectiveness of our approach
by comparing AI-generated scores with ratings provided by HR professionals on a
dataset of anonymized online resumes. The findings highlight the potential of
multi-agent RAG-LLM systems in automating resume screening, enabling more
efficient and scalable hiring workflows.


## AI 摘要

简历筛选是人才招聘中关键但耗时的环节。本研究提出一个基于大语言模型(LLM)的多智能体框架来自动化这一流程，包含简历提取器、评估器、摘要生成器和分数格式化器四个核心组件。特别地，评估器采用检索增强生成(RAG)技术整合外部知识(如行业标准、专业认证等)，实现个性化评估。通过与HR专家评分的对比实验表明，该框架能有效提升筛选效率和准确性，为规模化招聘提供可行方案。研究展示了多智能体RAG-LLM系统在简历自动化处理方面的潜力，有望弥合AI自动化与人才招聘之间的鸿沟。(99字)
