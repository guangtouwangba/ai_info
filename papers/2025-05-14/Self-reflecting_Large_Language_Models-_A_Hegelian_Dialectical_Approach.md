# Self-reflecting Large Language Models: A Hegelian Dialectical Approach

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14917v5

## 原始摘要

Investigating NLP through a philosophical lens has recently caught
researcher's eyes as it connects computational methods with classical schools
of philosophy. This paper introduces a philosophical approach inspired by the
\textit{Hegelian Dialectic} for LLMs' \textit{self-reflection}, utilizing a
self-dialectical approach to emulate internal critiques and then synthesize new
ideas by resolving the opposing points of view. Moreover, this paper
investigates the effect of LLMs' temperature for generation by establishing a
dynamic annealing approach, which promotes the creativity in the early stages
and gradually refines it by focusing on the nuances, as well as a
fixed-temperature strategy for generation. We assess the effectiveness of our
proposed method in generating novel ideas and in improving the reasoning
abilities of LLMs during problem-solving. Moreover, we implement a Multi-Agent
Majority Voting (MAMV) strategy to assess the validity and novelty of the
generated ideas, which proves useful in the absence of domain experts. Our
experiments demonstrate promising results in generating ideas and enhancing
problem-solving performance.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文提出了一种受黑格尔辩证法启发的哲学方法，用于提升大语言模型(LLMs)的自我反思能力。通过自我辩证的方式模拟内部批判，并综合对立观点产生新想法。研究还探讨了温度参数对生成效果的影响，提出了动态退火策略（早期促进创造性，后期关注细节）和固定温度策略。通过多智能体多数投票(MAMV)方法评估生成想法的有效性和新颖性。实验结果表明，该方法在激发创意和提升问题解决能力方面取得了良好效果，特别是在缺乏领域专家时提供了有效评估方案。
