# Structured dataset of reported cloud seeding activities in the United States (2000 to 2025) using a large language model

## 原始摘要

Cloud seeding, a weather modification technique used to increase
precipitation, has been employed in the western United States since the 1940s.
However, structured datasets are not currently available to analyze these
efforts. To address this gap, we present a structured dataset of reported cloud
seeding activities in the U.S. from 2000 to 2025, including the year, season,
state, seeding agent, apparatus used for deployment, and purpose. Using
OpenAI's o4-mini large language model (LLM), combined with multi-stage
PDF-to-text conversion and response-parsing code, we processed 836 historical
reports from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to
extract the data. The resulting dataset achieved 94.72% human-verified accuracy
across all fields and is publicly available on Zenodo. Our results help fill
the gap in structured cloud seeding data and demonstrate the potential for LLMs
to extract structured environmental data from historical documents. More
broadly, this work provides a scalable framework for unlocking historical data
from scanned documents across scientific domains.


## AI 摘要

本文介绍了一个填补美国人工降雨（云催化）活动结构化数据空白的项目。研究者使用OpenAI的o4-mini大型语言模型，结合多阶段PDF文本转换和解析代码，处理了美国国家海洋和大气管理局（NOAA）836份历史报告，提取了2000-2025年间人工降雨活动的年份、季节、州、催化剂、投放装置和目的等数据。最终数据集在Zenodo平台公开，所有字段经人工验证准确率达94.72%。该研究不仅提供了结构化云催化数据，还展示了LLM从历史文档提取环境数据的潜力，为跨学科历史数据挖掘提供了可扩展框架。
