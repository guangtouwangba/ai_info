# Structured dataset of reported cloud seeding activities in the United States (2000 to 2025) using a large language model

## 原始摘要

Cloud seeding, a weather modification technique used to increase
precipitation, has been employed in the western United States since the 1940s.
However, structured datasets are not currently available to analyze these
efforts. To address this gap, we present a structured dataset of reported cloud
seeding activities in the U.S. from 2000 to 2025, including the year, season,
state, seeding agent, apparatus used for deployment, and purpose. Using
OpenAI's o4-mini large language model (LLM), combined with multi-stage
PDF-to-text conversion and response-parsing code, we processed 836 historical
reports from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to
extract the data. The resulting dataset achieved 94.72% human-verified accuracy
across all fields and is publicly available on Zenodo. Our results help fill
the gap in structured cloud seeding data and demonstrate the potential for LLMs
to extract structured environmental data from historical documents. More
broadly, this work provides a scalable framework for unlocking historical data
from scanned documents across scientific domains.


## AI 摘要

本文介绍了一个填补美国人工降雨(云催化)活动结构化数据空白的项目。研究者使用OpenAI的o4-mini大语言模型，结合多阶段PDF文本转换和响应解析代码，处理了836份NOAA历史报告，构建了2000-2025年美国人工降雨活动的结构化数据集，包含年份、季节、州、催化剂、部署装置和目的等信息。该数据集经人工验证准确率达94.72%，已在Zenodo平台公开。这项工作不仅填补了人工降雨数据空白，还展示了LLM从历史文档中提取结构化环境数据的潜力，为科学领域解锁扫描文档中的历史数据提供了可扩展框架。
