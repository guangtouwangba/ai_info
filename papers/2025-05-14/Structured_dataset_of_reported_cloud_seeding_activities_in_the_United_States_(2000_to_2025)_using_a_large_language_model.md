## 原始摘要

Cloud seeding, a weather modification technique used to increase
precipitation, has been employed in the western United States since the 1940s.
However, structured datasets are not currently available to analyze these
efforts. To address this gap, we present a structured dataset of reported cloud
seeding activities in the U.S. from 2000 to 2025, including the year, season,
state, seeding agent, apparatus used for deployment, and purpose. Using
OpenAI's o4-mini large language model (LLM), combined with multi-stage
PDF-to-text conversion and response-parsing code, we processed 836 historical
reports from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to
extract the data. The resulting dataset achieved 94.72% human-verified accuracy
across all fields and is publicly available on Zenodo. Our results help fill
the gap in structured cloud seeding data and demonstrate the potential for LLMs
to extract structured environmental data from historical documents. More
broadly, this work provides a scalable framework for unlocking historical data
from scanned documents across scientific domains.


## AI 摘要

美国自20世纪40年代起使用人工增雨技术（云催化），但缺乏结构化数据记录。为此，研究者通过处理836份NOAA历史报告，构建了2000-2025年美国云催化活动数据集，包含时间、地点、催化剂、设备及目的等信息。采用OpenAI的o4-mini大语言模型结合多阶段PDF文本转换技术，数据提取准确率达94.72%，成果已公开于Zenodo平台。该研究不仅填补了云催化结构化数据空白，更展示了LLM从历史文献提取环境数据的潜力，为跨学科历史文档数据挖掘提供了可扩展框架。（100字）
