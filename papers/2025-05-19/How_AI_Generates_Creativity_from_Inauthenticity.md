# How AI Generates Creativity from Inauthenticity

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11463v1

## 原始摘要

Artificial creativity is presented as a counter to Benjamin's conception of
an "aura" in art. Where Benjamin sees authenticity as art's critical element,
generative artificial intelligence operates as pure inauthenticity. Two
elements of purely inauthentic art are described: elusiveness and reflection.
Elusiveness is the inability to find an origin-story for the created artwork,
and reflection is the ability for perceivers to impose any origin that serves
their own purposes. The paper subsequently argues that these elements widen the
scope of artistic and creative potential. To illustrate, an example is
developed around musical improvisation with an artificial intelligence partner.
Finally, a question is raised about whether the inauthentic creativity of AI in
art can be extended to human experience and our sense of our identities.


## AI 摘要

该论文探讨了人工智能艺术创作对传统艺术"灵光"概念的挑战。作者指出，AI生成艺术具有纯粹非真实性特征，表现为两种特质：难以追溯创作起源的"模糊性"和允许观者自行赋予意义的"可投射性"。这些特质反而拓展了艺术创作的潜力，文中以AI音乐即兴创作为例说明。最后，作者提出思考：AI的非真实性创作是否会影响人类对自身身份和体验的认知。论文挑战了本雅明将真实性视为艺术核心要素的观点，认为AI艺术通过其非真实性特质开辟了新的创作可能性。
