# How AI Generates Creativity from Inauthenticity

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11463v1

## 原始摘要

Artificial creativity is presented as a counter to Benjamin's conception of
an "aura" in art. Where Benjamin sees authenticity as art's critical element,
generative artificial intelligence operates as pure inauthenticity. Two
elements of purely inauthentic art are described: elusiveness and reflection.
Elusiveness is the inability to find an origin-story for the created artwork,
and reflection is the ability for perceivers to impose any origin that serves
their own purposes. The paper subsequently argues that these elements widen the
scope of artistic and creative potential. To illustrate, an example is
developed around musical improvisation with an artificial intelligence partner.
Finally, a question is raised about whether the inauthentic creativity of AI in
art can be extended to human experience and our sense of our identities.


## AI 摘要

该摘要探讨人工智能艺术创作如何挑战本雅明提出的艺术"灵光"概念。作者指出，生成式AI创造的是纯粹非本真性艺术，具有两个特征：一是"不可追溯性"（作品缺乏明确的创作源头），二是"可投射性"（观赏者可任意赋予作品创作背景）。论文认为这些特性反而拓展了艺术创作的可能性，并以AI音乐即兴创作为例说明。最后提出思考：AI这种非本真的创造力是否会影响人类对自身身份和经验的认知。（99字）
