# How AI Generates Creativity from Inauthenticity

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11463v1

## 原始摘要

Artificial creativity is presented as a counter to Benjamin's conception of
an "aura" in art. Where Benjamin sees authenticity as art's critical element,
generative artificial intelligence operates as pure inauthenticity. Two
elements of purely inauthentic art are described: elusiveness and reflection.
Elusiveness is the inability to find an origin-story for the created artwork,
and reflection is the ability for perceivers to impose any origin that serves
their own purposes. The paper subsequently argues that these elements widen the
scope of artistic and creative potential. To illustrate, an example is
developed around musical improvisation with an artificial intelligence partner.
Finally, a question is raised about whether the inauthentic creativity of AI in
art can be extended to human experience and our sense of our identities.


## AI 摘要

该论文探讨了人工智能创造性与本雅明"灵光"艺术观的对比。作者指出，AI生成艺术具有"纯粹非真实性"的两个特征：难以追溯创作起源（模糊性）和允许观者自行赋予创作意图（投射性）。通过AI音乐即兴创作的案例，论文论证这些特征反而拓展了艺术创造力边界。最后，作者提出延伸思考：AI的非真实性创作是否会影响人类对自我身份的认知体验。全文挑战了传统艺术真实性的价值标准，展现了人工智能为艺术创作带来的新可能性。（99字）
