# How AI Generates Creativity from Inauthenticity

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11463v1

## 原始摘要

Artificial creativity is presented as a counter to Benjamin's conception of
an "aura" in art. Where Benjamin sees authenticity as art's critical element,
generative artificial intelligence operates as pure inauthenticity. Two
elements of purely inauthentic art are described: elusiveness and reflection.
Elusiveness is the inability to find an origin-story for the created artwork,
and reflection is the ability for perceivers to impose any origin that serves
their own purposes. The paper subsequently argues that these elements widen the
scope of artistic and creative potential. To illustrate, an example is
developed around musical improvisation with an artificial intelligence partner.
Finally, a question is raised about whether the inauthentic creativity of AI in
art can be extended to human experience and our sense of our identities.


## AI 摘要

该论文提出"人工创造力"作为对本雅明艺术"灵光"概念的反驳。作者认为，本雅明强调的艺术真实性在生成式AI创作中体现为纯粹的"非真实性"，其两大特征为：难以追溯创作源头的"模糊性"和观者可任意赋予创作意义的"映射性"。通过AI音乐即兴创作的案例，论文论证这些特性反而拓展了艺术创造力边界。最后，作者探讨AI的非真实创造力是否可延伸至人类经验与身份认知领域。全文挑战传统艺术真实性的核心地位，为AI艺术创作提供了新的理论视角。（99字）
