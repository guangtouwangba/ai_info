# How AI Generates Creativity from Inauthenticity

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11463v1

## 原始摘要

Artificial creativity is presented as a counter to Benjamin's conception of
an "aura" in art. Where Benjamin sees authenticity as art's critical element,
generative artificial intelligence operates as pure inauthenticity. Two
elements of purely inauthentic art are described: elusiveness and reflection.
Elusiveness is the inability to find an origin-story for the created artwork,
and reflection is the ability for perceivers to impose any origin that serves
their own purposes. The paper subsequently argues that these elements widen the
scope of artistic and creative potential. To illustrate, an example is
developed around musical improvisation with an artificial intelligence partner.
Finally, a question is raised about whether the inauthentic creativity of AI in
art can be extended to human experience and our sense of our identities.


## AI 摘要

该论文提出"人工创造力"作为对本雅明艺术"灵韵"概念的反驳。作者认为，本雅明强调艺术真实性的核心价值，而生成式AI艺术本质上是"纯粹非真实性"的创作。这种非真实性体现为两个特征：难以追溯作品起源的"模糊性"，以及观者可自行赋予作品意义的"投射性"。文章论证这些特性反而拓展了艺术创作的可能性，并以AI音乐即兴创作为例说明。最后，作者探讨这种非真实性创作是否可能延伸到人类对自我身份的认知层面。（99字）
