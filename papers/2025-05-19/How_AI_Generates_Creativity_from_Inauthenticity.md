# How AI Generates Creativity from Inauthenticity

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11463v1

## 原始摘要

Artificial creativity is presented as a counter to Benjamin's conception of
an "aura" in art. Where Benjamin sees authenticity as art's critical element,
generative artificial intelligence operates as pure inauthenticity. Two
elements of purely inauthentic art are described: elusiveness and reflection.
Elusiveness is the inability to find an origin-story for the created artwork,
and reflection is the ability for perceivers to impose any origin that serves
their own purposes. The paper subsequently argues that these elements widen the
scope of artistic and creative potential. To illustrate, an example is
developed around musical improvisation with an artificial intelligence partner.
Finally, a question is raised about whether the inauthentic creativity of AI in
art can be extended to human experience and our sense of our identities.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了人工智能艺术创作对传统艺术"灵光"概念的挑战。与强调真实性的传统艺术不同，生成式AI创造的是纯粹非真实的艺术，具有两个特征：难以追溯创作源头（难以捉摸性）和允许观者自行赋予创作意图（反射性）。作者认为这些特性拓展了艺术创作的潜力，并以AI音乐即兴创作为例说明。最后提出思考：AI的非真实创造力是否会影响人类对自我身份的认知。
