# How AI Generates Creativity from Inauthenticity

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11463v1

## 原始摘要

Artificial creativity is presented as a counter to Benjamin's conception of
an "aura" in art. Where Benjamin sees authenticity as art's critical element,
generative artificial intelligence operates as pure inauthenticity. Two
elements of purely inauthentic art are described: elusiveness and reflection.
Elusiveness is the inability to find an origin-story for the created artwork,
and reflection is the ability for perceivers to impose any origin that serves
their own purposes. The paper subsequently argues that these elements widen the
scope of artistic and creative potential. To illustrate, an example is
developed around musical improvisation with an artificial intelligence partner.
Finally, a question is raised about whether the inauthentic creativity of AI in
art can be extended to human experience and our sense of our identities.


## AI 摘要

该论文探讨了人工智能艺术创作对传统艺术"灵光"概念的挑战。文章指出，AI生成艺术具有两种非真实性特质：一是"不可追溯性"（无法追溯创作源头），二是"可投射性"（观者可自行赋予作品任何创作意图）。这些特质反而拓展了艺术创作的潜力，并以AI音乐即兴创作为例说明。最后，文章提出思考：AI艺术的这种非真实创造性是否会影响人类对自身身份认同的认知。论文认为，AI艺术以其纯粹的"非真实性"颠覆了本雅明强调的艺术"真实性"这一核心要素。
