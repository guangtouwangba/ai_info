# How AI Generates Creativity from Inauthenticity

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11463v1

## 原始摘要

Artificial creativity is presented as a counter to Benjamin's conception of
an "aura" in art. Where Benjamin sees authenticity as art's critical element,
generative artificial intelligence operates as pure inauthenticity. Two
elements of purely inauthentic art are described: elusiveness and reflection.
Elusiveness is the inability to find an origin-story for the created artwork,
and reflection is the ability for perceivers to impose any origin that serves
their own purposes. The paper subsequently argues that these elements widen the
scope of artistic and creative potential. To illustrate, an example is
developed around musical improvisation with an artificial intelligence partner.
Finally, a question is raised about whether the inauthentic creativity of AI in
art can be extended to human experience and our sense of our identities.


## AI 摘要

该论文探讨了人工智能艺术创作对传统艺术"灵光"概念的挑战。作者指出，AI生成艺术具有纯粹非真实性特征，表现为两方面：一是"不可追溯性"（无法追溯作品起源），二是"投射性"（观者可自行赋予作品意义）。这种特性反而拓展了艺术创作的潜力。文中以AI音乐即兴创作为例进行说明，并引发思考：AI的非真实创造力是否会影响人类对自身身份认同的认知。论文突破了本雅明关于艺术真实性的理论框架，为数字时代的艺术本质提供了新视角。（99字）
