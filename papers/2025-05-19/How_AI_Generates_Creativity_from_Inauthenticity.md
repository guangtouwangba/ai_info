# How AI Generates Creativity from Inauthenticity

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11463v1

## 原始摘要

Artificial creativity is presented as a counter to Benjamin's conception of
an "aura" in art. Where Benjamin sees authenticity as art's critical element,
generative artificial intelligence operates as pure inauthenticity. Two
elements of purely inauthentic art are described: elusiveness and reflection.
Elusiveness is the inability to find an origin-story for the created artwork,
and reflection is the ability for perceivers to impose any origin that serves
their own purposes. The paper subsequently argues that these elements widen the
scope of artistic and creative potential. To illustrate, an example is
developed around musical improvisation with an artificial intelligence partner.
Finally, a question is raised about whether the inauthentic creativity of AI in
art can be extended to human experience and our sense of our identities.


## AI 摘要

该论文探讨了人工智能创造力如何挑战本雅明提出的艺术"灵光"概念。与传统艺术强调真实性不同，生成式AI创造的艺术具有纯粹的非真实性特征，表现为两种特质：难以追溯创作起源的"难以捉摸性"，以及允许观者自行赋予创作意图的"可投射性"。作者认为这些特质反而拓展了艺术创作的可能性，并以AI音乐即兴创作为例说明。最后，文章提出思考：AI艺术中的非真实性创造力是否也能延伸至人类对自我身份的认知体验。全文探讨了AI如何重新定义艺术创作的本质和边界。
