# How AI Generates Creativity from Inauthenticity

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11463v1

## 原始摘要

Artificial creativity is presented as a counter to Benjamin's conception of
an "aura" in art. Where Benjamin sees authenticity as art's critical element,
generative artificial intelligence operates as pure inauthenticity. Two
elements of purely inauthentic art are described: elusiveness and reflection.
Elusiveness is the inability to find an origin-story for the created artwork,
and reflection is the ability for perceivers to impose any origin that serves
their own purposes. The paper subsequently argues that these elements widen the
scope of artistic and creative potential. To illustrate, an example is
developed around musical improvisation with an artificial intelligence partner.
Finally, a question is raised about whether the inauthentic creativity of AI in
art can be extended to human experience and our sense of our identities.


## AI 摘要

该论文探讨了人工智能创造力对艺术"灵光"概念的挑战。与瓦尔特·本雅明强调艺术真实性的观点相反，生成式AI创造的艺术具有纯粹非真实的特性，表现为两个特征：不可追溯性（作品无明确起源）和可投射性（观者可任意解读创作来源）。作者认为这些特性反而拓展了艺术创作的可能性，并以AI音乐即兴创作为例说明。最后，文章提出思考：AI艺术中的非真实创造力是否会影响人类对自我身份的认知。全文探讨了AI如何重新定义艺术的真实性与创作本质。（99字）
