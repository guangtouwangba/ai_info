# How AI Generates Creativity from Inauthenticity

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11463v1

## 原始摘要

Artificial creativity is presented as a counter to Benjamin's conception of
an "aura" in art. Where Benjamin sees authenticity as art's critical element,
generative artificial intelligence operates as pure inauthenticity. Two
elements of purely inauthentic art are described: elusiveness and reflection.
Elusiveness is the inability to find an origin-story for the created artwork,
and reflection is the ability for perceivers to impose any origin that serves
their own purposes. The paper subsequently argues that these elements widen the
scope of artistic and creative potential. To illustrate, an example is
developed around musical improvisation with an artificial intelligence partner.
Finally, a question is raised about whether the inauthentic creativity of AI in
art can be extended to human experience and our sense of our identities.


## AI 摘要

该摘要探讨了人工智能艺术与瓦尔特·本雅明"灵光"概念的对比。文章指出，生成式AI创造的是纯粹"非本真"的艺术，具有两个特征：难以追溯创作源头（模糊性）和允许观者自行赋予创作意图（投射性）。作者认为这些特性反而拓展了艺术创作的可能性，并以AI音乐即兴创作为例说明。最后提出了一个延伸问题：AI艺术的这种非本真性能否延伸到人类经验与身份认知领域。全文挑战了传统艺术真实性的价值，突出了AI创作的新维度。（99字）
