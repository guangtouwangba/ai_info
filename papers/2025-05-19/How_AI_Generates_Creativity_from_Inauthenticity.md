# How AI Generates Creativity from Inauthenticity

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11463v1

## 原始摘要

Artificial creativity is presented as a counter to Benjamin's conception of
an "aura" in art. Where Benjamin sees authenticity as art's critical element,
generative artificial intelligence operates as pure inauthenticity. Two
elements of purely inauthentic art are described: elusiveness and reflection.
Elusiveness is the inability to find an origin-story for the created artwork,
and reflection is the ability for perceivers to impose any origin that serves
their own purposes. The paper subsequently argues that these elements widen the
scope of artistic and creative potential. To illustrate, an example is
developed around musical improvisation with an artificial intelligence partner.
Finally, a question is raised about whether the inauthentic creativity of AI in
art can be extended to human experience and our sense of our identities.


## AI 摘要

该论文探讨了人工智能艺术对传统艺术"灵光"概念的挑战。与强调真实性的传统艺术不同，生成式AI艺术具有纯粹非真实的特性，表现为两种特质：难以追溯创作来源的"难以捉摸性"和允许观者自行解读的"可投射性"。作者认为这些特质拓展了艺术创作的潜力，并以AI音乐即兴创作为例进行说明。最后，论文提出思考：AI艺术的非真实性特质是否也能延伸到人类对自我身份的认知体验中。文章挑战了本雅明关于艺术真实性的核心观点，为数字时代的艺术创作提供了新视角。
