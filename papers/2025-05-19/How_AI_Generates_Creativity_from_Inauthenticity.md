# How AI Generates Creativity from Inauthenticity

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11463v1

## 原始摘要

Artificial creativity is presented as a counter to Benjamin's conception of
an "aura" in art. Where Benjamin sees authenticity as art's critical element,
generative artificial intelligence operates as pure inauthenticity. Two
elements of purely inauthentic art are described: elusiveness and reflection.
Elusiveness is the inability to find an origin-story for the created artwork,
and reflection is the ability for perceivers to impose any origin that serves
their own purposes. The paper subsequently argues that these elements widen the
scope of artistic and creative potential. To illustrate, an example is
developed around musical improvisation with an artificial intelligence partner.
Finally, a question is raised about whether the inauthentic creativity of AI in
art can be extended to human experience and our sense of our identities.


## AI 摘要

该论文探讨了人工智能艺术创作如何挑战本雅明提出的艺术"灵光"概念。作者指出，生成式AI创造的是纯粹非本真性的艺术，具有两个特征：难以追溯创作源头（模糊性）和允许观者自行赋予意义（投射性）。通过AI音乐即兴创作的案例，论文论证这些特性反而能拓展艺术创造力边界。最后，作者提出思考：AI的非本真性创作是否会影响人类对自我身份的认知。全文重新审视了艺术真实性的价值，为AI时代的艺术创作提供了新视角。（98字）
