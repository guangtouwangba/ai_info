# MOSAAIC: Managing Optimization towards Shared Autonomy, Authority, and Initiative in Co-creation

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11481v1

## 原始摘要

Striking the appropriate balance between humans and co-creative AI is an open
research question in computational creativity. Co-creativity, a form of hybrid
intelligence where both humans and AI take action proactively, is a process
that leads to shared creative artifacts and ideas. Achieving a balanced dynamic
in co-creativity requires characterizing control and identifying strategies to
distribute control between humans and AI. We define control as the power to
determine, initiate, and direct the process of co-creation. Informed by a
systematic literature review of 172 full-length papers, we introduce MOSAAIC
(Managing Optimization towards Shared Autonomy, Authority, and Initiative in
Co-creation), a novel framework for characterizing and balancing control in
co-creation. MOSAAIC identifies three key dimensions of control: autonomy,
initiative, and authority. We supplement our framework with control
optimization strategies in co-creation. To demonstrate MOSAAIC's applicability,
we analyze the distribution of control in six existing co-creative AI case
studies and present the implications of using this framework.


## AI 摘要

本文提出MOSAAIC框架来解决人机协同创作中的控制平衡问题。通过系统文献综述172篇论文，研究者定义了控制权的三个关键维度：自主性、主动性和权威性。该框架旨在优化人机在共同创作过程中的控制分配，确保双方都能主动参与并影响创作结果。研究还分析了6个现有案例中的控制权分配情况，验证了该框架的适用性。MOSAAIC为人机协同创作提供了结构化方法来平衡控制权，促进更有效的创意合作。
