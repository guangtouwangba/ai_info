# MOSAAIC: Managing Optimization towards Shared Autonomy, Authority, and Initiative in Co-creation

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11481v1

## 原始摘要

Striking the appropriate balance between humans and co-creative AI is an open
research question in computational creativity. Co-creativity, a form of hybrid
intelligence where both humans and AI take action proactively, is a process
that leads to shared creative artifacts and ideas. Achieving a balanced dynamic
in co-creativity requires characterizing control and identifying strategies to
distribute control between humans and AI. We define control as the power to
determine, initiate, and direct the process of co-creation. Informed by a
systematic literature review of 172 full-length papers, we introduce MOSAAIC
(Managing Optimization towards Shared Autonomy, Authority, and Initiative in
Co-creation), a novel framework for characterizing and balancing control in
co-creation. MOSAAIC identifies three key dimensions of control: autonomy,
initiative, and authority. We supplement our framework with control
optimization strategies in co-creation. To demonstrate MOSAAIC's applicability,
we analyze the distribution of control in six existing co-creative AI case
studies and present the implications of using this framework.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了人机协同创作中的控制平衡问题，提出了MOSAAIC框架来优化人类与AI在创作过程中的自主权、主动性和权威性三个维度的控制分配。基于对172篇论文的系统性综述，该框架旨在协调人机双方在共同创作中的动态平衡，确保双方都能主动参与并影响创作过程和成果。研究者通过分析六个案例研究验证了MOSAAIC的适用性，展示了如何利用该框架优化控制策略，为人机协同创作提供指导。这一研究为计算创意领域中人机协作的动态平衡提供了新的理论视角和实践工具。
