# MOSAAIC: Managing Optimization towards Shared Autonomy, Authority, and Initiative in Co-creation

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11481v1

## 原始摘要

Striking the appropriate balance between humans and co-creative AI is an open
research question in computational creativity. Co-creativity, a form of hybrid
intelligence where both humans and AI take action proactively, is a process
that leads to shared creative artifacts and ideas. Achieving a balanced dynamic
in co-creativity requires characterizing control and identifying strategies to
distribute control between humans and AI. We define control as the power to
determine, initiate, and direct the process of co-creation. Informed by a
systematic literature review of 172 full-length papers, we introduce MOSAAIC
(Managing Optimization towards Shared Autonomy, Authority, and Initiative in
Co-creation), a novel framework for characterizing and balancing control in
co-creation. MOSAAIC identifies three key dimensions of control: autonomy,
initiative, and authority. We supplement our framework with control
optimization strategies in co-creation. To demonstrate MOSAAIC's applicability,
we analyze the distribution of control in six existing co-creative AI case
studies and present the implications of using this framework.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了人类与AI在协同创作中如何平衡控制权的问题，提出了MOSAAIC框架来管理创作过程中的自主性、主动性和权威性这三个关键维度。基于对172篇文献的系统回顾，该研究将控制权定义为决定、发起和指导协同创作过程的能力，并提出了优化控制权分配的策略。通过分析6个AI协同创作案例，验证了MOSAAIC框架的适用性，展示了该框架对理解和管理人机协同创作动态的重要价值。研究为人与AI在创意过程中的权力平衡提供了新的理论视角和实践指导。
