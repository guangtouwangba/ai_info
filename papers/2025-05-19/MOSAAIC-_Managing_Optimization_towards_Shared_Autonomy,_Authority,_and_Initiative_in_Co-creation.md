# MOSAAIC: Managing Optimization towards Shared Autonomy, Authority, and Initiative in Co-creation

## 原始摘要

Striking the appropriate balance between humans and co-creative AI is an open
research question in computational creativity. Co-creativity, a form of hybrid
intelligence where both humans and AI take action proactively, is a process
that leads to shared creative artifacts and ideas. Achieving a balanced dynamic
in co-creativity requires characterizing control and identifying strategies to
distribute control between humans and AI. We define control as the power to
determine, initiate, and direct the process of co-creation. Informed by a
systematic literature review of 172 full-length papers, we introduce MOSAAIC
(Managing Optimization towards Shared Autonomy, Authority, and Initiative in
Co-creation), a novel framework for characterizing and balancing control in
co-creation. MOSAAIC identifies three key dimensions of control: autonomy,
initiative, and authority. We supplement our framework with control
optimization strategies in co-creation. To demonstrate MOSAAIC's applicability,
we analyze the distribution of control in six existing co-creative AI case
studies and present the implications of using this framework.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了人类与AI在协同创造中的平衡问题，提出了MOSAAIC框架来管理控制权分配。协同创造是一种混合智能形式，人类和AI共同主动参与创作过程。研究通过分析172篇文献，将控制权定义为三个关键维度：自主性、主动性和权威性。MOSAAIC框架提供了优化控制权分配的策略，并通过6个案例研究验证了其适用性。该研究为协调人机共创中的控制权动态平衡提供了系统方法，有助于促进更有效的协同创作过程。
