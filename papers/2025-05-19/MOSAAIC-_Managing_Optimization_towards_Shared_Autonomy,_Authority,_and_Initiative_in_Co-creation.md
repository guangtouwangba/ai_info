# MOSAAIC: Managing Optimization towards Shared Autonomy, Authority, and Initiative in Co-creation

## 原始摘要

Striking the appropriate balance between humans and co-creative AI is an open
research question in computational creativity. Co-creativity, a form of hybrid
intelligence where both humans and AI take action proactively, is a process
that leads to shared creative artifacts and ideas. Achieving a balanced dynamic
in co-creativity requires characterizing control and identifying strategies to
distribute control between humans and AI. We define control as the power to
determine, initiate, and direct the process of co-creation. Informed by a
systematic literature review of 172 full-length papers, we introduce MOSAAIC
(Managing Optimization towards Shared Autonomy, Authority, and Initiative in
Co-creation), a novel framework for characterizing and balancing control in
co-creation. MOSAAIC identifies three key dimensions of control: autonomy,
initiative, and authority. We supplement our framework with control
optimization strategies in co-creation. To demonstrate MOSAAIC's applicability,
we analyze the distribution of control in six existing co-creative AI case
studies and present the implications of using this framework.


## AI 摘要

计算创造力领域的一个关键研究问题是人类与AI共创时如何平衡控制权。共创是混合智能形式，双方主动参与并共同产出创意成果。本文通过系统文献综述（172篇论文）提出MOSAAIC框架，从自主性、主动性和权威性三个维度分析控制权分配，并提供优化策略。该框架通过6个案例研究验证了适用性，为协调人机共创中的控制权提供了新思路。MOSAAIC有助于理解并优化共创过程中的权力动态，推动更有效的人机协作创新。
