# MOSAAIC: Managing Optimization towards Shared Autonomy, Authority, and Initiative in Co-creation

## 原始摘要

Striking the appropriate balance between humans and co-creative AI is an open
research question in computational creativity. Co-creativity, a form of hybrid
intelligence where both humans and AI take action proactively, is a process
that leads to shared creative artifacts and ideas. Achieving a balanced dynamic
in co-creativity requires characterizing control and identifying strategies to
distribute control between humans and AI. We define control as the power to
determine, initiate, and direct the process of co-creation. Informed by a
systematic literature review of 172 full-length papers, we introduce MOSAAIC
(Managing Optimization towards Shared Autonomy, Authority, and Initiative in
Co-creation), a novel framework for characterizing and balancing control in
co-creation. MOSAAIC identifies three key dimensions of control: autonomy,
initiative, and authority. We supplement our framework with control
optimization strategies in co-creation. To demonstrate MOSAAIC's applicability,
we analyze the distribution of control in six existing co-creative AI case
studies and present the implications of using this framework.


## AI 摘要

计算创造力领域面临如何平衡人类与AI协同创造的核心问题。协同创造是一种混合智能形式，双方主动参与并共同产出创意成果。本研究通过系统文献综述（172篇论文），提出MOSAAIC框架，从自主性、主动性和权威性三个维度刻画协同创造中的控制权分配，并提供优化策略。该框架通过分析6个案例验证了适用性，为设计人机协同系统提供了理论指导，强调需要在创造过程中动态平衡控制权分配。研究为理解和管理人机协同创造关系提供了新视角。
