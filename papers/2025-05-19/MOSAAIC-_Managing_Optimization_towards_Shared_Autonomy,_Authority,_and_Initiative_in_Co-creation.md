# MOSAAIC: Managing Optimization towards Shared Autonomy, Authority, and Initiative in Co-creation

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11481v1

## 原始摘要

Striking the appropriate balance between humans and co-creative AI is an open
research question in computational creativity. Co-creativity, a form of hybrid
intelligence where both humans and AI take action proactively, is a process
that leads to shared creative artifacts and ideas. Achieving a balanced dynamic
in co-creativity requires characterizing control and identifying strategies to
distribute control between humans and AI. We define control as the power to
determine, initiate, and direct the process of co-creation. Informed by a
systematic literature review of 172 full-length papers, we introduce MOSAAIC
(Managing Optimization towards Shared Autonomy, Authority, and Initiative in
Co-creation), a novel framework for characterizing and balancing control in
co-creation. MOSAAIC identifies three key dimensions of control: autonomy,
initiative, and authority. We supplement our framework with control
optimization strategies in co-creation. To demonstrate MOSAAIC's applicability,
we analyze the distribution of control in six existing co-creative AI case
studies and present the implications of using this framework.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文探讨了人机协同创作中如何平衡人类与AI的控制权问题。研究者提出了MOSAAIC框架，通过系统性文献综述分析了172篇论文，将控制权划分为自主性、主动性和权威性三个维度，并提出了优化控制分配的策略。该框架旨在协调人机在共同创作过程中的权力分配，以产生更好的创意成果。研究者通过分析6个实际案例验证了MOSAAIC的适用性，展示了该框架在指导人机协同创作实践中的价值。研究为人机共创领域提供了新的理论工具，有助于优化创作过程中的控制权分配。
