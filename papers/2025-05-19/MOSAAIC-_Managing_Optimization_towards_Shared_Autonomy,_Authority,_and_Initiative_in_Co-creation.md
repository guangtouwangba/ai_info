# MOSAAIC: Managing Optimization towards Shared Autonomy, Authority, and Initiative in Co-creation

## 原始摘要

Striking the appropriate balance between humans and co-creative AI is an open
research question in computational creativity. Co-creativity, a form of hybrid
intelligence where both humans and AI take action proactively, is a process
that leads to shared creative artifacts and ideas. Achieving a balanced dynamic
in co-creativity requires characterizing control and identifying strategies to
distribute control between humans and AI. We define control as the power to
determine, initiate, and direct the process of co-creation. Informed by a
systematic literature review of 172 full-length papers, we introduce MOSAAIC
(Managing Optimization towards Shared Autonomy, Authority, and Initiative in
Co-creation), a novel framework for characterizing and balancing control in
co-creation. MOSAAIC identifies three key dimensions of control: autonomy,
initiative, and authority. We supplement our framework with control
optimization strategies in co-creation. To demonstrate MOSAAIC's applicability,
we analyze the distribution of control in six existing co-creative AI case
studies and present the implications of using this framework.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了人机协同创作中的控制平衡问题，提出了MOSAAIC框架来优化人类与AI在创作过程中的自主权、主动性和权威性分配。基于对172篇文献的系统回顾，该框架定义了控制权的三个关键维度，并提供了优化策略。通过分析6个案例研究，验证了MOSAAIC在评估和平衡人机协同创作控制权分配方面的适用性，为人机协作的创造性过程提供了新的理论工具和实践指导。
