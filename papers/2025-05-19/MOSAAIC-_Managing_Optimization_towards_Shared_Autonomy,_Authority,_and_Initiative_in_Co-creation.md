# MOSAAIC: Managing Optimization towards Shared Autonomy, Authority, and Initiative in Co-creation

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11481v1

## 原始摘要

Striking the appropriate balance between humans and co-creative AI is an open
research question in computational creativity. Co-creativity, a form of hybrid
intelligence where both humans and AI take action proactively, is a process
that leads to shared creative artifacts and ideas. Achieving a balanced dynamic
in co-creativity requires characterizing control and identifying strategies to
distribute control between humans and AI. We define control as the power to
determine, initiate, and direct the process of co-creation. Informed by a
systematic literature review of 172 full-length papers, we introduce MOSAAIC
(Managing Optimization towards Shared Autonomy, Authority, and Initiative in
Co-creation), a novel framework for characterizing and balancing control in
co-creation. MOSAAIC identifies three key dimensions of control: autonomy,
initiative, and authority. We supplement our framework with control
optimization strategies in co-creation. To demonstrate MOSAAIC's applicability,
we analyze the distribution of control in six existing co-creative AI case
studies and present the implications of using this framework.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了人类与AI在协同创作中如何平衡控制权的问题，提出了MOSAAIC框架来优化这一过程。该框架基于对172篇文献的系统回顾，将控制权划分为自主性、主动性和权威性三个维度，并提供了相应的优化策略。研究通过分析6个协同创作案例，验证了MOSAAIC的适用性，为平衡人机共创中的控制权分配提供了新思路。协同创作作为一种混合智能形式，需要合理分配控制权以促进创意产出，MOSAAIC为此提供了系统化的解决方案。
