# Authoritarian Recursions: How Fiction, History, and AI Reinforce Control in Education, Warfare, and Discourse

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09030v2

## 原始摘要

This article introduces the concept of \textit{authoritarian recursion} to
describe how artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly mediate control
across education, warfare, and digital discourse. Drawing on critical discourse
analysis and sociotechnical theory, the study reveals how AI-driven platforms
delegate judgment to algorithmic processes, normalize opacity, and recursively
reinforce behavioral norms under the guise of neutrality and optimization. Case
studies include generative AI models in classroom surveillance, autonomous
targeting in military AI systems, and content curation logics in platform
governance.
  Rather than treating these domains as disparate, the paper maps their
structural convergence within recursive architectures of abstraction,
surveillance, and classification. These feedback systems do not simply automate
tasks -- they encode modes of epistemic authority that disperse accountability
while intensifying political asymmetries. Through cultural and policy analysis,
the article argues that authoritarian recursion operates as a hybrid logic,
fusing technical abstraction with state and market imperatives. The paper
concludes by outlining implications for democratic legitimacy, human oversight,
and the political design of AI governance frameworks.
  This framework contributes to emerging debates on algorithmic accountability
by foregrounding how recursion acts not merely as a technical function but as a
sociopolitical instrument of control.


## AI 摘要

该研究提出"威权递归"概念，揭示AI系统如何在教育、军事和数字话语中通过算法中介实施控制。研究结合批判性话语分析和社会技术理论，指出AI平台以中立优化为名，将判断权委托给算法流程，使不透明操作常态化，并递归强化行为规范。案例包括课堂监控的生成式AI、军事AI的自主瞄准系统及平台内容治理逻辑。研究表明这些递归架构通过抽象化、监控和分类实现结构趋同，不仅自动化任务，更编码认知权威模式，分散责任的同时加剧政治不对称。研究强调递归既是技术功能，更是社会政治控制工具。
