# Modeling Human Behavior in a Strategic Network Game with Complex Group Dynamics

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03795v2

## 原始摘要

Human networks greatly impact important societal outcomes, including wealth
and health inequality, poverty, and bullying. As such, understanding human
networks is critical to learning how to promote favorable societal outcomes. As
a step toward better understanding human networks, we compare and contrast
several methods for learning, from a small data set, models of human behavior
in a strategic network game called the Junior High Game (JHG). These modeling
methods differ with respect to the assumptions they use to parameterize human
behavior (behavior vs. community-aware behavior) and the moments they model
(mean vs. distribution). Results show that the highest-performing method,
called hCAB, models the distribution of human behavior rather than the mean and
assumes humans use community-aware behavior rather than behavior matching. When
applied to small societies (6-11 individuals), the hCAB model closely mirrors
the population dynamics of human groups (with notable differences).
Additionally, in a user study, human participants were unable to distinguish
individual hCAB agents from other humans, thus illustrating that the hCAB model
also produces plausible (individual) human behavior in this strategic network
game.


## AI 摘要

该研究比较了多种从小数据集中学习人类在策略网络游戏（Junior High Game, JHG）中行为模型的方法。最佳方法hCAB通过建模人类行为的分布（而非均值）并假设社区感知行为（而非简单行为匹配），能更准确反映小规模群体（6-11人）的动态特征。实验表明，人类参与者无法区分hCAB智能体与真实人类行为，验证了该模型在个体层面的拟真性。这一成果为理解社会网络中的财富、健康不平等等关键问题提供了新工具，凸显了社区意识在人类网络行为建模中的重要性。（99字）
