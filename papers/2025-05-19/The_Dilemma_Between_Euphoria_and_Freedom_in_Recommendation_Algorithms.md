# The Dilemma Between Euphoria and Freedom in Recommendation Algorithms

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11465v1

## 原始摘要

Today's AI recommendation algorithms produce a human dilemma between euphoria
and freedom. To elaborate, four ways that recommenders reshape experience are
delineated. First, the human experience of convenience is tuned to euphoric
perfection. Second, a kind of personal authenticity becomes capturable with
algorithms and data. Third, a conception of human freedom emerges, one that
promotes unfamiliar interests for users instead of satisfying those that
already exist. Finally, a new human dilemma is posed between two types of
personal identity. On one side, there are recommendation algorithms that locate
a user's core preferences, and then reinforce that identity with options
designed to resemble those that have already proved satisfying. The result is
an algorithmic production of euphoria and authenticity. On the other side,
there are recommenders that provoke unfamiliar interests and curiosities. These
proposals deny the existence of an authentic self and instead promote new
preferences and experiences. The result is a human freedom of new personal
identity.


## AI 摘要

当前AI推荐算法在用户体验上制造了一个"欣快感与自由"的悖论：一方面，算法通过精准匹配用户既有偏好，创造完美便利的欣快体验和"真实自我"的幻觉；另一方面，有些算法刻意激发用户陌生兴趣，否定固定不变的"真实自我"，倡导探索新身份的自由。这形成了两种身份认同的张力——是安于算法强化的舒适圈，还是拥抱算法引导的自我突破。推荐系统由此重塑了人类四大体验维度：极致便利的欣快感、数据化的"真实性"、发掘潜在兴趣的新型自由观，以及身份认同的根本矛盾。
