# The Dilemma Between Euphoria and Freedom in Recommendation Algorithms

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11465v1

## 原始摘要

Today's AI recommendation algorithms produce a human dilemma between euphoria
and freedom. To elaborate, four ways that recommenders reshape experience are
delineated. First, the human experience of convenience is tuned to euphoric
perfection. Second, a kind of personal authenticity becomes capturable with
algorithms and data. Third, a conception of human freedom emerges, one that
promotes unfamiliar interests for users instead of satisfying those that
already exist. Finally, a new human dilemma is posed between two types of
personal identity. On one side, there are recommendation algorithms that locate
a user's core preferences, and then reinforce that identity with options
designed to resemble those that have already proved satisfying. The result is
an algorithmic production of euphoria and authenticity. On the other side,
there are recommenders that provoke unfamiliar interests and curiosities. These
proposals deny the existence of an authentic self and instead promote new
preferences and experiences. The result is a human freedom of new personal
identity.


## AI 摘要

AI推荐算法给人类带来了"愉悦与自由"的困境。一方面，算法通过精准推荐熟悉内容，带来极致的便利感和"真实自我"的满足；另一方面，突破常规的推荐则激发新兴趣，否定固定身份，创造重塑自我的自由。这呈现出四种影响：1）极致便利带来愉悦体验；2）算法可捕捉"真实自我"；3）自由体现为培养新兴趣而非满足既有需求；4）最终形成两种身份认同的困境——强化固有偏好的"算法愉悦"与探索新可能的"身份自由"。这种张力反映了数字时代人类自我认知的根本矛盾。
