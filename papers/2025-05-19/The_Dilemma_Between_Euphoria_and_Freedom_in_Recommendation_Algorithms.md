# The Dilemma Between Euphoria and Freedom in Recommendation Algorithms

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11465v1

## 原始摘要

Today's AI recommendation algorithms produce a human dilemma between euphoria
and freedom. To elaborate, four ways that recommenders reshape experience are
delineated. First, the human experience of convenience is tuned to euphoric
perfection. Second, a kind of personal authenticity becomes capturable with
algorithms and data. Third, a conception of human freedom emerges, one that
promotes unfamiliar interests for users instead of satisfying those that
already exist. Finally, a new human dilemma is posed between two types of
personal identity. On one side, there are recommendation algorithms that locate
a user's core preferences, and then reinforce that identity with options
designed to resemble those that have already proved satisfying. The result is
an algorithmic production of euphoria and authenticity. On the other side,
there are recommenders that provoke unfamiliar interests and curiosities. These
proposals deny the existence of an authentic self and instead promote new
preferences and experiences. The result is a human freedom of new personal
identity.


## AI 摘要

当前AI推荐算法带来了"愉悦与自由"的人类困境：1)算法将便利性优化到极致，产生愉悦感；2)通过数据捕捉某种"个人真实性"；3)创造新型自由，激发用户未知兴趣而非满足现有需求；4)形成两种身份认同的冲突：一种是强化用户核心偏好的算法，通过重复相似选项制造愉悦与真实感；另一种是否定真实自我存在，通过推荐陌生内容促进新偏好，实现身份重塑的自由。这揭示了算法时代人类在保持真实自我与探索新身份之间的根本矛盾。（99字）
