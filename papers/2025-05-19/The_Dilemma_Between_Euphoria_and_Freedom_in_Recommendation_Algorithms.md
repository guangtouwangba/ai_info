# The Dilemma Between Euphoria and Freedom in Recommendation Algorithms

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11465v1

## 原始摘要

Today's AI recommendation algorithms produce a human dilemma between euphoria
and freedom. To elaborate, four ways that recommenders reshape experience are
delineated. First, the human experience of convenience is tuned to euphoric
perfection. Second, a kind of personal authenticity becomes capturable with
algorithms and data. Third, a conception of human freedom emerges, one that
promotes unfamiliar interests for users instead of satisfying those that
already exist. Finally, a new human dilemma is posed between two types of
personal identity. On one side, there are recommendation algorithms that locate
a user's core preferences, and then reinforce that identity with options
designed to resemble those that have already proved satisfying. The result is
an algorithmic production of euphoria and authenticity. On the other side,
there are recommenders that provoke unfamiliar interests and curiosities. These
proposals deny the existence of an authentic self and instead promote new
preferences and experiences. The result is a human freedom of new personal
identity.


## AI 摘要

推荐算法给人类带来了"愉悦与自由"的两难困境。算法通过四种方式重塑体验：1）将便利性优化到极致愉悦；2）用数据捕捉个人真实性；3）创造新的自由概念，激发用户未知兴趣而非满足现有需求；4）制造两种身份认同的冲突。一方面，算法通过强化已知偏好制造确定性的愉悦和真实感；另一方面，通过激发新兴趣否定固定自我，创造重塑身份的自由。这形成了算法时代人类面临的核心矛盾——是选择被算法定义的"真实自我"，还是追求不断更新的"自由自我"。（99字）
