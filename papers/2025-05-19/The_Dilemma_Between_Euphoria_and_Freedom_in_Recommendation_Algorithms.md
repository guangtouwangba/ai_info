# The Dilemma Between Euphoria and Freedom in Recommendation Algorithms

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11465v1

## 原始摘要

Today's AI recommendation algorithms produce a human dilemma between euphoria
and freedom. To elaborate, four ways that recommenders reshape experience are
delineated. First, the human experience of convenience is tuned to euphoric
perfection. Second, a kind of personal authenticity becomes capturable with
algorithms and data. Third, a conception of human freedom emerges, one that
promotes unfamiliar interests for users instead of satisfying those that
already exist. Finally, a new human dilemma is posed between two types of
personal identity. On one side, there are recommendation algorithms that locate
a user's core preferences, and then reinforce that identity with options
designed to resemble those that have already proved satisfying. The result is
an algorithmic production of euphoria and authenticity. On the other side,
there are recommenders that provoke unfamiliar interests and curiosities. These
proposals deny the existence of an authentic self and instead promote new
preferences and experiences. The result is a human freedom of new personal
identity.


## AI 摘要

当前AI推荐算法在用户体验中制造了"愉悦与自由"的悖论：一方面通过精准匹配用户既有偏好，制造愉悦感和身份认同；另一方面则激发新兴趣，促进身份重塑。具体表现为：1）优化便利性带来极致愉悦；2）用数据建构"真实自我"；3）通过发掘新兴趣拓展自由；4）最终形成两种身份认知的张力——强化固有偏好的算法塑造稳定身份，而探索新兴趣的算法推动身份流动。这种张力揭示了数字时代身份认同的新困境：是选择算法强化的"真实自我"，还是拥抱算法引导的"可能自我"。（99字）
