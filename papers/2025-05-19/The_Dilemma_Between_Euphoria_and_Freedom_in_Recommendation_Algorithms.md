# The Dilemma Between Euphoria and Freedom in Recommendation Algorithms

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11465v1

## 原始摘要

Today's AI recommendation algorithms produce a human dilemma between euphoria
and freedom. To elaborate, four ways that recommenders reshape experience are
delineated. First, the human experience of convenience is tuned to euphoric
perfection. Second, a kind of personal authenticity becomes capturable with
algorithms and data. Third, a conception of human freedom emerges, one that
promotes unfamiliar interests for users instead of satisfying those that
already exist. Finally, a new human dilemma is posed between two types of
personal identity. On one side, there are recommendation algorithms that locate
a user's core preferences, and then reinforce that identity with options
designed to resemble those that have already proved satisfying. The result is
an algorithmic production of euphoria and authenticity. On the other side,
there are recommenders that provoke unfamiliar interests and curiosities. These
proposals deny the existence of an authentic self and instead promote new
preferences and experiences. The result is a human freedom of new personal
identity.


## AI 摘要

AI推荐算法在人类体验中制造了愉悦与自由的矛盾：一方面通过精准推荐带来便利和愉悦感，强化用户现有偏好，塑造"真实自我"；另一方面则激发陌生兴趣，否定固定身份，提倡新体验的自由。这形成了两种身份认知的张力——算法既可能固化已知偏好（产生愉悦与真实感），也可能开拓未知领域（创造身份自由）。最终呈现出当代数字生活的核心困境：是选择算法强化的舒适区，还是拥抱算法引导的自我革新。
