# The Dilemma Between Euphoria and Freedom in Recommendation Algorithms

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11465v1

## 原始摘要

Today's AI recommendation algorithms produce a human dilemma between euphoria
and freedom. To elaborate, four ways that recommenders reshape experience are
delineated. First, the human experience of convenience is tuned to euphoric
perfection. Second, a kind of personal authenticity becomes capturable with
algorithms and data. Third, a conception of human freedom emerges, one that
promotes unfamiliar interests for users instead of satisfying those that
already exist. Finally, a new human dilemma is posed between two types of
personal identity. On one side, there are recommendation algorithms that locate
a user's core preferences, and then reinforce that identity with options
designed to resemble those that have already proved satisfying. The result is
an algorithmic production of euphoria and authenticity. On the other side,
there are recommenders that provoke unfamiliar interests and curiosities. These
proposals deny the existence of an authentic self and instead promote new
preferences and experiences. The result is a human freedom of new personal
identity.


## AI 摘要

AI推荐算法带来了人类在愉悦与自由之间的两难困境。首先，算法通过精准推荐带来极致便利的愉悦体验；其次，算法能捕捉某种个人真实性；第三，算法催生了一种新自由观，即激发用户未知兴趣而非满足现有需求。最终，这形成了两种身份认同的冲突：一类算法强化用户核心偏好，制造愉悦与真实感；另一类则激发新兴趣，否认真实自我，提倡新体验，带来身份重塑的自由。这种矛盾体现了技术对人类体验的双重影响。
