# The Dilemma Between Euphoria and Freedom in Recommendation Algorithms

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11465v1

## 原始摘要

Today's AI recommendation algorithms produce a human dilemma between euphoria
and freedom. To elaborate, four ways that recommenders reshape experience are
delineated. First, the human experience of convenience is tuned to euphoric
perfection. Second, a kind of personal authenticity becomes capturable with
algorithms and data. Third, a conception of human freedom emerges, one that
promotes unfamiliar interests for users instead of satisfying those that
already exist. Finally, a new human dilemma is posed between two types of
personal identity. On one side, there are recommendation algorithms that locate
a user's core preferences, and then reinforce that identity with options
designed to resemble those that have already proved satisfying. The result is
an algorithmic production of euphoria and authenticity. On the other side,
there are recommenders that provoke unfamiliar interests and curiosities. These
proposals deny the existence of an authentic self and instead promote new
preferences and experiences. The result is a human freedom of new personal
identity.


## AI 摘要

当前AI推荐算法在人类体验中制造了一个"愉悦与自由"的困境：一方面通过精准推荐带来极致便利和强化既有偏好的"真实自我"；另一方面则通过激发新兴趣来否定固定自我，创造身份自由。这体现在四个维度：1)优化便利体验至完美境界；2)用数据捕捉个人真实性；3)通过发掘新兴趣重新定义自由；4)最终形成两种身份认同的冲突——是选择算法强化的"真实自我"，还是拥抱算法催生的"新自我"。这种张力构成了数字时代人类面临的核心困境。（99字）
