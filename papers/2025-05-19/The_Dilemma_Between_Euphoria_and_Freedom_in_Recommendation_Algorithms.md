# The Dilemma Between Euphoria and Freedom in Recommendation Algorithms

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11465v1

## 原始摘要

Today's AI recommendation algorithms produce a human dilemma between euphoria
and freedom. To elaborate, four ways that recommenders reshape experience are
delineated. First, the human experience of convenience is tuned to euphoric
perfection. Second, a kind of personal authenticity becomes capturable with
algorithms and data. Third, a conception of human freedom emerges, one that
promotes unfamiliar interests for users instead of satisfying those that
already exist. Finally, a new human dilemma is posed between two types of
personal identity. On one side, there are recommendation algorithms that locate
a user's core preferences, and then reinforce that identity with options
designed to resemble those that have already proved satisfying. The result is
an algorithmic production of euphoria and authenticity. On the other side,
there are recommenders that provoke unfamiliar interests and curiosities. These
proposals deny the existence of an authentic self and instead promote new
preferences and experiences. The result is a human freedom of new personal
identity.


## AI 摘要

当前AI推荐算法在用户体验上制造了两种对立：一种是基于已知偏好强化用户核心身份，通过精准推荐带来愉悦感和真实性；另一种则是激发新兴趣，打破固有偏好以创造新的身份认同，强调自由探索。前者通过算法优化实现便利与满足，后者则挑战"真实自我"概念，推动未知体验。这形成了"愉悦与自由"的根本矛盾——是选择算法强化的稳定身份，还是拥抱算法引导的自我重塑。两种模式分别对应着不同的价值观：确定性满足vs开放性自由，反映了数字时代身份认同的新困境。
