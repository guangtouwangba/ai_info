# The Dilemma Between Euphoria and Freedom in Recommendation Algorithms

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11465v1

## 原始摘要

Today's AI recommendation algorithms produce a human dilemma between euphoria
and freedom. To elaborate, four ways that recommenders reshape experience are
delineated. First, the human experience of convenience is tuned to euphoric
perfection. Second, a kind of personal authenticity becomes capturable with
algorithms and data. Third, a conception of human freedom emerges, one that
promotes unfamiliar interests for users instead of satisfying those that
already exist. Finally, a new human dilemma is posed between two types of
personal identity. On one side, there are recommendation algorithms that locate
a user's core preferences, and then reinforce that identity with options
designed to resemble those that have already proved satisfying. The result is
an algorithmic production of euphoria and authenticity. On the other side,
there are recommenders that provoke unfamiliar interests and curiosities. These
proposals deny the existence of an authentic self and instead promote new
preferences and experiences. The result is a human freedom of new personal
identity.


## AI 摘要

当前AI推荐算法在人类体验中制造了"愉悦与自由"的悖论：一方面通过精准匹配用户既有偏好，制造完美便利的愉悦体验和算法认证的"真实自我"；另一方面则通过激发新兴趣来否定固定身份，创造重塑自我的自由。这形成了两种身份认知的张力——是选择算法强化的稳定身份带来的确定感，还是拥抱推荐系统促发的未知可能。前者生产可量化的真实性与满足感，后者则解构"本真自我"概念，通过持续拓展兴趣边界来实现人的自由。这种根本性矛盾正在重塑数字时代的人类体验范式。
