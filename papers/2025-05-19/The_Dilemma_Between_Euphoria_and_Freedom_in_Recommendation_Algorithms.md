# The Dilemma Between Euphoria and Freedom in Recommendation Algorithms

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11465v1

## 原始摘要

Today's AI recommendation algorithms produce a human dilemma between euphoria
and freedom. To elaborate, four ways that recommenders reshape experience are
delineated. First, the human experience of convenience is tuned to euphoric
perfection. Second, a kind of personal authenticity becomes capturable with
algorithms and data. Third, a conception of human freedom emerges, one that
promotes unfamiliar interests for users instead of satisfying those that
already exist. Finally, a new human dilemma is posed between two types of
personal identity. On one side, there are recommendation algorithms that locate
a user's core preferences, and then reinforce that identity with options
designed to resemble those that have already proved satisfying. The result is
an algorithmic production of euphoria and authenticity. On the other side,
there are recommenders that provoke unfamiliar interests and curiosities. These
proposals deny the existence of an authentic self and instead promote new
preferences and experiences. The result is a human freedom of new personal
identity.


## AI 摘要

当前AI推荐算法在用户体验上制造了一个"愉悦与自由"的悖论：一方面通过精准推荐带来极致的便利快感，用数据塑造出"真实自我"的幻觉；另一方面则通过激发新兴趣来重新定义自由，否定固定不变的"本真性"。这形成了两种身份建构路径——或是强化固有偏好产生算法愉悦，或是开拓新体验获得身份自由。这种二元对立提出了数字时代的新困境：我们究竟要算法巩固已知的"真实自我"，还是让其帮助我们突破旧有身份边界？(98字)
