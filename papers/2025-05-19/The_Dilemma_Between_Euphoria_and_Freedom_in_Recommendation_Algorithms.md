# The Dilemma Between Euphoria and Freedom in Recommendation Algorithms

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11465v1

## 原始摘要

Today's AI recommendation algorithms produce a human dilemma between euphoria
and freedom. To elaborate, four ways that recommenders reshape experience are
delineated. First, the human experience of convenience is tuned to euphoric
perfection. Second, a kind of personal authenticity becomes capturable with
algorithms and data. Third, a conception of human freedom emerges, one that
promotes unfamiliar interests for users instead of satisfying those that
already exist. Finally, a new human dilemma is posed between two types of
personal identity. On one side, there are recommendation algorithms that locate
a user's core preferences, and then reinforce that identity with options
designed to resemble those that have already proved satisfying. The result is
an algorithmic production of euphoria and authenticity. On the other side,
there are recommenders that provoke unfamiliar interests and curiosities. These
proposals deny the existence of an authentic self and instead promote new
preferences and experiences. The result is a human freedom of new personal
identity.


## AI 摘要

推荐算法给人类带来了愉悦与自由的两难困境。一方面，算法通过精准满足用户现有偏好，创造出极致的便利感和"真实自我"的幻觉；另一方面，某些算法会主动激发用户的新兴趣，否定固定不变的"真实自我"，提供重塑身份的自由。这形成了两种对立体验：前者通过强化既有偏好产生确定性的愉悦和认同感，后者则通过开拓未知领域提供自我更新的可能性。这种张力揭示了数字时代人类面临的根本选择——是安于算法强化的舒适区，还是拥抱算法带来的自我突破。
