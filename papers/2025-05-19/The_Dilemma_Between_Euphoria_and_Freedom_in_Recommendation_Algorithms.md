# The Dilemma Between Euphoria and Freedom in Recommendation Algorithms

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11465v1

## 原始摘要

Today's AI recommendation algorithms produce a human dilemma between euphoria
and freedom. To elaborate, four ways that recommenders reshape experience are
delineated. First, the human experience of convenience is tuned to euphoric
perfection. Second, a kind of personal authenticity becomes capturable with
algorithms and data. Third, a conception of human freedom emerges, one that
promotes unfamiliar interests for users instead of satisfying those that
already exist. Finally, a new human dilemma is posed between two types of
personal identity. On one side, there are recommendation algorithms that locate
a user's core preferences, and then reinforce that identity with options
designed to resemble those that have already proved satisfying. The result is
an algorithmic production of euphoria and authenticity. On the other side,
there are recommenders that provoke unfamiliar interests and curiosities. These
proposals deny the existence of an authentic self and instead promote new
preferences and experiences. The result is a human freedom of new personal
identity.


## AI 摘要

AI推荐算法在用户体验中制造了愉悦与自由的两难困境：一方面，算法通过精准匹配用户既有偏好，制造愉悦感和"真实自我"的假象；另一方面，某些算法会主动激发用户的新兴趣，否定固定身份认同，提供重塑自我的自由。这揭示了推荐系统的四种影响：极致便利带来快感、算法可捕捉"真实性"、催生新兴趣的自由理念，以及核心偏好强化派与兴趣拓展派之间的身份认同冲突。前者通过重复相似选择巩固既有身份，后者则通过未知探索提供身份重塑的可能，形成了当代数字化生存的基本矛盾。
