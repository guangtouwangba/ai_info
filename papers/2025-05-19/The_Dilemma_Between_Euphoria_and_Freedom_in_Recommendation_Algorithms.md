# The Dilemma Between Euphoria and Freedom in Recommendation Algorithms

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11465v1

## 原始摘要

Today's AI recommendation algorithms produce a human dilemma between euphoria
and freedom. To elaborate, four ways that recommenders reshape experience are
delineated. First, the human experience of convenience is tuned to euphoric
perfection. Second, a kind of personal authenticity becomes capturable with
algorithms and data. Third, a conception of human freedom emerges, one that
promotes unfamiliar interests for users instead of satisfying those that
already exist. Finally, a new human dilemma is posed between two types of
personal identity. On one side, there are recommendation algorithms that locate
a user's core preferences, and then reinforce that identity with options
designed to resemble those that have already proved satisfying. The result is
an algorithmic production of euphoria and authenticity. On the other side,
there are recommenders that provoke unfamiliar interests and curiosities. These
proposals deny the existence of an authentic self and instead promote new
preferences and experiences. The result is a human freedom of new personal
identity.


## AI 摘要

当前AI推荐算法带来了"愉悦与自由"的人类困境。算法通过四种方式重塑体验：1)将便利性优化到极致愉悦；2)用数据捕捉个人真实性；3)创造新兴趣而非满足现有需求的新自由观；4)引发两种身份认同的冲突。一方面，算法通过强化用户核心偏好来制造愉悦感和真实性；另一方面，激发新兴趣的推荐否认真实自我的存在，促进新偏好，带来重塑身份的自由。这形成了算法制造的愉悦/真实性与探索新身份的自由之间的根本矛盾。（99字）
