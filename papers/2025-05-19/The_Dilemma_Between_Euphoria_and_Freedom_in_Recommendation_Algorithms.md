# The Dilemma Between Euphoria and Freedom in Recommendation Algorithms

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11465v1

## 原始摘要

Today's AI recommendation algorithms produce a human dilemma between euphoria
and freedom. To elaborate, four ways that recommenders reshape experience are
delineated. First, the human experience of convenience is tuned to euphoric
perfection. Second, a kind of personal authenticity becomes capturable with
algorithms and data. Third, a conception of human freedom emerges, one that
promotes unfamiliar interests for users instead of satisfying those that
already exist. Finally, a new human dilemma is posed between two types of
personal identity. On one side, there are recommendation algorithms that locate
a user's core preferences, and then reinforce that identity with options
designed to resemble those that have already proved satisfying. The result is
an algorithmic production of euphoria and authenticity. On the other side,
there are recommenders that provoke unfamiliar interests and curiosities. These
proposals deny the existence of an authentic self and instead promote new
preferences and experiences. The result is a human freedom of new personal
identity.


## AI 摘要

AI推荐算法在用户体验中制造了愉悦与自由的矛盾：一方面，算法通过精准推荐带来极致的便利感和"真实自我"的强化，产生愉悦与身份认同；另一方面，突破性推荐则激发用户探索未知兴趣，否定固定身份，创造重塑自我的自由。这形成了两种对立模式：固化偏好型算法通过相似推荐制造确定性的愉悦体验，而开拓型算法则通过陌生化推荐促进自我更新。这种张力揭示了数字时代人类面临的根本困境——是选择算法强化的稳定认同，还是拥抱算法催生的身份流动性。（99字）
