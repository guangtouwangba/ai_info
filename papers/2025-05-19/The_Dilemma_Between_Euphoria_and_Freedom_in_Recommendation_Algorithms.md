# The Dilemma Between Euphoria and Freedom in Recommendation Algorithms

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11465v1

## 原始摘要

Today's AI recommendation algorithms produce a human dilemma between euphoria
and freedom. To elaborate, four ways that recommenders reshape experience are
delineated. First, the human experience of convenience is tuned to euphoric
perfection. Second, a kind of personal authenticity becomes capturable with
algorithms and data. Third, a conception of human freedom emerges, one that
promotes unfamiliar interests for users instead of satisfying those that
already exist. Finally, a new human dilemma is posed between two types of
personal identity. On one side, there are recommendation algorithms that locate
a user's core preferences, and then reinforce that identity with options
designed to resemble those that have already proved satisfying. The result is
an algorithmic production of euphoria and authenticity. On the other side,
there are recommenders that provoke unfamiliar interests and curiosities. These
proposals deny the existence of an authentic self and instead promote new
preferences and experiences. The result is a human freedom of new personal
identity.


## AI 摘要

AI推荐算法带来了"愉悦与自由"的人类困境。一方面，算法通过精准推荐熟悉的偏好，创造便利完美的愉悦体验和可量化的个人真实性；另一方面，某些算法会激发用户不熟悉的兴趣，否定固定"真实自我"的概念，促进新偏好和身份的形成，实现个人自由。这形成了两种身份认同的张力：前者强化既有偏好，产生算法制造的愉悦与真实；后者鼓励探索未知，带来重塑身份的自由。这种二元对立揭示了技术如何重塑人类体验的核心矛盾。
