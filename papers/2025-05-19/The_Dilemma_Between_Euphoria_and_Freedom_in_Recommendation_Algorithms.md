# The Dilemma Between Euphoria and Freedom in Recommendation Algorithms

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11465v1

## 原始摘要

Today's AI recommendation algorithms produce a human dilemma between euphoria
and freedom. To elaborate, four ways that recommenders reshape experience are
delineated. First, the human experience of convenience is tuned to euphoric
perfection. Second, a kind of personal authenticity becomes capturable with
algorithms and data. Third, a conception of human freedom emerges, one that
promotes unfamiliar interests for users instead of satisfying those that
already exist. Finally, a new human dilemma is posed between two types of
personal identity. On one side, there are recommendation algorithms that locate
a user's core preferences, and then reinforce that identity with options
designed to resemble those that have already proved satisfying. The result is
an algorithmic production of euphoria and authenticity. On the other side,
there are recommenders that provoke unfamiliar interests and curiosities. These
proposals deny the existence of an authentic self and instead promote new
preferences and experiences. The result is a human freedom of new personal
identity.


## AI 摘要

当前AI推荐算法在用户体验上制造了"愉悦与自由"的悖论：一方面通过精准匹配用户既有偏好，制造愉悦感和所谓"真实自我"的幻觉；另一方面则通过激发新兴趣来解构固定身份，提供重塑自我的自由。算法通过四种方式重塑体验：极致便利带来快感、数据化呈现"真实自我"、培养全新兴趣替代既有偏好，最终形成两种身份认同的冲突——强化固有偏好的算法制造确定性的愉悦，而激发新兴趣的算法则提供突破自我的自由。这种张力构成了数字时代的新型人性困境。（99字）
