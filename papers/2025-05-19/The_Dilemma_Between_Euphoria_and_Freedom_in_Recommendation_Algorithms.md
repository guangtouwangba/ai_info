# The Dilemma Between Euphoria and Freedom in Recommendation Algorithms

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11465v1

## 原始摘要

Today's AI recommendation algorithms produce a human dilemma between euphoria
and freedom. To elaborate, four ways that recommenders reshape experience are
delineated. First, the human experience of convenience is tuned to euphoric
perfection. Second, a kind of personal authenticity becomes capturable with
algorithms and data. Third, a conception of human freedom emerges, one that
promotes unfamiliar interests for users instead of satisfying those that
already exist. Finally, a new human dilemma is posed between two types of
personal identity. On one side, there are recommendation algorithms that locate
a user's core preferences, and then reinforce that identity with options
designed to resemble those that have already proved satisfying. The result is
an algorithmic production of euphoria and authenticity. On the other side,
there are recommenders that provoke unfamiliar interests and curiosities. These
proposals deny the existence of an authentic self and instead promote new
preferences and experiences. The result is a human freedom of new personal
identity.


## AI 摘要

AI推荐算法在用户体验上制造了一种介于"愉悦"与"自由"之间的两难困境。一方面，算法通过精准推荐符合用户现有偏好的内容，带来便利性和真实感的极致体验；另一方面，某些算法会主动激发用户的新兴趣，否定固定"真实自我"的存在，创造重塑个人身份的自由。这形成了两种对立模式：前者强化用户核心偏好，产生算法制造的愉悦与真实感；后者则通过推荐陌生内容，促进新偏好和体验，实现身份重塑的自由。这种矛盾揭示了当代推荐系统带来的新型人性困境。
