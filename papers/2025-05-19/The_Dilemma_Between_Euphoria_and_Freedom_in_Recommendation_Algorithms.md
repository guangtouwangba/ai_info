# The Dilemma Between Euphoria and Freedom in Recommendation Algorithms

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11465v1

## 原始摘要

Today's AI recommendation algorithms produce a human dilemma between euphoria
and freedom. To elaborate, four ways that recommenders reshape experience are
delineated. First, the human experience of convenience is tuned to euphoric
perfection. Second, a kind of personal authenticity becomes capturable with
algorithms and data. Third, a conception of human freedom emerges, one that
promotes unfamiliar interests for users instead of satisfying those that
already exist. Finally, a new human dilemma is posed between two types of
personal identity. On one side, there are recommendation algorithms that locate
a user's core preferences, and then reinforce that identity with options
designed to resemble those that have already proved satisfying. The result is
an algorithmic production of euphoria and authenticity. On the other side,
there are recommenders that provoke unfamiliar interests and curiosities. These
proposals deny the existence of an authentic self and instead promote new
preferences and experiences. The result is a human freedom of new personal
identity.


## AI 摘要

当前AI推荐算法在用户体验上制造了"愉悦与自由"的悖论：一方面通过精准匹配用户既有偏好，制造舒适完美的愉悦感，强化所谓"真实自我"；另一方面则通过激发新兴趣来拓展用户认知边界，提供重塑身份的自由。这形成了两种身份认同路径——前者用算法固化现有偏好，制造确定的真实感；后者否定固定自我，鼓励探索未知。算法由此既成为自我强化的工具，又充当突破桎梏的媒介，最终在"确认已知自我"与"发现未知自我"之间，构成了现代人面临的新型数字生存困境。（99字）
