# Exposing the Impact of GenAI for Cybercrime: An Investigation into the Dark Side

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23733v1

## 原始摘要

In recent years, the rapid advancement and democratization of generative AI
models have sparked significant debate over safety, ethical risks, and dual-use
concerns, particularly in the context of cybersecurity. While anecdotally
known, this paper provides empirical evidence regarding generative AI's
association with malicious internet-related activities and cybercrime by
examining the phenomenon through psychological frameworks of technological
amplification and affordance theory. Using a quasi-experimental design with
interrupted time series analysis, we analyze two datasets, one general and one
cryptocurrency-focused, to empirically assess generative AI's role in
cybercrime. The findings contribute to ongoing discussions about AI governance
by balancing control and fostering innovation, underscoring the need for
strategies to guide policymakers, inform AI developers and cybersecurity
professionals, and educate the public to maximize AI's benefits while
mitigating its risks.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文通过心理学视角（技术放大效应和可供性理论）及准实验设计，实证研究了生成式AI与网络恶意活动及网络犯罪的关联。分析两类数据集（通用型和加密货币相关）后发现，AI既可能放大犯罪风险，也可能提供防御机会。研究为AI治理提供了平衡管控与创新的依据，强调需制定策略指导政策制定者、AI开发者、网络安全专家，并加强公众教育，以最大化AI效益并降低风险。成果推动了关于AI安全与伦理的讨论，尤其针对网络安全领域的双刃剑效应。
