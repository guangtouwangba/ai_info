# From Chat Logs to Collective Insights: Aggregative Question Answering

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23765v1

## 原始摘要

Conversational agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are rapidly
becoming integral to our daily interactions, generating unprecedented amounts
of conversational data. Such datasets offer a powerful lens into societal
interests, trending topics, and collective concerns. Yet, existing approaches
typically treat these interactions as independent and miss critical insights
that could emerge from aggregating and reasoning across large-scale
conversation logs. In this paper, we introduce Aggregative Question Answering,
a novel task requiring models to reason explicitly over thousands of
user-chatbot interactions to answer aggregative queries, such as identifying
emerging concerns among specific demographics. To enable research in this
direction, we construct a benchmark, WildChat-AQA, comprising 6,027 aggregative
questions derived from 182,330 real-world chatbot conversations. Experiments
show that existing methods either struggle to reason effectively or incur
prohibitive computational costs, underscoring the need for new approaches
capable of extracting collective insights from large-scale conversational data.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文提出了一种名为"聚合问答"(Aggregative Question Answering)的新任务，要求模型能够分析大量用户与AI助手的对话数据来回答聚合性问题。研究者构建了包含6,027个聚合问题的WildChat-AQA基准数据集，源自182,330条真实对话记录。实验表明，现有方法要么推理能力不足，要么计算成本过高，凸显了开发新方法从大规模对话数据中提取集体洞察的必要性。该研究为利用海量对话数据识别社会兴趣、热点话题和群体关切提供了新思路。
