# From Chat Logs to Collective Insights: Aggregative Question Answering

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23765v1

## 原始摘要

Conversational agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are rapidly
becoming integral to our daily interactions, generating unprecedented amounts
of conversational data. Such datasets offer a powerful lens into societal
interests, trending topics, and collective concerns. Yet, existing approaches
typically treat these interactions as independent and miss critical insights
that could emerge from aggregating and reasoning across large-scale
conversation logs. In this paper, we introduce Aggregative Question Answering,
a novel task requiring models to reason explicitly over thousands of
user-chatbot interactions to answer aggregative queries, such as identifying
emerging concerns among specific demographics. To enable research in this
direction, we construct a benchmark, WildChat-AQA, comprising 6,027 aggregative
questions derived from 182,330 real-world chatbot conversations. Experiments
show that existing methods either struggle to reason effectively or incur
prohibitive computational costs, underscoring the need for new approaches
capable of extracting collective insights from large-scale conversational data.


## AI 摘要

大型语言模型(LLM)驱动的对话系统正快速融入日常生活，产生海量对话数据。这些数据能反映社会兴趣、热点话题和集体关切，但现有方法通常孤立处理对话，错失了大规模对话日志聚合分析的价值。为此，研究者提出"聚合问答"新任务，要求模型基于数千条用户-聊天机器人交互进行推理，以回答如"特定人群关注点"等聚合查询。他们构建了WildChat-AQA基准测试，包含182,330条真实对话衍生的6,027个聚合问题。实验表明，现有方法要么推理能力不足，要么计算成本过高，亟需能有效提取集体洞察的新方法。
