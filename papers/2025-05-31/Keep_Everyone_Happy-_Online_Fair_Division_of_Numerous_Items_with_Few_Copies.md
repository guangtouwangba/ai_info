# Keep Everyone Happy: Online Fair Division of Numerous Items with Few Copies

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12845v2

## 原始摘要

This paper considers a novel variant of the online fair division problem
involving multiple agents in which a learner sequentially observes an
indivisible item that has to be irrevocably allocated to one of the agents
while satisfying a fairness and efficiency constraint. Existing algorithms
assume a small number of items with a sufficiently large number of copies,
which ensures a good utility estimation for all item-agent pairs from noisy
bandit feedback. However, this assumption may not hold in many real-life
applications, for example, an online platform that has a large number of users
(items) who use the platform's service providers (agents) only a few times (a
few copies of items), which makes it difficult to accurately estimate utilities
for all item-agent pairs. To address this, we assume utility is an unknown
function of item-agent features. We then propose algorithms that model online
fair division as a contextual bandit problem, with sub-linear regret
guarantees. Our experimental results further validate the effectiveness of the
proposed algorithms.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文提出了一种新的在线公平分配问题变体，其中学习者需要顺序观察不可分割的项目，并将其不可撤销地分配给多个代理，同时满足公平和效率约束。现有算法假设项目数量少且有足够多的副本，以确保从噪声反馈中准确估计所有项目-代理对的效用。然而，现实场景中（如在线平台）可能存在大量用户（项目）仅使用少量服务（少量项目副本），导致效用估计困难。为此，作者假设效用是项目-代理特征的未知函数，并提出将问题建模为上下文赌博机问题的算法，具有次线性遗憾保证，实验验证了其有效性。
