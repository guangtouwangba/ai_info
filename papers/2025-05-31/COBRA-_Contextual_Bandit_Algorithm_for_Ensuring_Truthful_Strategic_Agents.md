# COBRA: Contextual Bandit Algorithm for Ensuring Truthful Strategic Agents

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23720v1

## 原始摘要

This paper considers a contextual bandit problem involving multiple agents,
where a learner sequentially observes the contexts and the agent's reported
arms, and then selects the arm that maximizes the system's overall reward.
Existing work in contextual bandits assumes that agents truthfully report their
arms, which is unrealistic in many real-life applications. For instance,
consider an online platform with multiple sellers; some sellers may
misrepresent product quality to gain an advantage, such as having the platform
preferentially recommend their products to online users. To address this
challenge, we propose an algorithm, COBRA, for contextual bandit problems
involving strategic agents that disincentivize their strategic behavior without
using any monetary incentives, while having incentive compatibility and a
sub-linear regret guarantee. Our experimental results also validate the
different performance aspects of our proposed algorithm.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文研究了一个涉及多个智能体的上下文赌博机问题，其中学习者需要处理智能体可能虚报信息的行为。不同于现有假设智能体诚实报告的研究，现实场景中（如电商平台卖家可能夸大产品质量）常存在策略性欺骗。为此，作者提出了COBRA算法，无需金钱激励即可抑制策略性行为，同时保证激励相容性和次线性遗憾界。实验验证了算法的有效性。该研究为存在策略性智能体的推荐系统等场景提供了解决方案。（99字）
