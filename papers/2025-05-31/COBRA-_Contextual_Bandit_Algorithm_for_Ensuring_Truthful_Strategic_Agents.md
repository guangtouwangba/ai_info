# COBRA: Contextual Bandit Algorithm for Ensuring Truthful Strategic Agents

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23720v1

## 原始摘要

This paper considers a contextual bandit problem involving multiple agents,
where a learner sequentially observes the contexts and the agent's reported
arms, and then selects the arm that maximizes the system's overall reward.
Existing work in contextual bandits assumes that agents truthfully report their
arms, which is unrealistic in many real-life applications. For instance,
consider an online platform with multiple sellers; some sellers may
misrepresent product quality to gain an advantage, such as having the platform
preferentially recommend their products to online users. To address this
challenge, we propose an algorithm, COBRA, for contextual bandit problems
involving strategic agents that disincentivize their strategic behavior without
using any monetary incentives, while having incentive compatibility and a
sub-linear regret guarantee. Our experimental results also validate the
different performance aspects of our proposed algorithm.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文研究了一个涉及多个智能体的上下文赌博问题，提出了一种名为COBRA的算法。传统方法假设智能体会如实报告其选择，但现实中（如电商平台卖家可能虚报产品质量）存在策略性欺骗行为。COBRA算法无需货币激励即可抑制这种策略性行为，同时保证激励相容性和次线性遗憾界。实验验证了该算法的各项性能表现。该研究突破了现有上下文赌博算法对诚实报告的假设，为存在策略性操纵的实际应用场景提供了解决方案。
