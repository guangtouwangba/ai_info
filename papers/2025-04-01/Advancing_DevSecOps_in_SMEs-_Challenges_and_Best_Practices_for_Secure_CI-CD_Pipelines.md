# Advancing DevSecOps in SMEs: Challenges and Best Practices for Secure CI/CD Pipelines

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22612v1

## 原始摘要

This study evaluates the adoption of DevSecOps among small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs), identifying key challenges, best practices, and future
trends. Through a mixed methods approach backed by the Technology Acceptance
Model (TAM) and Diffusion of Innovations (DOI) theory, we analyzed survey data
from 405 SME professionals, revealing that while 68% have implemented
DevSecOps, adoption is hindered by technical complexity (41%), resource
constraints (35%), and cultural resistance (38%). Despite strong leadership
prioritization of security (73%), automation gaps persist, with only 12% of
organizations conducting security scans per commit.
  Our findings highlight a growing integration of security tools, particularly
API security (63%) and software composition analysis (62%), although container
security adoption remains low (34%). Looking ahead, SMEs anticipate artificial
intelligence and machine learning to significantly influence DevSecOps,
underscoring the need for proactive adoption of AI-driven security
enhancements. Based on our findings, this research proposes strategic best
practices to enhance CI/CD pipeline security including automation,
leadership-driven security culture, and cross-team collaboration.


## AI 摘要

该研究评估了中小企业DevSecOps的采用情况，发现68%的企业已实施，但面临技术复杂性（41%）、资源限制（35%）和文化阻力（38%）等挑战。尽管73%的企业领导重视安全，仅12%在每次提交时进行安全扫描。安全工具整合趋势明显，API安全（63%）和软件成分分析（62%）采用率高，但容器安全（34%）较低。未来，AI/ML预计将显著影响DevSecOps。研究建议通过自动化、领导驱动的安全文化和跨团队协作来加强CI/CD管道安全。
