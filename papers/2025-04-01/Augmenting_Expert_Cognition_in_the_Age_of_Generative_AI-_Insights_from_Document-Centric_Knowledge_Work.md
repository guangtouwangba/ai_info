# Augmenting Expert Cognition in the Age of Generative AI: Insights from Document-Centric Knowledge Work

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24334v1

## 原始摘要

As Generative AI (GenAI) capabilities expand, understanding how to preserve
and develop human expertise while leveraging AI's benefits becomes increasingly
critical. Through empirical studies in two contexts -- survey article authoring
in scholarly research and business document sensemaking -- we examine how
domain expertise shapes patterns of AI delegation and information processing
among knowledge workers. Our findings reveal that while experts welcome AI
assistance with repetitive information foraging tasks, they prefer to retain
control over complex synthesis and interpretation activities that require
nuanced domain understanding. We identify implications for designing GenAI
systems that support expert cognition. These include enabling selective
delegation aligned with expertise levels, preserving expert agency over
critical analytical tasks, considering varying levels of domain expertise in
system design, and supporting verification mechanisms that help users calibrate
their reliance while deepening expertise. We discuss the inherent tension
between reducing cognitive load through automation and maintaining the
deliberate practice necessary for expertise development. Lastly, we suggest
approaches for designing systems that provide metacognitive support, moving
beyond simple task automation toward actively supporting expertise development.
This work contributes to our understanding of how to design AI systems that
augment rather than diminish human expertise in document-centric workflows.


## AI 摘要

随着生成式AI能力的提升，如何在利用AI优势的同时保留和发展人类专业知识变得至关重要。研究通过学术调研写作和商业文档分析两个场景发现：专家欢迎AI协助重复性信息搜集，但倾向于掌控需要领域知识的复杂分析与解读工作。研究建议：1)按专业水平分配任务；2)保留专家对关键分析的控制权；3)系统设计需考虑专业差异；4)建立验证机制。研究揭示了自动化减轻认知负荷与保持专业发展所需刻意练习之间的张力，提出应设计支持元认知的系统，超越简单自动化，主动促进专业知识发展，实现人机协同增效。
