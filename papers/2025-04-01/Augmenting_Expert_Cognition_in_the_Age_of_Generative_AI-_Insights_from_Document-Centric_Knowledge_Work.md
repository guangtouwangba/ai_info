# Augmenting Expert Cognition in the Age of Generative AI: Insights from Document-Centric Knowledge Work

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24334v1

## 原始摘要

As Generative AI (GenAI) capabilities expand, understanding how to preserve
and develop human expertise while leveraging AI's benefits becomes increasingly
critical. Through empirical studies in two contexts -- survey article authoring
in scholarly research and business document sensemaking -- we examine how
domain expertise shapes patterns of AI delegation and information processing
among knowledge workers. Our findings reveal that while experts welcome AI
assistance with repetitive information foraging tasks, they prefer to retain
control over complex synthesis and interpretation activities that require
nuanced domain understanding. We identify implications for designing GenAI
systems that support expert cognition. These include enabling selective
delegation aligned with expertise levels, preserving expert agency over
critical analytical tasks, considering varying levels of domain expertise in
system design, and supporting verification mechanisms that help users calibrate
their reliance while deepening expertise. We discuss the inherent tension
between reducing cognitive load through automation and maintaining the
deliberate practice necessary for expertise development. Lastly, we suggest
approaches for designing systems that provide metacognitive support, moving
beyond simple task automation toward actively supporting expertise development.
This work contributes to our understanding of how to design AI systems that
augment rather than diminish human expertise in document-centric workflows.


## AI 摘要

随着生成式AI能力的提升，如何在利用AI优势的同时保持和发展人类专业知识变得至关重要。研究表明，专家乐于将重复性信息搜集任务委托给AI，但倾向于亲自处理需要领域知识的复杂分析与解释工作。这为AI系统设计提供了重要启示：应支持基于专业水平的选择性委托，保留专家对关键任务的控制权，考虑不同专业水平的用户需求，并提供验证机制帮助用户校准对AI的依赖。研究还探讨了自动化减轻认知负荷与保持专业发展所需刻意练习之间的平衡，建议设计能提供元认知支持、促进专业知识发展的AI系统。
