# Augmenting Expert Cognition in the Age of Generative AI: Insights from Document-Centric Knowledge Work

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24334v1

## 原始摘要

As Generative AI (GenAI) capabilities expand, understanding how to preserve
and develop human expertise while leveraging AI's benefits becomes increasingly
critical. Through empirical studies in two contexts -- survey article authoring
in scholarly research and business document sensemaking -- we examine how
domain expertise shapes patterns of AI delegation and information processing
among knowledge workers. Our findings reveal that while experts welcome AI
assistance with repetitive information foraging tasks, they prefer to retain
control over complex synthesis and interpretation activities that require
nuanced domain understanding. We identify implications for designing GenAI
systems that support expert cognition. These include enabling selective
delegation aligned with expertise levels, preserving expert agency over
critical analytical tasks, considering varying levels of domain expertise in
system design, and supporting verification mechanisms that help users calibrate
their reliance while deepening expertise. We discuss the inherent tension
between reducing cognitive load through automation and maintaining the
deliberate practice necessary for expertise development. Lastly, we suggest
approaches for designing systems that provide metacognitive support, moving
beyond simple task automation toward actively supporting expertise development.
This work contributes to our understanding of how to design AI systems that
augment rather than diminish human expertise in document-centric workflows.


## AI 摘要

随着生成式AI能力的增强，如何在利用AI优势的同时保持和发展人类专业知识变得至关重要。研究发现，专家乐于将重复性信息搜集任务委托给AI，但倾向于保留对需要领域理解的复杂分析与解释任务的控制权。研究建议AI系统设计应：1)根据专业水平实现选择性委托；2)保持专家对关键分析任务的主导权；3)考虑不同专业水平需求；4)支持验证机制以校准依赖程度。研究还探讨了自动化减轻认知负担与保持专业知识发展所需刻意练习之间的张力，提出系统应超越简单自动化，提供元认知支持以促进专业知识发展。
