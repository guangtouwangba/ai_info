# EQ-Negotiator: An Emotion-Reasoning LLM Agent in Credit Dialogues

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21080v3

## 原始摘要

While large language model (LLM)-based chatbots have been applied for
effective engagement in credit dialogues, their capacity for dynamic emotional
expression remains limited. Current agents primarily rely on passive empathy
rather than affective reasoning. For instance, when faced with persistent
client negativity, the agent should employ strategic emotional adaptation by
expressing measured anger to discourage counterproductive behavior and guide
the conversation toward resolution. This context-aware emotional modulation is
essential for imitating the nuanced decision-making of human negotiators. This
paper introduces an EQ-negotiator that combines emotion sensing from
pre-trained language models (PLMs) with emotional reasoning based on Game
Theory and Hidden Markov Models. It takes into account both the current and
historical emotions of the client to better manage and address negative
emotions during interactions. By fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs)
on public emotion datasets and validating them on the credit dialogue datasets,
our approach enables LLM-based agents to effectively capture shifts in client
emotions and dynamically adjust their response tone based on our emotion
decision policies in real-world financial negotiations. This EQ-negotiator can
also help credit agencies foster positive client relationships, enhancing
satisfaction in credit services.


## AI 摘要

该研究提出了一种结合情感感知与博弈论、隐马尔可夫模型情绪推理的EQ谈判助手（EQ-negotiator），旨在增强基于大语言模型（LLM）的信贷对话代理的动态情感表达能力。通过预训练语言模型（PLM）在公共情感数据集上的微调，并结合客户当前及历史情绪状态，该系统能实时捕捉情绪变化，并基于情感决策策略动态调整回应语气（如通过适度愤怒引导消极客户）。实验验证表明，该方法能有效管理负面情绪，模仿人类谈判者的细腻决策，提升信贷服务中的客户关系与满意度。
