# AI Literacy in K-12 and Higher Education in the Wake of Generative AI: An Integrative Review

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00079v3

## 原始摘要

Even though AI literacy has emerged as a prominent education topic in the
wake of generative AI, its definition remains vague. There is little consensus
among researchers and practitioners on how to discuss and design AI literacy
interventions. The term has been used to describe both learning activities that
train undergraduate students to use ChatGPT effectively and having kindergarten
children interact with social robots. This paper applies an integrative review
method to examine empirical and theoretical AI literacy studies published since
2020. In synthesizing the 124 reviewed studies, three ways to conceptualize
literacy-functional, critical, and indirectly beneficial-and three perspectives
on AI-technical detail, tool, and sociocultural-were identified, forming a
framework that reflects the spectrum of how AI literacy is approached in
practice. The framework highlights the need for more specialized terms within
AI literacy discourse and indicates research gaps in certain AI literacy
objectives.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文通过整合2020年以来的124项AI素养研究，提出了一个框架，将AI素养概念化为三种方式（功能性、批判性和间接有益性）和三种视角（技术细节、工具和社会文化）。研究发现，当前AI素养的定义模糊，应用范围广泛，从本科生使用ChatGPT到幼儿与社交机器人互动。框架揭示了AI素养讨论中需要更专业术语的迫切性，并指出某些AI素养目标存在研究空白。该研究为统一AI素养的理论和实践提供了基础，强调了进一步细化和填补研究空缺的必要性。
