# Using AI to Summarize US Presidential Campaign TV Advertisement Videos, 1952-2012

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22589v1

## 原始摘要

This paper introduces the largest and most comprehensive dataset of US
presidential campaign television advertisements, available in digital format.
The dataset also includes machine-searchable transcripts and high-quality
summaries designed to facilitate a variety of academic research. To date, there
has been great interest in collecting and analyzing US presidential campaign
advertisements, but the need for manual procurement and annotation led many to
rely on smaller subsets. We design a large-scale parallelized, AI-based
analysis pipeline that automates the laborious process of preparing,
transcribing, and summarizing videos. We then apply this methodology to the
9,707 presidential ads from the Julian P. Kanter Political Commercial Archive.
We conduct extensive human evaluations to show that these transcripts and
summaries match the quality of manually generated alternatives. We illustrate
the value of this data by including an application that tracks the genesis and
evolution of current focal issue areas over seven decades of presidential
elections. Our analysis pipeline and codebase also show how to use LLM-based
tools to obtain high-quality summaries for other video datasets.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文介绍了一个规模最大、内容最全面的美国总统竞选电视广告数字数据集，包含机器可搜索的文本转录和高质量摘要，便于学术研究。传统方法依赖人工收集和标注，导致样本量有限。作者开发了基于AI的并行分析流程，自动完成视频准备、转录和摘要生成，并应用于Kanter政治广告档案馆的9,707条总统竞选广告。人工评估证实其转录和摘要质量媲美人工结果。研究还展示了该数据在追踪70年间竞选焦点议题演变中的应用价值，同时为其他视频数据集提供了基于大语言模型的高质量摘要生成方案。
