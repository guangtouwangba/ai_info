# Challenges and Paths Towards AI for Software Engineering

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22625v1

## 原始摘要

AI for software engineering has made remarkable progress recently, becoming a
notable success within generative AI. Despite this, there are still many
challenges that need to be addressed before automated software engineering
reaches its full potential. It should be possible to reach high levels of
automation where humans can focus on the critical decisions of what to build
and how to balance difficult tradeoffs while most routine development effort is
automated away. Reaching this level of automation will require substantial
research and engineering efforts across academia and industry. In this paper,
we aim to discuss progress towards this in a threefold manner. First, we
provide a structured taxonomy of concrete tasks in AI for software engineering,
emphasizing the many other tasks in software engineering beyond code generation
and completion. Second, we outline several key bottlenecks that limit current
approaches. Finally, we provide an opinionated list of promising research
directions toward making progress on these bottlenecks, hoping to inspire
future research in this rapidly maturing field.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文探讨了AI在软件工程中的应用进展与挑战。尽管AI在代码生成和补全方面取得了显著成就，但要实现高度自动化仍需突破诸多瓶颈。作者从三方面展开讨论：首先，提出了AI软件工程任务的结构化分类，强调除代码生成外还有更多任务；其次，分析了当前方法的关键限制因素；最后，列出了有前景的研究方向，旨在激发未来研究。实现自动化需要学术界和工业界的共同努力，使人类能专注于关键决策，而将常规开发工作交由AI完成。
