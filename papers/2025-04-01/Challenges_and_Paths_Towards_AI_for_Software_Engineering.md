# Challenges and Paths Towards AI for Software Engineering

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22625v1

## 原始摘要

AI for software engineering has made remarkable progress recently, becoming a
notable success within generative AI. Despite this, there are still many
challenges that need to be addressed before automated software engineering
reaches its full potential. It should be possible to reach high levels of
automation where humans can focus on the critical decisions of what to build
and how to balance difficult tradeoffs while most routine development effort is
automated away. Reaching this level of automation will require substantial
research and engineering efforts across academia and industry. In this paper,
we aim to discuss progress towards this in a threefold manner. First, we
provide a structured taxonomy of concrete tasks in AI for software engineering,
emphasizing the many other tasks in software engineering beyond code generation
and completion. Second, we outline several key bottlenecks that limit current
approaches. Finally, we provide an opinionated list of promising research
directions toward making progress on these bottlenecks, hoping to inspire
future research in this rapidly maturing field.


## AI 摘要

AI在软件工程领域取得了显著进展，特别是在生成式AI方面。然而，要实现高度自动化仍面临诸多挑战，例如让人类专注于关键决策，而自动化处理常规开发任务。该领域需要学术界和工业界的共同努力。本文从三方面展开讨论：(1) 提出AI在软件工程中的任务分类，强调除代码生成外的其他任务；(2) 指出当前方法的主要瓶颈；(3) 列出有前景的研究方向，以推动领域发展。这些讨论旨在为这一快速成熟的领域提供研究启发。
