# CVE-Bench: A Benchmark for AI Agents' Ability to Exploit Real-World Web Application Vulnerabilities

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17332v1

## 原始摘要

Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of autonomously
conducting cyberattacks, posing significant threats to existing applications.
This growing risk highlights the urgent need for a real-world benchmark to
evaluate the ability of LLM agents to exploit web application vulnerabilities.
However, existing benchmarks fall short as they are limited to abstracted
Capture the Flag competitions or lack comprehensive coverage. Building a
benchmark for real-world vulnerabilities involves both specialized expertise to
reproduce exploits and a systematic approach to evaluating unpredictable
threats. To address this challenge, we introduce CVE-Bench, a real-world
cybersecurity benchmark based on critical-severity Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures. In CVE-Bench, we design a sandbox framework that enables LLM agents
to exploit vulnerable web applications in scenarios that mimic real-world
conditions, while also providing effective evaluation of their exploits. Our
evaluation shows that the state-of-the-art agent framework can resolve up to
13% of vulnerabilities.


## AI 摘要

随着大型语言模型(LLM)代理自主进行网络攻击的能力增强，现有应用面临重大威胁。针对缺乏真实漏洞评估基准的问题，研究者提出了CVE-Bench基准测试。该基准基于高危通用漏洞披露(CVE)，通过沙盒框架模拟真实环境，系统评估LLM代理利用Web应用漏洞的能力。测试表明，当前最先进的代理框架能成功利用13%的漏洞。该研究填补了现有基准局限于抽象竞赛或覆盖不全的缺陷，为评估不可预测的网络威胁提供了专业且系统的方法。
