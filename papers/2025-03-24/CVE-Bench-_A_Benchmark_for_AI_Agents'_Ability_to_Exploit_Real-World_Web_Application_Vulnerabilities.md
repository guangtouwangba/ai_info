# CVE-Bench: A Benchmark for AI Agents' Ability to Exploit Real-World Web Application Vulnerabilities

## 原始摘要

Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of autonomously
conducting cyberattacks, posing significant threats to existing applications.
This growing risk highlights the urgent need for a real-world benchmark to
evaluate the ability of LLM agents to exploit web application vulnerabilities.
However, existing benchmarks fall short as they are limited to abstracted
Capture the Flag competitions or lack comprehensive coverage. Building a
benchmark for real-world vulnerabilities involves both specialized expertise to
reproduce exploits and a systematic approach to evaluating unpredictable
threats. To address this challenge, we introduce CVE-Bench, a real-world
cybersecurity benchmark based on critical-severity Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures. In CVE-Bench, we design a sandbox framework that enables LLM agents
to exploit vulnerable web applications in scenarios that mimic real-world
conditions, while also providing effective evaluation of their exploits. Our
evaluation shows that the state-of-the-art agent framework can resolve up to
13% of vulnerabilities.


## AI 摘要

随着大型语言模型(LLM)代理自主发起网络攻击的能力增强，亟需建立真实漏洞评估基准。现有基准局限于抽象竞赛或覆盖不全。为此，研究者提出CVE-Bench基准，基于高危通用漏洞(CVE)，通过沙盒框架模拟真实环境，系统评估LLM代理的漏洞利用能力。该框架既能重现漏洞利用场景，又能有效评估代理行为。测试显示，当前最先进的代理框架能解决13%的漏洞。这一研究为评估LLM代理的网络安全威胁提供了重要工具，凸显了防范AI驱动网络攻击的紧迫性。(99字)
