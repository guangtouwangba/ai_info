# CVE-Bench: A Benchmark for AI Agents' Ability to Exploit Real-World Web Application Vulnerabilities

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17332v1

## 原始摘要

Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of autonomously
conducting cyberattacks, posing significant threats to existing applications.
This growing risk highlights the urgent need for a real-world benchmark to
evaluate the ability of LLM agents to exploit web application vulnerabilities.
However, existing benchmarks fall short as they are limited to abstracted
Capture the Flag competitions or lack comprehensive coverage. Building a
benchmark for real-world vulnerabilities involves both specialized expertise to
reproduce exploits and a systematic approach to evaluating unpredictable
threats. To address this challenge, we introduce CVE-Bench, a real-world
cybersecurity benchmark based on critical-severity Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures. In CVE-Bench, we design a sandbox framework that enables LLM agents
to exploit vulnerable web applications in scenarios that mimic real-world
conditions, while also providing effective evaluation of their exploits. Our
evaluation shows that the state-of-the-art agent framework can resolve up to
13% of vulnerabilities.


## AI 摘要

随着大型语言模型(LLM)代理自主进行网络攻击的能力增强，其威胁日益严重。现有基准测试存在局限，无法全面评估LLM代理利用真实漏洞的能力。为此，研究者提出了CVE-Bench基准测试，基于高危常见漏洞和暴露(CVE)，构建了模拟真实环境的沙盒框架，可评估LLM代理的漏洞利用能力。测试表明，当前最先进的代理框架能解决高达13%的漏洞。该研究为评估LLM代理的网络安全威胁提供了重要工具。
