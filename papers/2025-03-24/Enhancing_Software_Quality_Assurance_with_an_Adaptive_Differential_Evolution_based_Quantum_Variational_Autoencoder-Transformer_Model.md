## 原始摘要

An AI-powered quality engineering platform uses artificial intelligence to
boost software quality assessments through automated defect prediction and
optimized performance alongside improved feature extraction. Existing models
result in difficulties addressing noisy data types together with imbalances,
pattern recognition complexities, ineffective feature extraction, and
generalization weaknesses. To overcome those existing challenges in this
research, we develop a new model Adaptive Differential Evolution based Quantum
Variational Autoencoder-Transformer Model (ADE-QVAET), that combines a Quantum
Variational Autoencoder-Transformer (QVAET) to obtain high-dimensional latent
features and maintain sequential dependencies together with contextual
relationships, resulting in superior defect prediction accuracy. Adaptive
Differential Evolution (ADE) Optimization utilizes an adaptive parameter tuning
method that enhances model convergence and predictive performance. ADE-QVAET
integrates advanced AI techniques to create a robust solution for scalable and
accurate software defect prediction that represents a top-level AI-driven
technology for quality engineering applications. The proposed ADE-QVAET model
attains high accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score during the training
percentage (TP) 90 of 98.08%, 92.45%, 94.67%, and 98.12%.
