# GreenIQ: A Deep Search Platform for Comprehensive Carbon Market Analysis and Automated Report Generation

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16041v2

## 原始摘要

This study introduces GreenIQ, an AI-powered deep search platform designed to
revolutionise carbon market intelligence through autonomous analysis and
automated report generation. Carbon markets operate across diverse regulatory
landscapes, generating vast amounts of heterogeneous data from policy
documents, industry reports, academic literature, and real-time trading
platforms. Traditional research approaches remain labour-intensive, slow, and
difficult to scale. GreenIQ addresses these limitations through a multi-agent
architecture powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), integrating five
specialised AI agents: a Main Researcher Agent for intelligent information
retrieval, a Report Writing Agent for structured synthesis, a Final Reviewer
Agent for accuracy verification, a Data Visualisation Agent for enhanced
interpretability, and a Translator Agent for multilingual adaptation. The
system achieves seamless integration of structured and unstructured information
with AI-driven citation verification, ensuring high transparency and
reliability. GreenIQ delivers a 99.2\% reduction in processing time and a
99.7\% cost reduction compared to traditional research methodologies. A novel
AI persona-based evaluation framework involving 16 domain-specific AI personas
highlights its superior cross-jurisdictional analytical capabilities and
regulatory insight generation. GreenIQ sets new standards in AI-driven research
synthesis, policy analysis, and sustainability finance by streamlining carbon
market research. It offers an efficient and scalable framework for
environmental and financial intelligence, enabling more accurate, timely, and
cost-effective decision-making in complex regulatory landscapes
