# Strategic Decision-Making in Multi-Agent Domains: A Weighted Constrained Potential Dynamic Game Approach

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05876v3

## 原始摘要

In interactive multi-agent settings, decision-making and planning are
challenging mainly due to the agents' interconnected objectives. Dynamic game
theory offers a formal framework for analyzing such intricacies. Yet, solving
constrained dynamic games and determining the interaction outcome in the form
of generalized Nash Equilibria (GNE) pose computational challenges due to the
need for solving constrained coupled optimal control problems. In this paper,
we address this challenge by proposing to leverage the special structure of
many real-world multi-agent interactions. More specifically, our key idea is to
leverage constrained dynamic potential games, which are games for which GNE can
be found by solving a single constrained optimal control problem associated
with minimizing the potential function. We argue that constrained dynamic
potential games can effectively facilitate interactive decision-making in many
multi-agent interactions. We will identify structures in realistic multi-agent
interactive scenarios that can be transformed into weighted constrained
potential dynamic games (WCPDGs). We will show that the GNE of the resulting
WCPDG can be obtained by solving a single constrained optimal control problem.
We will demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through various
simulation studies and show that we achieve significant improvements in solve
time compared to state-of-the-art game solvers. We further provide experimental
validation of our proposed method in a navigation setup involving two
quadrotors carrying a rigid object while avoiding collisions with two humans.
