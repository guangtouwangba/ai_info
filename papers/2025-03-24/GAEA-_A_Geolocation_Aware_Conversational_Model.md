# GAEA: A Geolocation Aware Conversational Model

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16423v1

## 原始摘要

Image geolocalization, in which, traditionally, an AI model predicts the
precise GPS coordinates of an image is a challenging task with many downstream
applications. However, the user cannot utilize the model to further their
knowledge other than the GPS coordinate; the model lacks an understanding of
the location and the conversational ability to communicate with the user. In
recent days, with tremendous progress of large multimodal models (LMMs)
proprietary and open-source researchers have attempted to geolocalize images
via LMMs. However, the issues remain unaddressed; beyond general tasks, for
more specialized downstream tasks, one of which is geolocalization, LMMs
struggle. In this work, we propose to solve this problem by introducing a
conversational model GAEA that can provide information regarding the location
of an image, as required by a user. No large-scale dataset enabling the
training of such a model exists. Thus we propose a comprehensive dataset GAEA
with 800K images and around 1.6M question answer pairs constructed by
leveraging OpenStreetMap (OSM) attributes and geographical context clues. For
quantitative evaluation, we propose a diverse benchmark comprising 4K
image-text pairs to evaluate conversational capabilities equipped with diverse
question types. We consider 11 state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary
LMMs and demonstrate that GAEA significantly outperforms the best open-source
model, LLaVA-OneVision by 25.69% and the best proprietary model, GPT-4o by
8.28%. Our dataset, model and codes are available


## AI 摘要

<<<<<<< HEAD
图像地理定位传统上依赖于AI模型预测图像的精确GPS坐标，但这种方法缺乏对位置的理解和与用户的对话能力。随着大型多模态模型（LMMs）的进步，研究者尝试通过LMMs进行图像地理定位，但在专业任务中仍存在困难。本文提出了一种名为GAEA的对话模型，能够根据用户需求提供图像位置信息。由于缺乏大规模数据集，我们构建了包含80万张图像和160万问答对的GAEA数据集，利用OpenStreetMap属性和地理上下文线索。实验表明，GAEA在对话能力上显著优于现有开源和专有模型。
