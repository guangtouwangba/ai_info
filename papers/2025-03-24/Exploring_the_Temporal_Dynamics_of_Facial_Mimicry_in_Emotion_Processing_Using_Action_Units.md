# Exploring the Temporal Dynamics of Facial Mimicry in Emotion Processing Using Action Units

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17306v1

## 原始摘要

Facial mimicry - the automatic, unconscious imitation of others' expressions
- is vital for emotional understanding. This study investigates how mimicry
differs across emotions using Face Action Units from videos and participants'
responses. Dynamic Time Warping quantified the temporal alignment between
participants' and stimuli's facial expressions, revealing significant emotional
variations. Post-hoc tests indicated greater mimicry for 'Fear' than 'Happy'
and reduced mimicry for 'Anger' compared to 'Fear'. The mimicry correlations
with personality traits like Extraversion and Agreeableness were significant,
showcasing subtle yet meaningful connections. These findings suggest specific
emotions evoke stronger mimicry, with personality traits playing a secondary
role in emotional alignment. Notably, our results highlight how
personality-linked mimicry mechanisms extend beyond interpersonal communication
to affective computing applications, such as remote human-human interactions
and human-virtual-agent scenarios. Insights from temporal facial mimicry -
e.g., designing digital agents that adaptively mirror user expressions - enable
developers to create empathetic, personalized systems, enhancing emotional
resonance and user engagement.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了面部模仿（自动无意识模仿他人表情）在不同情绪间的差异。通过面部动作编码和动态时间规整分析，发现"恐惧"比"快乐"引发更强的模仿，而"愤怒"的模仿较弱。人格特质（外向性、宜人性）与模仿程度显著相关。这些发现表明特定情绪会引发不同程度的模仿，而人格特质起次要作用。研究结果对情感计算应用（如远程人际交互、人机虚拟互动）具有启示意义，例如设计能自适应模仿用户表情的数字代理，可增强系统共情能力，提升用户体验和情感共鸣。（99字）
