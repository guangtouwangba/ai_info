# HCAST: Human-Calibrated Autonomy Software Tasks

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17354v1

## 原始摘要

To understand and predict the societal impacts of highly autonomous AI
systems, we need benchmarks with grounding, i.e., metrics that directly connect
AI performance to real-world effects we care about. We present HCAST
(Human-Calibrated Autonomy Software Tasks), a benchmark of 189 machine learning
engineering, cybersecurity, software engineering, and general reasoning tasks.
We collect 563 human baselines (totaling over 1500 hours) from people skilled
in these domains, working under identical conditions as AI agents, which lets
us estimate that HCAST tasks take humans between one minute and 8+ hours.
Measuring the time tasks take for humans provides an intuitive metric for
evaluating AI capabilities, helping answer the question "can an agent be
trusted to complete a task that would take a human X hours?" We evaluate the
success rates of AI agents built on frontier foundation models, and we find
that current agents succeed 70-80% of the time on tasks that take humans less
than one hour, and less than 20% of the time on tasks that take humans more
than 4 hours.


## AI 摘要

研究人员开发了HCAST基准测试，包含189个机器学习、网络安全、软件工程和推理任务，并收集了563名专业人士（总计1500+小时）的人类表现基线。该测试通过对比人类与AI在相同条件下的任务完成时间，量化AI的可信度。结果显示，当前前沿AI模型在人类1小时内完成的任务中成功率70-80%，但在人类需4小时以上的任务中成功率不足20%。这一指标为评估AI的实用性和社会影响提供了直观依据。
