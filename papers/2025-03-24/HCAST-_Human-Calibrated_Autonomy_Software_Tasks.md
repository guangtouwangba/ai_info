# HCAST: Human-Calibrated Autonomy Software Tasks

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17354v1

## 原始摘要

To understand and predict the societal impacts of highly autonomous AI
systems, we need benchmarks with grounding, i.e., metrics that directly connect
AI performance to real-world effects we care about. We present HCAST
(Human-Calibrated Autonomy Software Tasks), a benchmark of 189 machine learning
engineering, cybersecurity, software engineering, and general reasoning tasks.
We collect 563 human baselines (totaling over 1500 hours) from people skilled
in these domains, working under identical conditions as AI agents, which lets
us estimate that HCAST tasks take humans between one minute and 8+ hours.
Measuring the time tasks take for humans provides an intuitive metric for
evaluating AI capabilities, helping answer the question "can an agent be
trusted to complete a task that would take a human X hours?" We evaluate the
success rates of AI agents built on frontier foundation models, and we find
that current agents succeed 70-80% of the time on tasks that take humans less
than one hour, and less than 20% of the time on tasks that take humans more
than 4 hours.


## AI 摘要

HCAST是一个包含189项机器学习、网络安全、软件工程和通用推理任务的基准测试，通过收集563名专业人士（总计1500+小时）在相同条件下完成这些任务的表现，建立了人类基线。研究发现，人类完成HCAST任务的时间从1分钟到8小时不等。当前基于前沿基础模型的AI代理在人类1小时内完成的任务上成功率约70-80%，但在人类需4小时以上的任务上成功率低于20%。该基准通过人类耗时这一直观指标，为评估AI能力提供了实用标准，帮助判断"AI能否完成人类需X小时的任务"。
