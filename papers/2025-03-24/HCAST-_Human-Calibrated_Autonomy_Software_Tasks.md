# HCAST: Human-Calibrated Autonomy Software Tasks

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17354v1

## 原始摘要

To understand and predict the societal impacts of highly autonomous AI
systems, we need benchmarks with grounding, i.e., metrics that directly connect
AI performance to real-world effects we care about. We present HCAST
(Human-Calibrated Autonomy Software Tasks), a benchmark of 189 machine learning
engineering, cybersecurity, software engineering, and general reasoning tasks.
We collect 563 human baselines (totaling over 1500 hours) from people skilled
in these domains, working under identical conditions as AI agents, which lets
us estimate that HCAST tasks take humans between one minute and 8+ hours.
Measuring the time tasks take for humans provides an intuitive metric for
evaluating AI capabilities, helping answer the question "can an agent be
trusted to complete a task that would take a human X hours?" We evaluate the
success rates of AI agents built on frontier foundation models, and we find
that current agents succeed 70-80% of the time on tasks that take humans less
than one hour, and less than 20% of the time on tasks that take humans more
than 4 hours.


## AI 摘要

研究人员开发了HCAST基准测试，包含189个涉及机器学习、网络安全、软件工程和通用推理的任务，并收集了563名专业人士（总计超1500小时）的人类表现数据。通过对比人类与AI在相同条件下的表现，发现当前前沿AI模型在耗时1小时以内的任务上成功率约70-80%，但在耗时4小时以上的复杂任务上成功率不足20%。该基准通过人类耗时这一直观指标，为评估AI能力提供了新方法，帮助判断"AI能否完成人类需要X小时的任务"。
