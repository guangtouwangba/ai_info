# HCAST: Human-Calibrated Autonomy Software Tasks

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17354v1

## 原始摘要

To understand and predict the societal impacts of highly autonomous AI
systems, we need benchmarks with grounding, i.e., metrics that directly connect
AI performance to real-world effects we care about. We present HCAST
(Human-Calibrated Autonomy Software Tasks), a benchmark of 189 machine learning
engineering, cybersecurity, software engineering, and general reasoning tasks.
We collect 563 human baselines (totaling over 1500 hours) from people skilled
in these domains, working under identical conditions as AI agents, which lets
us estimate that HCAST tasks take humans between one minute and 8+ hours.
Measuring the time tasks take for humans provides an intuitive metric for
evaluating AI capabilities, helping answer the question "can an agent be
trusted to complete a task that would take a human X hours?" We evaluate the
success rates of AI agents built on frontier foundation models, and we find
that current agents succeed 70-80% of the time on tasks that take humans less
than one hour, and less than 20% of the time on tasks that take humans more
than 4 hours.


## AI 摘要

研究人员开发了HCAST基准测试（人类校准自主软件任务），包含189个机器学习、网络安全、软件工程和通用推理任务。通过收集563名专业人士在相同条件下完成这些任务的数据（总计超1500小时），发现人类完成HCAST任务需要1分钟到8小时不等。该基准将AI性能与真实世界影响直接关联，用人类耗时作为直观评估指标。测试显示，当前前沿模型构建的AI代理在人类1小时内能完成的任务上成功率70-80%，但在人类需4小时以上的任务上成功率不足20%。这为评估AI可信度提供了量化依据。
