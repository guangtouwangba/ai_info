# HCAST: Human-Calibrated Autonomy Software Tasks

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17354v1

## 原始摘要

To understand and predict the societal impacts of highly autonomous AI
systems, we need benchmarks with grounding, i.e., metrics that directly connect
AI performance to real-world effects we care about. We present HCAST
(Human-Calibrated Autonomy Software Tasks), a benchmark of 189 machine learning
engineering, cybersecurity, software engineering, and general reasoning tasks.
We collect 563 human baselines (totaling over 1500 hours) from people skilled
in these domains, working under identical conditions as AI agents, which lets
us estimate that HCAST tasks take humans between one minute and 8+ hours.
Measuring the time tasks take for humans provides an intuitive metric for
evaluating AI capabilities, helping answer the question "can an agent be
trusted to complete a task that would take a human X hours?" We evaluate the
success rates of AI agents built on frontier foundation models, and we find
that current agents succeed 70-80% of the time on tasks that take humans less
than one hour, and less than 20% of the time on tasks that take humans more
than 4 hours.


## AI 摘要

为了理解和预测高度自主AI系统的社会影响，研究者提出了HCAST基准测试，包含189个机器学习、网络安全、软件工程和一般推理任务。通过收集563名领域专家的基线数据（总计超过1500小时），HCAST提供了人类完成这些任务的时间范围（1分钟至8小时以上）。基于此，研究者评估了前沿基础模型构建的AI代理的成功率，发现当前AI在人类耗时少于1小时的任务上成功率约为70-80%，而在人类耗时超过4小时的任务上成功率低于20%。这为评估AI能力提供了直观的指标。
