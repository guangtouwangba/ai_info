# HCAST: Human-Calibrated Autonomy Software Tasks

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17354v1

## 原始摘要

To understand and predict the societal impacts of highly autonomous AI
systems, we need benchmarks with grounding, i.e., metrics that directly connect
AI performance to real-world effects we care about. We present HCAST
(Human-Calibrated Autonomy Software Tasks), a benchmark of 189 machine learning
engineering, cybersecurity, software engineering, and general reasoning tasks.
We collect 563 human baselines (totaling over 1500 hours) from people skilled
in these domains, working under identical conditions as AI agents, which lets
us estimate that HCAST tasks take humans between one minute and 8+ hours.
Measuring the time tasks take for humans provides an intuitive metric for
evaluating AI capabilities, helping answer the question "can an agent be
trusted to complete a task that would take a human X hours?" We evaluate the
success rates of AI agents built on frontier foundation models, and we find
that current agents succeed 70-80% of the time on tasks that take humans less
than one hour, and less than 20% of the time on tasks that take humans more
than 4 hours.


## AI 摘要

为了理解和预测高度自主AI系统的社会影响，需要建立基于实际效果的基准。HCAST（人类校准的自主软件任务）是一个包含189个任务的基准，涵盖机器学习工程、网络安全、软件工程和一般推理。通过收集563名领域专家的基线数据，发现HCAST任务耗时从1分钟到8小时不等。通过测量人类完成任务的时间，可以直观评估AI能力。研究发现，当前基于前沿基础模型的AI在耗时少于1小时的任务上成功率达70-80%，而在耗时超过4小时的任务上成功率低于20%。
