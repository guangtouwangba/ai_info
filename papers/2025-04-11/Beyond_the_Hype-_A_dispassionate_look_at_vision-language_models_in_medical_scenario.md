# Beyond the Hype: A dispassionate look at vision-language models in medical scenario

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08704v2

## 原始摘要

Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, garnering significant attention
in AI communities. However, their performance and reliability in specialized
domains such as medicine remain insufficiently assessed. In particular, most
assessments over-concentrate on evaluating VLMs based on simple Visual Question
Answering (VQA) on multi-modality data, while ignoring the in-depth
characteristics of LVLMs. In this study, we introduce RadVUQA, a novel
Radiological Visual Understanding and Question Answering benchmark, to
comprehensively evaluate existing LVLMs. RadVUQA mainly validates LVLMs across
five dimensions: 1) Anatomical understanding, assessing the models' ability to
visually identify biological structures; 2) Multimodal comprehension, which
involves the capability of interpreting linguistic and visual instructions to
produce desired outcomes; 3) Quantitative and spatial reasoning, evaluating the
models' spatial awareness and proficiency in combining quantitative analysis
with visual and linguistic information; 4) Physiological knowledge, measuring
the models' capability to comprehend functions and mechanisms of organs and
systems; and 5) Robustness, which assesses the models' capabilities against
unharmonized and synthetic data. The results indicate that both generalized
LVLMs and medical-specific LVLMs have critical deficiencies with weak
multimodal comprehension and quantitative reasoning capabilities. Our findings
reveal the large gap between existing LVLMs and clinicians, highlighting the
urgent need for more robust and intelligent LVLMs. The code is available at

## AI 摘要

这篇论文介绍了RadVUQA基准测试，用于全面评估大型视觉语言模型(LVLMs)在医学放射学领域的表现。该测试从五个维度考察模型能力：1)解剖学理解；2)多模态理解；3)定量与空间推理；4)生理学知识；5)对不协调和合成数据的鲁棒性。研究发现，无论是通用LVLMs还是医学专用LVLMs都存在严重缺陷，特别是在多模态理解和定量推理方面表现薄弱。结果表明现有LVLMs与临床医生水平存在巨大差距，亟需开发更强大、更智能的模型。相关代码已开源。
