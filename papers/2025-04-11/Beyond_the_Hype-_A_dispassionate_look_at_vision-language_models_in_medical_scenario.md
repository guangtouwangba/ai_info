# Beyond the Hype: A dispassionate look at vision-language models in medical scenario

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08704v2

## 原始摘要

Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, garnering significant attention
in AI communities. However, their performance and reliability in specialized
domains such as medicine remain insufficiently assessed. In particular, most
assessments over-concentrate on evaluating VLMs based on simple Visual Question
Answering (VQA) on multi-modality data, while ignoring the in-depth
characteristics of LVLMs. In this study, we introduce RadVUQA, a novel
Radiological Visual Understanding and Question Answering benchmark, to
comprehensively evaluate existing LVLMs. RadVUQA mainly validates LVLMs across
five dimensions: 1) Anatomical understanding, assessing the models' ability to
visually identify biological structures; 2) Multimodal comprehension, which
involves the capability of interpreting linguistic and visual instructions to
produce desired outcomes; 3) Quantitative and spatial reasoning, evaluating the
models' spatial awareness and proficiency in combining quantitative analysis
with visual and linguistic information; 4) Physiological knowledge, measuring
the models' capability to comprehend functions and mechanisms of organs and
systems; and 5) Robustness, which assesses the models' capabilities against
unharmonized and synthetic data. The results indicate that both generalized
LVLMs and medical-specific LVLMs have critical deficiencies with weak
multimodal comprehension and quantitative reasoning capabilities. Our findings
reveal the large gap between existing LVLMs and clinicians, highlighting the
urgent need for more robust and intelligent LVLMs. The code is available at

## AI 摘要

近期大视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在通用任务中表现优异，但在医学等专业领域的能力尚未充分评估。研究团队提出RadVUQA基准测试，从五个维度系统评估LVLMs：1）解剖结构理解；2）多模态理解；3）定量与空间推理；4）生理知识；5）抗干扰能力。测试发现，无论是通用还是医疗专用LVLMs都存在显著缺陷，特别是多模态理解和定量推理能力薄弱。结果表明现有模型与临床医生水平存在巨大差距，亟需开发更鲁棒、智能的LVLMs。代码已开源。（99字）
