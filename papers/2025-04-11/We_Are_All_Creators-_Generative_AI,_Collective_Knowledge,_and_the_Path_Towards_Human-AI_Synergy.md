# We Are All Creators: Generative AI, Collective Knowledge, and the Path Towards Human-AI Synergy

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07936v1

## 原始摘要

Generative AI presents a profound challenge to traditional notions of human
uniqueness, particularly in creativity. Fueled by neural network based
foundation models, these systems demonstrate remarkable content generation
capabilities, sparking intense debates about authorship, copyright, and
intelligence itself. This paper argues that generative AI represents an
alternative form of intelligence and creativity, operating through mathematical
pattern synthesis rather than biological understanding or verbatim replication.
The fundamental differences between artificial and biological neural networks
reveal AI learning as primarily statistical pattern extraction from vast
datasets crystallized forms of collective human knowledge scraped from the
internet. This perspective complicates copyright theft narratives and
highlights practical challenges in attributing AI outputs to individual
sources. Rather than pursuing potentially futile legal restrictions, we
advocate for human AI synergy. By embracing generative AI as a complementary
tool alongside human intuition, context, and ethical judgment, society can
unlock unprecedented innovation, democratize creative expression, and address
complex challenges. This collaborative approach, grounded in realistic
understanding of AIs capabilities and limitations, offers the most promising
path forward. Additionally, recognizing these models as products of collective
human knowledge raises ethical questions about accessibility ensuring equitable
access to these tools could prevent widening societal divides and leverage
their full potential for collective benefit.


## AI 摘要

生成式AI对人类独特创造力提出深刻挑战，其基于神经网络的基础模型通过数学模式合成展现强大内容生成能力，而非生物理解或直接复制。AI学习本质是从海量人类集体知识数据中提取统计模式，这使版权归属复杂化。与其限制AI，不如推动人机协同：将AI作为补充工具，结合人类直觉、伦理判断和情境理解，以释放创新潜力并解决复杂问题。同时需认识到这些模型源自集体人类知识，应确保公平访问以避免社会分化，最大化集体利益。务实理解AI能力与局限是未来发展关键。
