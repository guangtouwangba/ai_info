# We Are All Creators: Generative AI, Collective Knowledge, and the Path Towards Human-AI Synergy

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07936v1

## 原始摘要

Generative AI presents a profound challenge to traditional notions of human
uniqueness, particularly in creativity. Fueled by neural network based
foundation models, these systems demonstrate remarkable content generation
capabilities, sparking intense debates about authorship, copyright, and
intelligence itself. This paper argues that generative AI represents an
alternative form of intelligence and creativity, operating through mathematical
pattern synthesis rather than biological understanding or verbatim replication.
The fundamental differences between artificial and biological neural networks
reveal AI learning as primarily statistical pattern extraction from vast
datasets crystallized forms of collective human knowledge scraped from the
internet. This perspective complicates copyright theft narratives and
highlights practical challenges in attributing AI outputs to individual
sources. Rather than pursuing potentially futile legal restrictions, we
advocate for human AI synergy. By embracing generative AI as a complementary
tool alongside human intuition, context, and ethical judgment, society can
unlock unprecedented innovation, democratize creative expression, and address
complex challenges. This collaborative approach, grounded in realistic
understanding of AIs capabilities and limitations, offers the most promising
path forward. Additionally, recognizing these models as products of collective
human knowledge raises ethical questions about accessibility ensuring equitable
access to these tools could prevent widening societal divides and leverage
their full potential for collective benefit.


## AI 摘要

生成式AI对传统的人类独特性观念（尤其是创造力）提出了深刻挑战。基于神经网络的基础模型展现出强大的内容生成能力，引发了关于著作权、版权和智能本质的激烈争论。本文认为生成式AI代表了一种新型的智能和创造力形式，其通过数学模式合成而非生物理解或机械复制运作。人工与生物神经网络的根本差异表明，AI学习本质是从海量数据中提取统计模式，这些数据结晶了来自互联网的集体人类知识。这种视角使版权盗窃的叙事复杂化，并凸显了追溯AI输出来源的实际困难。我们主张人机协同而非法律限制，通过将AI作为人类直觉、情境判断和伦理考量的补充工具，可以释放前所未有的创新潜力，实现创意表达的民主化。同时需确保这些集体知识产物的公平获取，以避免加剧社会分化。
