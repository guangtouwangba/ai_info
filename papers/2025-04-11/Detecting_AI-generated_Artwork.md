# Detecting AI-generated Artwork

## 原始摘要

The high efficiency and quality of artwork generated by Artificial
Intelligence (AI) has created new concerns and challenges for human artists. In
particular, recent improvements in generative AI have made it difficult for
people to distinguish between human-generated and AI-generated art. In this
research, we consider the potential utility of various types of Machine
Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models in distinguishing AI-generated
artwork from human-generated artwork. We focus on three challenging artistic
styles, namely, baroque, cubism, and expressionism. The learning models we test
are Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer
Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our best experimental
results yield a multiclass accuracy of 0.8208 over six classes, and an
impressive accuracy of 0.9758 for the binary classification problem of
distinguishing AI-generated from human-generated art.


## AI 摘要

人工智能（AI）生成的高质量艺术作品对人类艺术家构成新挑战。本研究探讨了机器学习（ML）和深度学习（DL）模型在区分AI与人类生成艺术作品的潜力，聚焦巴洛克、立体主义和表现主义三种复杂风格。测试了逻辑回归（LR）、支持向量机（SVM）、多层感知机（MLP）和卷积神经网络（CNN）等模型。实验结果显示，六分类任务准确率达0.8208，而区分AI与人类艺术的二分类准确率高达0.9758，表明这些模型在艺术鉴别中具有显著效果。
