# Dual Engines of Thoughts: A Depth-Breadth Integration Framework for Open-Ended Analysis

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07872v1

## 原始摘要

We propose the Dual Engines of Thoughts (DEoT), an analytical framework for
comprehensive open-ended reasoning. While traditional reasoning frameworks
primarily focus on finding "the best answer" or "the correct answer" for
single-answer problems, DEoT is specifically designed for "open-ended
questions," enabling both broader and deeper analytical exploration. The
framework centers on three key components: a Base Prompter for refining user
queries, a Solver Agent that orchestrates task decomposition, execution, and
validation, and a Dual-Engine System consisting of a Breadth Engine (to explore
diverse impact factors) and a Depth Engine (to perform deep investigations).
This integrated design allows DEoT to balance wide-ranging coverage with
in-depth analysis, and it is highly customizable, enabling users to adjust
analytical parameters and tool configurations based on specific requirements.
Experimental results show that DEoT excels in addressing complex, multi-faceted
questions, achieving a total win rate of 77-86% compared to existing reasoning
models, thus highlighting its effectiveness in real-world applications.


## AI 摘要

研究人员提出了"双重思维引擎"(DEoT)框架，专门用于解决开放性问题。该框架包含三个核心组件：基础提示器(优化用户查询)、求解代理(协调任务分解与验证)以及由广度引擎(探索多元因素)和深度引擎(深入分析)构成的双引擎系统。实验表明，DEoT在解决复杂多维度问题时表现优异，相比现有推理模型取得77-86%的胜率。其独特设计既能实现广泛覆盖又能深入分析，且支持用户根据需求自定义分析参数和工具配置，在现实应用中展现出显著优势。(99字)
