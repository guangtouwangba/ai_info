# Dual Engines of Thoughts: A Depth-Breadth Integration Framework for Open-Ended Analysis

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07872v1

## 原始摘要

We propose the Dual Engines of Thoughts (DEoT), an analytical framework for
comprehensive open-ended reasoning. While traditional reasoning frameworks
primarily focus on finding "the best answer" or "the correct answer" for
single-answer problems, DEoT is specifically designed for "open-ended
questions," enabling both broader and deeper analytical exploration. The
framework centers on three key components: a Base Prompter for refining user
queries, a Solver Agent that orchestrates task decomposition, execution, and
validation, and a Dual-Engine System consisting of a Breadth Engine (to explore
diverse impact factors) and a Depth Engine (to perform deep investigations).
This integrated design allows DEoT to balance wide-ranging coverage with
in-depth analysis, and it is highly customizable, enabling users to adjust
analytical parameters and tool configurations based on specific requirements.
Experimental results show that DEoT excels in addressing complex, multi-faceted
questions, achieving a total win rate of 77-86% compared to existing reasoning
models, thus highlighting its effectiveness in real-world applications.


## AI 摘要

本文提出"思维双引擎"(DEoT)框架，专门用于解决开放性问题。该框架包含三个核心组件：优化用户查询的基础提示器、协调任务分解/执行/验证的求解代理，以及由广度引擎(探索影响因素)和深度引擎(深入分析)构成的双引擎系统。DEoT能平衡广泛覆盖与深度分析，具有高度可定制性，允许调整分析参数和工具配置。实验表明，在解决复杂多面问题时，DEoT以77-86%的胜率优于现有推理模型，展现了实际应用优势。该框架突破了传统单答案推理的局限，实现了更全面的开放式分析。
