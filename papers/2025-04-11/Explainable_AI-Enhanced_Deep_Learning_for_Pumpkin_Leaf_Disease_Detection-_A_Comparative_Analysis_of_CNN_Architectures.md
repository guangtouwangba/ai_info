**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05449v2

## 原始摘要

Pumpkin leaf diseases are significant threats to agricultural productivity,
requiring a timely and precise diagnosis for effective management. Traditional
identification methods are laborious and susceptible to human error,
emphasizing the necessity for automated solutions. This study employs on the
"Pumpkin Leaf Disease Dataset", that comprises of 2000 high-resolution images
separated into five categories. Downy mildew, powdery mildew, mosaic disease,
bacterial leaf spot, and healthy leaves. The dataset was rigorously assembled
from several agricultural fields to ensure a strong representation for model
training. We explored many proficient deep learning architectures, including
DenseNet201, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, Xception, ResNet50, ResNet101 and
InceptionResNetV2, and observed that ResNet50 performed most effectively, with
an accuracy of 90.5% and comparable precision, recall, and F1-Score. We used
Explainable AI (XAI) approaches like Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, Score-CAM, and
Layer-CAM to provide meaningful representations of model decision-making
processes, which improved understanding and trust in automated disease
diagnostics. These findings demonstrate ResNet50's potential to revolutionize
pumpkin leaf disease detection, allowing for earlier and more accurate
treatments.


## AI 摘要

本研究利用包含2000张高清图像的南瓜叶病数据集，测试了多种深度学习模型对五种叶病（霜霉病、白粉病、花叶病、细菌性叶斑病及健康叶片）的分类性能。结果显示ResNet50模型表现最佳，准确率达90.5%。研究还采用Grad-CAM等可解释AI技术增强模型决策透明度。该自动化诊断方法相比传统人工检测更高效精准，有助于早期防治，对提升农业生产力具有重要意义。
