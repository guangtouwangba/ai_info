**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05449v2

## 原始摘要

Pumpkin leaf diseases are significant threats to agricultural productivity,
requiring a timely and precise diagnosis for effective management. Traditional
identification methods are laborious and susceptible to human error,
emphasizing the necessity for automated solutions. This study employs on the
"Pumpkin Leaf Disease Dataset", that comprises of 2000 high-resolution images
separated into five categories. Downy mildew, powdery mildew, mosaic disease,
bacterial leaf spot, and healthy leaves. The dataset was rigorously assembled
from several agricultural fields to ensure a strong representation for model
training. We explored many proficient deep learning architectures, including
DenseNet201, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, Xception, ResNet50, ResNet101 and
InceptionResNetV2, and observed that ResNet50 performed most effectively, with
an accuracy of 90.5% and comparable precision, recall, and F1-Score. We used
Explainable AI (XAI) approaches like Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, Score-CAM, and
Layer-CAM to provide meaningful representations of model decision-making
processes, which improved understanding and trust in automated disease
diagnostics. These findings demonstrate ResNet50's potential to revolutionize
pumpkin leaf disease detection, allowing for earlier and more accurate
treatments.


## AI 摘要

南瓜叶病害严重影响农业生产，传统检测方法费时且易出错，亟需自动化解决方案。本研究使用包含2000张高分辨率图像的"南瓜叶病害数据集"，涵盖霜霉病、白粉病、花叶病、细菌性叶斑病和健康叶片五类。通过测试多种深度学习模型（如DenseNet、Xception、ResNet等），发现ResNet50表现最佳，准确率达90.5%。研究还采用可解释AI技术（Grad-CAM等）增强模型决策透明度。结果表明，ResNet50能有效提升南瓜叶病害的早期精准诊断，为农业病害管理提供可靠工具。
