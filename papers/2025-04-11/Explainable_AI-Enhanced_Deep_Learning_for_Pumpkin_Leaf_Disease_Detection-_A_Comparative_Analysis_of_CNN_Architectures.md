**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05449v2

## 原始摘要

Pumpkin leaf diseases are significant threats to agricultural productivity,
requiring a timely and precise diagnosis for effective management. Traditional
identification methods are laborious and susceptible to human error,
emphasizing the necessity for automated solutions. This study employs on the
"Pumpkin Leaf Disease Dataset", that comprises of 2000 high-resolution images
separated into five categories. Downy mildew, powdery mildew, mosaic disease,
bacterial leaf spot, and healthy leaves. The dataset was rigorously assembled
from several agricultural fields to ensure a strong representation for model
training. We explored many proficient deep learning architectures, including
DenseNet201, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, Xception, ResNet50, ResNet101 and
InceptionResNetV2, and observed that ResNet50 performed most effectively, with
an accuracy of 90.5% and comparable precision, recall, and F1-Score. We used
Explainable AI (XAI) approaches like Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, Score-CAM, and
Layer-CAM to provide meaningful representations of model decision-making
processes, which improved understanding and trust in automated disease
diagnostics. These findings demonstrate ResNet50's potential to revolutionize
pumpkin leaf disease detection, allowing for earlier and more accurate
treatments.


## AI 摘要

本研究利用包含2000张高清南瓜叶片图像的"南瓜叶病数据集"，采用多种深度学习模型进行病害识别。实验发现ResNet50表现最优，准确率达90.5%。研究还应用Grad-CAM等可解释AI技术，增强了模型决策过程的可理解性。结果表明，ResNet50能有效识别霜霉病、白粉病等五种叶部病害，为农业病害的早期精准诊断提供了自动化解决方案，显著优于传统人工识别方法。该技术有望提升病害管理效率，推动智慧农业发展。
