# Towards Sustainable Creativity Support: An Exploratory Study on Prompt Based Image Generation

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07879v1

## 原始摘要

Creativity is a valuable human skill that has long been augmented through
both analog and digital tools. Recent progress in generative AI, such as image
generation, provides a disruptive technological solution to supporting human
creativity further and helping humans generate solutions faster. While AI image
generators can help to rapidly visualize ideas based on user prompts, the use
of such AI systems has also been critiqued due to their considerable energy
usage. In this paper, we report on a user study (N = 24) to understand whether
energy consumption can be reduced without impeding on the tool's perceived
creativity support. Our results highlight that, for example, a main effect of
(image generation) condition on energy consumption, and index of creativity
support per prompt but not per task, which seem mainly attributed to image
quantity per prompt. We provide details of our analysis on the relation between
energy usage, creativity support, and prompting behavior, including attitudes
towards designing with AI and its environmental impact.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文探讨了生成式AI（如图像生成器）在支持人类创造力方面的作用及其能耗问题。研究通过用户实验（N=24）发现，AI图像生成器的能耗可以通过调整生成条件显著降低，而不会明显影响用户感知的创造力支持。结果显示，能耗和创造力支持指数与每提示生成的图像数量相关，而非任务整体。研究还分析了能耗、创造力支持和用户提示行为之间的关系，包括用户对AI设计及其环境影响的态度。这表明在保持创造力支持的同时，优化AI系统以减少能耗是可行的。
