# Quantifying the Spread of Online Incivility in Brazilian Politics

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08960v2

## 原始摘要

Incivility refers to behaviors that violate collective norms and disrupt
cooperation within the political process. Although large-scale online data and
automated techniques have enabled the quantitative analysis of uncivil
discourse, prior research has predominantly focused on impoliteness or
toxicity, often overlooking other behaviors that undermine democratic values.
To address this gap, we propose a multidimensional conceptual framework
encompassing Impoliteness, Physical Harm and Violent Political Rhetoric, Hate
Speech and Stereotyping, and Threats to Democratic Institutions and Values.
Using this framework, we measure the spread of online political incivility in
Brazil using approximately 5 million tweets posted by 2,307 political
influencers during the 2022 Brazilian general election. Through statistical
modeling and network analysis, we examine the dynamics of uncivil posts at
different election stages, identify key disseminators and audiences, and
explore the mechanisms driving the spread of uncivil information online. Our
findings indicate that impoliteness is more likely to surge during election
campaigns. In contrast, the other dimensions of incivility are often triggered
by specific violent events. Moreover, we find that left-aligned individual
influencers are the primary disseminators of online incivility in the Brazilian
Twitter/X sphere and that they disseminate not only direct incivility but also
indirect incivility when discussing or opposing incivility expressed by others.
They relay those content from politicians, media agents, and individuals to
reach broader audiences, revealing a diffusion pattern mixing the direct and
two-step flows of communication theory. This study offers new insights into the
multidimensional nature of incivility in Brazilian politics and provides a
conceptual framework that can be extended to other political contexts.


## AI 摘要

该研究提出了一个多维框架分析政治不文明行为，包括不礼貌、暴力言论、仇恨言论和对民主制度的威胁。通过分析2022年巴西大选期间2307名政治影响者的500万条推文，研究发现：选举期间不礼貌行为激增，其他不文明行为则由暴力事件触发；左翼个人影响者是主要传播者，既传播直接不文明内容，也通过讨论他人言论传播间接不文明内容；传播模式混合了直接传播和两步传播理论。研究为理解巴西政治不文明行为提供了新视角，其框架也可应用于其他政治背景。
