# ProME: An Integrated Computational Platform for Material Properties at Extremes and Its Application in Multicomponent Alloy Design

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06194v1

## 原始摘要

We have built an integrated computational platform for material properties at
extreme conditions, ProME (Professional Materials at Extremes) v1.0, which
enables integrated calculations for multicomponent alloys, covering high
temperatures up to tens of thousands of Kelvin, high pressures up to millions
of atmospheres, and high strain rates up to millions per second. A series of
software packages have been developed and integrated into ProME v1.0, including
ABC (AI-Based Crystal search) for crystal structure search under pressure, SAE
(Similar Atomic Environment) for disordered configuration modeling, MFP$^2$
(Multiphase Fast Previewer by Mean-Field Potential) for multiphase
thermodynamic properties, HTEM (High-throughput Toolkit for Elasticity
Modeling) for thermo-elastic properties, TREX (TRansport at Extremes) for
electrical and thermal conductivity, Hippos (High plastic phase model software)
for phase-field simulation of microstructure evolution under high strain rates,
and AutoCalphad for modeling and optimization of phase diagrams with variable
compositions. ProME v1.0 has been applied to design the composition of the
quaternary alloys Platinum-Iridium-Aluminum-Chromium (Pt-Ir-Al-Cr) for engine
nozzles of aerospace attitude-orbit control, achieving high-temperature
strength comparable to the currently used Pt-Ir alloys but with significantly
reduced costs for raw materials. ProME offers crucial support for advancing
both fundamental scientific understanding and industrial innovation in
materials research and development.


## AI 摘要

ProME v1.0是一个集成计算平台，用于极端条件下的材料性能研究，涵盖高温（数万开尔文）、高压（数百万大气压）和高应变率（每秒数百万次）。它整合了多个软件包，支持多组分合金的晶体结构搜索、无序构型建模、热力学性质预测、弹性性能分析、电热导率计算、高应变率微观结构演化模拟以及相图优化。该平台已成功应用于航天发动机喷嘴用铂-铱-铝-铬四元合金设计，在保持高温强度的同时显著降低原材料成本。ProME为材料研发的基础科学和工业创新提供了关键支持。
