# ProME: An Integrated Computational Platform for Material Properties at Extremes and Its Application in Multicomponent Alloy Design

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06194v1

## 原始摘要

We have built an integrated computational platform for material properties at
extreme conditions, ProME (Professional Materials at Extremes) v1.0, which
enables integrated calculations for multicomponent alloys, covering high
temperatures up to tens of thousands of Kelvin, high pressures up to millions
of atmospheres, and high strain rates up to millions per second. A series of
software packages have been developed and integrated into ProME v1.0, including
ABC (AI-Based Crystal search) for crystal structure search under pressure, SAE
(Similar Atomic Environment) for disordered configuration modeling, MFP$^2$
(Multiphase Fast Previewer by Mean-Field Potential) for multiphase
thermodynamic properties, HTEM (High-throughput Toolkit for Elasticity
Modeling) for thermo-elastic properties, TREX (TRansport at Extremes) for
electrical and thermal conductivity, Hippos (High plastic phase model software)
for phase-field simulation of microstructure evolution under high strain rates,
and AutoCalphad for modeling and optimization of phase diagrams with variable
compositions. ProME v1.0 has been applied to design the composition of the
quaternary alloys Platinum-Iridium-Aluminum-Chromium (Pt-Ir-Al-Cr) for engine
nozzles of aerospace attitude-orbit control, achieving high-temperature
strength comparable to the currently used Pt-Ir alloys but with significantly
reduced costs for raw materials. ProME offers crucial support for advancing
both fundamental scientific understanding and industrial innovation in
materials research and development.


## AI 摘要

研究团队开发了极端条件下材料性能集成计算平台ProME v1.0，可计算多元合金在超高温（数万开尔文）、超高压（百万大气压）及超高应变率（百万/秒）下的性能。该平台整合了晶体结构搜索（ABC）、无序构型建模（SAE）、多相热力学（MFP²）、热弹性（HTEM）、输运特性（TREX）、高应变相场模拟（Hippos）及相图优化（AutoCalphad）等模块。应用案例显示，ProME成功设计了航天发动机喷嘴用Pt-Ir-Al-Cr四元合金，在保持高温强度的同时显著降低成本。该平台为材料研发提供了从基础研究到工业创新的关键支持。
