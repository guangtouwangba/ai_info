# ProME: An Integrated Computational Platform for Material Properties at Extremes and Its Application in Multicomponent Alloy Design

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06194v1

## 原始摘要

We have built an integrated computational platform for material properties at
extreme conditions, ProME (Professional Materials at Extremes) v1.0, which
enables integrated calculations for multicomponent alloys, covering high
temperatures up to tens of thousands of Kelvin, high pressures up to millions
of atmospheres, and high strain rates up to millions per second. A series of
software packages have been developed and integrated into ProME v1.0, including
ABC (AI-Based Crystal search) for crystal structure search under pressure, SAE
(Similar Atomic Environment) for disordered configuration modeling, MFP$^2$
(Multiphase Fast Previewer by Mean-Field Potential) for multiphase
thermodynamic properties, HTEM (High-throughput Toolkit for Elasticity
Modeling) for thermo-elastic properties, TREX (TRansport at Extremes) for
electrical and thermal conductivity, Hippos (High plastic phase model software)
for phase-field simulation of microstructure evolution under high strain rates,
and AutoCalphad for modeling and optimization of phase diagrams with variable
compositions. ProME v1.0 has been applied to design the composition of the
quaternary alloys Platinum-Iridium-Aluminum-Chromium (Pt-Ir-Al-Cr) for engine
nozzles of aerospace attitude-orbit control, achieving high-temperature
strength comparable to the currently used Pt-Ir alloys but with significantly
reduced costs for raw materials. ProME offers crucial support for advancing
both fundamental scientific understanding and industrial innovation in
materials research and development.


## AI 摘要

研究团队开发了集成计算平台ProME v1.0，用于极端条件下材料性能的多尺度模拟。该平台整合了8个功能模块，可计算万开尔文高温、百万大气压高压和百万/秒高应变率条件下多元合金的热力学、弹性、输运等性质及微观结构演化。应用该平台设计的Pt-Ir-Al-Cr四元合金，在保持与现用Pt-Ir合金相当高温强度的同时显著降低了成本。ProME为极端条件材料研发提供了从基础研究到工业创新的全链条计算支持，特别适用于航空航天发动机喷嘴等关键部件的材料设计。
