# Neuro-Symbolic Concepts

## 原始摘要

This article presents a concept-centric paradigm for building agents that can
learn continually and reason flexibly. The concept-centric agent utilizes a
vocabulary of neuro-symbolic concepts. These concepts, such as object,
relation, and action concepts, are grounded on sensory inputs and actuation
outputs. They are also compositional, allowing for the creation of novel
concepts through their structural combination. To facilitate learning and
reasoning, the concepts are typed and represented using a combination of
symbolic programs and neural network representations. Leveraging such
neuro-symbolic concepts, the agent can efficiently learn and recombine them to
solve various tasks across different domains, ranging from 2D images, videos,
3D scenes, and robotic manipulation tasks. This concept-centric framework
offers several advantages, including data efficiency, compositional
generalization, continual learning, and zero-shot transfer.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种以概念为中心的智能体构建范式，通过神经符号概念（如物体、关系和动作概念）实现持续学习和灵活推理。这些概念基于感知输入和动作输出，具有组合性，可通过结构组合创造新概念。概念采用符号程序与神经网络结合的表征方式，支持高效学习和重组，适用于2D图像、视频、3D场景和机器人操作等多领域任务。该框架具有数据高效性、组合泛化能力、持续学习优势和零样本迁移特性。
