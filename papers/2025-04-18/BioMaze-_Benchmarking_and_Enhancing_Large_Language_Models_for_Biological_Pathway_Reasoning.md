# BioMaze: Benchmarking and Enhancing Large Language Models for Biological Pathway Reasoning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16660v4

## 原始摘要

The applications of large language models (LLMs) in various biological
domains have been explored recently, but their reasoning ability in complex
biological systems, such as pathways, remains underexplored, which is crucial
for predicting biological phenomena, formulating hypotheses, and designing
experiments. This work explores the potential of LLMs in pathway reasoning. We
introduce BioMaze, a dataset with 5.1K complex pathway problems derived from
real research, covering various biological contexts including natural dynamic
changes, disturbances, additional intervention conditions, and multi-scale
research targets. Our evaluation of methods such as CoT and graph-augmented
reasoning, shows that LLMs struggle with pathway reasoning, especially in
perturbed systems. To address this, we propose PathSeeker, an LLM agent that
enhances reasoning through interactive subgraph-based navigation, enabling a
more effective approach to handling the complexities of biological systems in a
scientifically aligned manner. The dataset and code are available at

## AI 摘要

这篇论文探讨了大语言模型（LLM）在生物通路推理中的应用，发现现有模型在复杂生物系统（如受干扰的通路）中表现欠佳。研究者提出了BioMaze数据集，包含5.1K个基于真实研究的通路问题，涵盖动态变化、干扰、干预条件和多尺度目标等场景。测试显示现有方法（如思维链和图增强推理）效果有限，因此开发了PathSeeker——一个通过交互式子图导航增强推理的LLM智能体，能更有效处理生物系统复杂性。数据集和代码已开源。研究揭示了LLM在生物通路推理中的潜力与挑战。
