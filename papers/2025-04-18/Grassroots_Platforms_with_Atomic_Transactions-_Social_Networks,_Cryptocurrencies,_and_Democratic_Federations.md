# Grassroots Platforms with Atomic Transactions: Social Networks, Cryptocurrencies, and Democratic Federations

## 原始摘要

Grassroots platforms aim to offer an egalitarian alternative to global
platforms. Whereas global platforms can have only a single instance, grassroots
platforms can have multiple instances that emerge and operate independently of
each other and of any global resource except the network, and can interoperate
and coalesce into ever-larger instances once interconnected. Key grassroots
platforms include grassroots social networks, grassroots cryptocurrencies, and
grassroots democratic federations. Previously, grassroots platforms were
defined formally and proven grassroots using unary distributed transition
systems, in which each transition is carried out by a single agent. However,
grassroots platforms cater for a more abstract specification using transactions
carried out atomically by multiple agents, something that cannot be expressed
by unary transition systems. As a result, their original specifications and
proofs were unnecessarily cumbersome and opaque.
  We enhance the notion of a distributed transition system to include atomic
transactions and revisit the notion of grassroots platforms within this new
foundation; present crisp specifications of key grassroots platforms using
atomic transactions: befriending and defriending for grassroots social
networks, coin swaps for grassroots cryptocurrencies, and communities forming,
joining, and leaving a federation for grassroots democratic federations; prove
a general theorem that a platform specified by atomic transactions that are
so-called interactive is grassroots; show that the atomic transactions used to
specify all three platforms are interactive; and conclude that the platforms
thus specified are indeed grassroots. We thus provide a crisp mathematical
foundation for grassroots platforms and a solid and clear starting point from
which their implementation can commence.


## AI 摘要

本文改进了分布式过渡系统的概念，引入原子事务（多代理协同操作）来重新定义草根平台。相比之前只能处理单代理操作的一元过渡系统，新框架能更简洁地表达草根社交网络（好友管理）、草根加密货币（币种交换）和草根民主联盟（社区管理）的关键操作。作者证明：只要平台规范使用"交互式"原子事务，就具有草根性。研究为草根平台建立了清晰的数学基础，验证了三大典型平台的草根属性，为其实现提供了可靠的理论起点。新方法克服了原有规范冗长晦涩的缺陷。
