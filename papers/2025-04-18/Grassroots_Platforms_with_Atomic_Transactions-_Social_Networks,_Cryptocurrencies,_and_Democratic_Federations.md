# Grassroots Platforms with Atomic Transactions: Social Networks, Cryptocurrencies, and Democratic Federations

## 原始摘要

Grassroots platforms aim to offer an egalitarian alternative to global
platforms. Whereas global platforms can have only a single instance, grassroots
platforms can have multiple instances that emerge and operate independently of
each other and of any global resource except the network, and can interoperate
and coalesce into ever-larger instances once interconnected. Key grassroots
platforms include grassroots social networks, grassroots cryptocurrencies, and
grassroots democratic federations. Previously, grassroots platforms were
defined formally and proven grassroots using unary distributed transition
systems, in which each transition is carried out by a single agent. However,
grassroots platforms cater for a more abstract specification using transactions
carried out atomically by multiple agents, something that cannot be expressed
by unary transition systems. As a result, their original specifications and
proofs were unnecessarily cumbersome and opaque.
  We enhance the notion of a distributed transition system to include atomic
transactions and revisit the notion of grassroots platforms within this new
foundation; present crisp specifications of key grassroots platforms using
atomic transactions: befriending and defriending for grassroots social
networks, coin swaps for grassroots cryptocurrencies, and communities forming,
joining, and leaving a federation for grassroots democratic federations; prove
a general theorem that a platform specified by atomic transactions that are
so-called interactive is grassroots; show that the atomic transactions used to
specify all three platforms are interactive; and conclude that the platforms
thus specified are indeed grassroots. We thus provide a crisp mathematical
foundation for grassroots platforms and a solid and clear starting point from
which their implementation can commence.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种改进的分布式过渡系统，引入原子事务来更简洁地定义和验证基层平台（如去中心化社交网络、加密货币和民主联盟）。原方法使用单代理过渡系统导致规范繁琐，新方法支持多代理原子事务，能更清晰地描述平台核心操作（如好友管理、代币交换、联盟动态）。作者证明：只要平台事务满足"交互性"，就具备基层特性，并验证了三种平台均符合该条件。这为基层平台提供了严谨的数学基础，为其实现奠定了明确的理论框架。
