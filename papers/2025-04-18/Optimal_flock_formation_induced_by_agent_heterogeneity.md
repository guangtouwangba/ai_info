# Optimal flock formation induced by agent heterogeneity

## 原始摘要

The study of flocking in biological systems has identified conditions for
self-organized collective behavior, inspiring the development of decentralized
strategies to coordinate the dynamics of swarms of drones and other autonomous
vehicles. Previous research has focused primarily on the role of the
time-varying interaction network among agents while assuming that the agents
themselves are identical or nearly identical. Here, we depart from this
conventional assumption to investigate how inter-individual differences between
agents affect the stability and convergence in flocking dynamics. We show that
flocks of agents with optimally assigned heterogeneous parameters significantly
outperform their homogeneous counterparts, achieving 20-40% faster convergence
to desired formations across various control tasks. These tasks include target
tracking, flock formation, and obstacle maneuvering. In systems with
communication delays, heterogeneity can enable convergence even when flocking
is unstable for identical agents. Our results challenge existing paradigms in
multi-agent control and establish system disorder as an adaptive, distributed
mechanism to promote collective behavior in flocking dynamics.

该研究挑战了群体行为中个体同质性的传统假设，发现参数优化分配的异质性群体比同质群体表现更优。实验表明，异质性群体在目标追踪、编队形成和障碍规避等任务中，收敛速度提升20-40%。在存在通信延迟时，异质性甚至能实现同质群体无法达成的稳定收敛。研究揭示了系统无序性可作为促进群体行为的自适应分布式机制，为无人机群等自主系统的协同控制提供了新思路，表明个体差异能显著提升群体动态的稳定性和收敛效率。
