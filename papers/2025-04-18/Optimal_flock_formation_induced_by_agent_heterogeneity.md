# Optimal flock formation induced by agent heterogeneity

## 原始摘要

The study of flocking in biological systems has identified conditions for
self-organized collective behavior, inspiring the development of decentralized
strategies to coordinate the dynamics of swarms of drones and other autonomous
vehicles. Previous research has focused primarily on the role of the
time-varying interaction network among agents while assuming that the agents
themselves are identical or nearly identical. Here, we depart from this
conventional assumption to investigate how inter-individual differences between
agents affect the stability and convergence in flocking dynamics. We show that
flocks of agents with optimally assigned heterogeneous parameters significantly
outperform their homogeneous counterparts, achieving 20-40% faster convergence
to desired formations across various control tasks. These tasks include target
tracking, flock formation, and obstacle maneuvering. In systems with
communication delays, heterogeneity can enable convergence even when flocking
is unstable for identical agents. Our results challenge existing paradigms in
multi-agent control and establish system disorder as an adaptive, distributed
mechanism to promote collective behavior in flocking dynamics.


## AI 摘要

传统群体行为研究通常假设个体同质化，而本研究突破性地探讨了异质性个体对群体动态的影响。研究发现，参数优化分配的异质智能体群体比同质群体表现更优，在目标追踪、编队形成和障碍规避等任务中收敛速度提升20-40%。特别值得注意的是，在存在通信延迟的系统中，异质性能使群体保持稳定收敛，而同质群体则可能失稳。这一发现挑战了多智能体控制的传统范式，揭示了系统无序性可作为促进群体行为的自适应分布式机制。研究为无人机群等自主系统的协调控制提供了新思路。
