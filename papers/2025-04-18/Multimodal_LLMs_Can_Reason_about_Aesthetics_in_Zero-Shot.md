# Multimodal LLMs Can Reason about Aesthetics in Zero-Shot

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09012v2

## 原始摘要

The rapid progress of generative art has democratized the creation of
visually pleasing imagery. However, achieving genuine artistic impact - the
kind that resonates with viewers on a deeper, more meaningful level - requires
a sophisticated aesthetic sensibility. This sensibility involves a
multi-faceted reasoning process extending beyond mere visual appeal, which is
often overlooked by current computational models. This paper pioneers an
approach to capture this complex process by investigating how the reasoning
capabilities of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) can be effectively elicited for
aesthetic judgment. Our analysis reveals a critical challenge: MLLMs exhibit a
tendency towards hallucinations during aesthetic reasoning, characterized by
subjective opinions and unsubstantiated artistic interpretations. We further
demonstrate that these limitations can be overcome by employing an
evidence-based, objective reasoning process, as substantiated by our proposed
baseline, ArtCoT. MLLMs prompted by this principle produce multi-faceted and
in-depth aesthetic reasoning that aligns significantly better with human
judgment. These findings have direct applications in areas such as AI art
tutoring and as reward models for generative art. Ultimately, our work paves
the way for AI systems that can truly understand, appreciate, and generate
artworks that align with the sensible human aesthetic standard.


## AI 摘要

当前生成艺术快速发展，但真正具有艺术感染力的作品需要超越视觉吸引力的多维度审美推理。研究发现，多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在进行美学判断时容易出现主观臆断和缺乏依据的"幻觉"问题。通过采用基于证据的客观推理框架ArtCoT，可显著提升模型的美学分析能力，使其产出更符合人类审美标准的深度评价。该成果可应用于AI艺术教学和生成艺术奖励模型开发，为构建真正理解人类审美的AI系统奠定基础。研究揭示了提升AI艺术鉴赏能力的关键在于建立系统化的客观推理机制。
