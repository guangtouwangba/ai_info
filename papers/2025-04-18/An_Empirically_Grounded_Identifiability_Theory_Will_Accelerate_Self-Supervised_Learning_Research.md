# An Empirically Grounded Identifiability Theory Will Accelerate Self-Supervised Learning Research

## 原始摘要

Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) powers many current AI systems. As research
interest and investment grow, the SSL design space continues to expand. The
Platonic view of SSL, following the Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH),
suggests that despite different methods and engineering approaches, all
representations converge to the same Platonic ideal. However, this phenomenon
lacks precise theoretical explanation. By synthesizing evidence from
Identifiability Theory (IT), we show that the PRH can emerge in SSL. However,
current IT cannot explain SSL's empirical success. To bridge the gap between
theory and practice, we propose expanding IT into what we term Singular
Identifiability Theory (SITh), a broader theoretical framework encompassing the
entire SSL pipeline. SITh would allow deeper insights into the implicit data
assumptions in SSL and advance the field towards learning more interpretable
and generalizable representations. We highlight three critical directions for
future research: 1) training dynamics and convergence properties of SSL; 2) the
impact of finite samples, batch size, and data diversity; and 3) the role of
inductive biases in architecture, augmentations, initialization schemes, and
optimizers.


## AI 摘要

当前自监督学习(SSL)研究快速发展，但缺乏理论解释。研究结合可辨识性理论(IT)发现，尽管方法各异，SSL表征可能收敛于柏拉图式理想状态(PRH现象)，但现有IT无法完全解释SSL的成功。为此，作者提出"奇异可辨识性理论"(SITh)框架，旨在统一解释整个SSL流程，促进学习更具解释性和泛化能力的表征。未来研究应聚焦三个方向：1)SSL训练动态与收敛特性；2)有限样本、批量和数据多样性的影响；3)架构、数据增强、初始化和优化器中归纳偏置的作用。该理论框架有望弥合SSL理论与实践的差距。
