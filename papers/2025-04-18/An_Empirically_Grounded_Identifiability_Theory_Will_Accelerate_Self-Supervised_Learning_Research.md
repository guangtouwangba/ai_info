# An Empirically Grounded Identifiability Theory Will Accelerate Self-Supervised Learning Research

## 原始摘要

Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) powers many current AI systems. As research
interest and investment grow, the SSL design space continues to expand. The
Platonic view of SSL, following the Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH),
suggests that despite different methods and engineering approaches, all
representations converge to the same Platonic ideal. However, this phenomenon
lacks precise theoretical explanation. By synthesizing evidence from
Identifiability Theory (IT), we show that the PRH can emerge in SSL. However,
current IT cannot explain SSL's empirical success. To bridge the gap between
theory and practice, we propose expanding IT into what we term Singular
Identifiability Theory (SITh), a broader theoretical framework encompassing the
entire SSL pipeline. SITh would allow deeper insights into the implicit data
assumptions in SSL and advance the field towards learning more interpretable
and generalizable representations. We highlight three critical directions for
future research: 1) training dynamics and convergence properties of SSL; 2) the
impact of finite samples, batch size, and data diversity; and 3) the role of
inductive biases in architecture, augmentations, initialization schemes, and
optimizers.


## AI 摘要

当前自监督学习(SSL)发展迅速，但缺乏理论解释。研究表明，根据可识别性理论(IT)，SSL可能符合柏拉图表征假说(PRH)，即不同方法最终会收敛到相同理想表征。然而现有IT无法完全解释SSL的成功实践。为此，研究者提出扩展的"奇异可识别性理论"(SITh)，以建立涵盖整个SSL流程的理论框架，帮助理解其隐含的数据假设，推动学习更具解释性和泛化性的表征。未来研究应关注：1)SSL训练动态与收敛性；2)有限样本、批量大小和数据多样性的影响；3)架构、增强策略等归纳偏置的作用。
