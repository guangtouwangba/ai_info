# An Empirically Grounded Identifiability Theory Will Accelerate Self-Supervised Learning Research

## 原始摘要

Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) powers many current AI systems. As research
interest and investment grow, the SSL design space continues to expand. The
Platonic view of SSL, following the Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH),
suggests that despite different methods and engineering approaches, all
representations converge to the same Platonic ideal. However, this phenomenon
lacks precise theoretical explanation. By synthesizing evidence from
Identifiability Theory (IT), we show that the PRH can emerge in SSL. However,
current IT cannot explain SSL's empirical success. To bridge the gap between
theory and practice, we propose expanding IT into what we term Singular
Identifiability Theory (SITh), a broader theoretical framework encompassing the
entire SSL pipeline. SITh would allow deeper insights into the implicit data
assumptions in SSL and advance the field towards learning more interpretable
and generalizable representations. We highlight three critical directions for
future research: 1) training dynamics and convergence properties of SSL; 2) the
impact of finite samples, batch size, and data diversity; and 3) the role of
inductive biases in architecture, augmentations, initialization schemes, and
optimizers.


## AI 摘要

自监督学习（SSL）是当前AI系统的核心技术，但不同方法是否收敛到同一理想表征（柏拉图表征假说，PRH）缺乏理论解释。本文结合可辨识性理论（IT）证明PRH可能在SSL中出现，但现有理论无法完全解释其实际效果。为此，作者提出扩展的"奇异可辨识性理论"（SITh），构建覆盖完整SSL流程的理论框架，以揭示隐含的数据假设，推动学习更具解释性和泛化性的表征。未来研究需关注三个方向：1）SSL训练动态与收敛性；2）有限样本、批次大小和数据多样性的影响；3）架构、数据增强、初始化和优化器的归纳偏置作用。
