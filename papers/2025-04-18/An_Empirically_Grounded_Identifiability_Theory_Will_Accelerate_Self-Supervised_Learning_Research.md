# An Empirically Grounded Identifiability Theory Will Accelerate Self-Supervised Learning Research

## 原始摘要

Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) powers many current AI systems. As research
interest and investment grow, the SSL design space continues to expand. The
Platonic view of SSL, following the Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH),
suggests that despite different methods and engineering approaches, all
representations converge to the same Platonic ideal. However, this phenomenon
lacks precise theoretical explanation. By synthesizing evidence from
Identifiability Theory (IT), we show that the PRH can emerge in SSL. However,
current IT cannot explain SSL's empirical success. To bridge the gap between
theory and practice, we propose expanding IT into what we term Singular
Identifiability Theory (SITh), a broader theoretical framework encompassing the
entire SSL pipeline. SITh would allow deeper insights into the implicit data
assumptions in SSL and advance the field towards learning more interpretable
and generalizable representations. We highlight three critical directions for
future research: 1) training dynamics and convergence properties of SSL; 2) the
impact of finite samples, batch size, and data diversity; and 3) the role of
inductive biases in architecture, augmentations, initialization schemes, and
optimizers.


## AI 摘要

当前自监督学习(SSL)研究快速发展，但缺乏理论解释。研究结合可识别性理论(IT)发现，虽然柏拉图表示假说(PRH)认为不同SSL方法会收敛到相同理想表示，但现有IT无法完全解释SSL的实际成功。为此，研究者提出"奇异可识别性理论"(SITh)新框架，旨在全面解释SSL流程。SITh将帮助理解SSL隐含的数据假设，推动学习更具可解释性和泛化能力的表示。未来研究需重点关注三个方向：SSL训练动态与收敛特性、有限样本/批量/数据多样性的影响，以及架构/数据增强/初始化/优化器中归纳偏置的作用。
