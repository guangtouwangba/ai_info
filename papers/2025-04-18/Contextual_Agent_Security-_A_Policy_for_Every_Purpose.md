# Contextual Agent Security: A Policy for Every Purpose

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17070v3

## 原始摘要

Judging an action's safety requires knowledge of the context in which the
action takes place. To human agents who act in various contexts, this may seem
obvious: performing an action such as email deletion may or may not be
appropriate depending on the email's content, the goal (e.g., to erase
sensitive emails or to clean up trash), and the type of email address (e.g.,
work or personal). Unlike people, computational systems have often had only
limited agency in limited contexts. Thus, manually crafted policies and user
confirmation (e.g., smartphone app permissions or network access control
lists), while imperfect, have sufficed to restrict harmful actions. However,
with the upcoming deployment of generalist agents that support a multitude of
tasks (e.g., an automated personal assistant), we argue that we must rethink
security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these
systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain
of agents and proposes contextual agent security (Conseca), a framework to
generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了在通用智能代理（如自动化个人助手）时代重新思考安全设计的必要性。传统基于手动策略和用户确认的安全机制（如应用权限）已无法适应多任务代理的复杂情境需求。作者提出"情境代理安全"（Conseca）框架，能生成即时、情境化且可人工验证的安全策略。关键观点在于：动作安全性高度依赖情境（如删除邮件是否合理取决于邮件内容、目的和账户类型），而现有系统缺乏处理多样化情境的能力。该研究为开发适应通用代理规模与能力的新型安全机制迈出了第一步。
