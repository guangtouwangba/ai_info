# Contextual Agent Security: A Policy for Every Purpose

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17070v3

## 原始摘要

Judging an action's safety requires knowledge of the context in which the
action takes place. To human agents who act in various contexts, this may seem
obvious: performing an action such as email deletion may or may not be
appropriate depending on the email's content, the goal (e.g., to erase
sensitive emails or to clean up trash), and the type of email address (e.g.,
work or personal). Unlike people, computational systems have often had only
limited agency in limited contexts. Thus, manually crafted policies and user
confirmation (e.g., smartphone app permissions or network access control
lists), while imperfect, have sufficed to restrict harmful actions. However,
with the upcoming deployment of generalist agents that support a multitude of
tasks (e.g., an automated personal assistant), we argue that we must rethink
security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these
systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain
of agents and proposes contextual agent security (Conseca), a framework to
generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.


## AI 摘要

该论文探讨了在通用智能代理（如自动化个人助手）日益普及的背景下，传统基于手动策略和用户确认的安全设计方法的局限性。作者指出，判断一个行为的安全性需要结合具体情境（如电子邮件删除操作需考虑内容、目的和账户类型等因素）。为此，他们提出了Conseca框架，旨在为智能代理生成即时、情境化且可人工验证的安全策略。该研究标志着在适应通用代理多样化场景和能力的规模性安全设计方面迈出了重要一步，强调需要重新思考现有安全机制以应对新型智能系统的复杂性。
