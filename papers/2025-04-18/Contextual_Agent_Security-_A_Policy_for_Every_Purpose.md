# Contextual Agent Security: A Policy for Every Purpose

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17070v3

## 原始摘要

Judging an action's safety requires knowledge of the context in which the
action takes place. To human agents who act in various contexts, this may seem
obvious: performing an action such as email deletion may or may not be
appropriate depending on the email's content, the goal (e.g., to erase
sensitive emails or to clean up trash), and the type of email address (e.g.,
work or personal). Unlike people, computational systems have often had only
limited agency in limited contexts. Thus, manually crafted policies and user
confirmation (e.g., smartphone app permissions or network access control
lists), while imperfect, have sufficed to restrict harmful actions. However,
with the upcoming deployment of generalist agents that support a multitude of
tasks (e.g., an automated personal assistant), we argue that we must rethink
security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these
systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain
of agents and proposes contextual agent security (Conseca), a framework to
generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了在通用智能代理（如自动化个人助手）日益普及的背景下，如何根据具体情境判断行为安全性的问题。与人类不同，计算系统通常只能在有限情境中运作，依赖手动制定的策略和用户确认（如应用权限控制）来限制有害行为。然而，随着支持多任务的通用代理的部署，作者提出需要重新设计安全机制以适应这些系统的广泛情境和能力。为此，论文提出了"情境代理安全"框架Conseca，旨在生成即时、情境化且可人工验证的安全策略，作为适应新型代理安全挑战的初步解决方案。（100字）
