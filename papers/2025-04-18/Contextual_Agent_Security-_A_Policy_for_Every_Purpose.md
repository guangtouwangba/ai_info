# Contextual Agent Security: A Policy for Every Purpose

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17070v3

## 原始摘要

Judging an action's safety requires knowledge of the context in which the
action takes place. To human agents who act in various contexts, this may seem
obvious: performing an action such as email deletion may or may not be
appropriate depending on the email's content, the goal (e.g., to erase
sensitive emails or to clean up trash), and the type of email address (e.g.,
work or personal). Unlike people, computational systems have often had only
limited agency in limited contexts. Thus, manually crafted policies and user
confirmation (e.g., smartphone app permissions or network access control
lists), while imperfect, have sufficed to restrict harmful actions. However,
with the upcoming deployment of generalist agents that support a multitude of
tasks (e.g., an automated personal assistant), we argue that we must rethink
security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these
systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain
of agents and proposes contextual agent security (Conseca), a framework to
generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了计算系统在复杂情境下的安全性问题。传统系统依赖人工制定的策略和用户确认（如应用权限控制），但随着多功能智能代理（如自动化个人助手）的出现，其广泛的应用场景和强大能力要求重新思考安全设计。作者提出"情境代理安全"（Conseca）框架，旨在生成即时、情境相关且人类可验证的安全策略。该框架强调行动安全性取决于具体情境（如邮件删除操作需考虑内容、目的和邮箱类型），以应对通用智能代理在多任务环境中的安全挑战，为新一代计算系统安全设计迈出第一步。（99字）
