# Contextual Agent Security: A Policy for Every Purpose

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17070v3

## 原始摘要

Judging an action's safety requires knowledge of the context in which the
action takes place. To human agents who act in various contexts, this may seem
obvious: performing an action such as email deletion may or may not be
appropriate depending on the email's content, the goal (e.g., to erase
sensitive emails or to clean up trash), and the type of email address (e.g.,
work or personal). Unlike people, computational systems have often had only
limited agency in limited contexts. Thus, manually crafted policies and user
confirmation (e.g., smartphone app permissions or network access control
lists), while imperfect, have sufficed to restrict harmful actions. However,
with the upcoming deployment of generalist agents that support a multitude of
tasks (e.g., an automated personal assistant), we argue that we must rethink
security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these
systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain
of agents and proposes contextual agent security (Conseca), a framework to
generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.


## AI 摘要

该论文探讨了在通用智能代理（如自动化个人助手）时代，传统基于手工策略和用户确认的安全机制已无法适应多任务代理的复杂情境。作者提出"情境代理安全框架"（Conseca），旨在生成即时、情境相关且人类可验证的安全策略。研究指出，判断行为安全性需结合具体情境（如邮件删除操作需考虑内容、目的和邮箱类型），而现有计算系统缺乏这种灵活判断能力。Conseca作为初步方案，试图解决通用代理在多样化场景中的安全策略规模化问题，标志着安全设计思维需从静态规则转向动态情境感知的重要转变。（99字）
