# Contextual Agent Security: A Policy for Every Purpose

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17070v3

## 原始摘要

Judging an action's safety requires knowledge of the context in which the
action takes place. To human agents who act in various contexts, this may seem
obvious: performing an action such as email deletion may or may not be
appropriate depending on the email's content, the goal (e.g., to erase
sensitive emails or to clean up trash), and the type of email address (e.g.,
work or personal). Unlike people, computational systems have often had only
limited agency in limited contexts. Thus, manually crafted policies and user
confirmation (e.g., smartphone app permissions or network access control
lists), while imperfect, have sufficed to restrict harmful actions. However,
with the upcoming deployment of generalist agents that support a multitude of
tasks (e.g., an automated personal assistant), we argue that we must rethink
security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these
systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain
of agents and proposes contextual agent security (Conseca), a framework to
generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.


## AI 摘要

判断行为安全性需考虑具体情境。对人类而言，这显而易见（如删除邮件是否合适取决于内容、目的和邮箱类型）。传统计算系统因功能有限，依靠手动策略和用户确认即可防范风险。但随着多功能智能代理（如自动助手）的出现，其广泛任务能力要求重新设计安全机制以适应多样化情境。为此，本文提出"情境化代理安全框架"（Conseca），能实时生成符合情境、可供人工验证的安全策略，作为适应新一代智能系统安全需求的第一步探索。
