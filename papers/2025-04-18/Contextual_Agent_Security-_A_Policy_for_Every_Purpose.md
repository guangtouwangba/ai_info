# Contextual Agent Security: A Policy for Every Purpose

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17070v3

## 原始摘要

Judging an action's safety requires knowledge of the context in which the
action takes place. To human agents who act in various contexts, this may seem
obvious: performing an action such as email deletion may or may not be
appropriate depending on the email's content, the goal (e.g., to erase
sensitive emails or to clean up trash), and the type of email address (e.g.,
work or personal). Unlike people, computational systems have often had only
limited agency in limited contexts. Thus, manually crafted policies and user
confirmation (e.g., smartphone app permissions or network access control
lists), while imperfect, have sufficed to restrict harmful actions. However,
with the upcoming deployment of generalist agents that support a multitude of
tasks (e.g., an automated personal assistant), we argue that we must rethink
security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these
systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain
of agents and proposes contextual agent security (Conseca), a framework to
generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文探讨了在通用智能代理（如自动化个人助手）日益普及的背景下，如何重新思考安全设计。作者指出，判断一个行为的安全性需要结合具体情境，而现有基于手动策略和用户确认的安全机制（如应用权限控制）已无法适应这类系统广泛的上下文和功能。为此，论文提出了Conseca框架，旨在生成即时、情境相关且可人工验证的安全策略。该研究聚焦于智能代理领域的情境安全，为解决通用代理系统面临的安全挑战迈出了第一步，强调需要开发能适应多样化场景的动态安全机制。
