# Contextual Agent Security: A Policy for Every Purpose

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17070v3

## 原始摘要

Judging an action's safety requires knowledge of the context in which the
action takes place. To human agents who act in various contexts, this may seem
obvious: performing an action such as email deletion may or may not be
appropriate depending on the email's content, the goal (e.g., to erase
sensitive emails or to clean up trash), and the type of email address (e.g.,
work or personal). Unlike people, computational systems have often had only
limited agency in limited contexts. Thus, manually crafted policies and user
confirmation (e.g., smartphone app permissions or network access control
lists), while imperfect, have sufficed to restrict harmful actions. However,
with the upcoming deployment of generalist agents that support a multitude of
tasks (e.g., an automated personal assistant), we argue that we must rethink
security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these
systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain
of agents and proposes contextual agent security (Conseca), a framework to
generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.


## AI 摘要

该论文探讨了在通用智能代理（如自动化个人助手）时代背景下，如何重新设计安全机制以适应多任务场景。作者指出传统基于手动策略和用户确认的安全方法（如应用权限控制）在有限场景中有效，但无法应对通用代理的多样化上下文环境。为此，他们提出Conseca框架，能够生成即时、情境化且可人工验证的安全策略。研究强调判断行为安全性需结合具体情境（如邮件删除操作需考虑内容、目的和账户类型），这是当前计算系统所缺乏的能力。该工作为构建适应通用代理的上下文安全机制迈出了第一步。
