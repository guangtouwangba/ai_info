# Contextual Agent Security: A Policy for Every Purpose

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17070v3

## 原始摘要

Judging an action's safety requires knowledge of the context in which the
action takes place. To human agents who act in various contexts, this may seem
obvious: performing an action such as email deletion may or may not be
appropriate depending on the email's content, the goal (e.g., to erase
sensitive emails or to clean up trash), and the type of email address (e.g.,
work or personal). Unlike people, computational systems have often had only
limited agency in limited contexts. Thus, manually crafted policies and user
confirmation (e.g., smartphone app permissions or network access control
lists), while imperfect, have sufficed to restrict harmful actions. However,
with the upcoming deployment of generalist agents that support a multitude of
tasks (e.g., an automated personal assistant), we argue that we must rethink
security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these
systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain
of agents and proposes contextual agent security (Conseca), a framework to
generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.


## AI 摘要

该论文探讨了在通用智能代理（如自动化个人助手）日益普及的背景下，传统基于手动策略和用户确认的安全设计方法的局限性。作者指出，判断一个行为的安全性需要结合具体情境（如邮件内容、操作目的等），而现有计算系统缺乏这种情境感知能力。为此，他们提出了Conseca框架，旨在生成即时、情境化且可人工验证的安全策略，以适应通用代理在多任务环境中的复杂需求。该研究是探索情境化安全的第一步，强调了重新设计安全机制以适应智能代理广泛能力的必要性。（99字）
