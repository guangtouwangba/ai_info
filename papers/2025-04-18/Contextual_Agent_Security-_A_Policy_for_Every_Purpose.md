# Contextual Agent Security: A Policy for Every Purpose

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17070v3

## 原始摘要

Judging an action's safety requires knowledge of the context in which the
action takes place. To human agents who act in various contexts, this may seem
obvious: performing an action such as email deletion may or may not be
appropriate depending on the email's content, the goal (e.g., to erase
sensitive emails or to clean up trash), and the type of email address (e.g.,
work or personal). Unlike people, computational systems have often had only
limited agency in limited contexts. Thus, manually crafted policies and user
confirmation (e.g., smartphone app permissions or network access control
lists), while imperfect, have sufficed to restrict harmful actions. However,
with the upcoming deployment of generalist agents that support a multitude of
tasks (e.g., an automated personal assistant), we argue that we must rethink
security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these
systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain
of agents and proposes contextual agent security (Conseca), a framework to
generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.


## AI 摘要

评估一个操作的安全性需要考虑其执行的具体情境。对人类而言，这显而易见——比如删除邮件是否合适取决于邮件内容、目的（如删除敏感邮件或清理垃圾）和邮箱类型（工作或个人）。传统计算系统通常只在有限情境中运行，因此手动制定的策略（如应用权限管理）虽不完美但已足够。然而，随着多功能智能代理（如自动个人助手）的出现，其广泛的任务和情境要求重新设计安全机制。本文提出Conseca框架，旨在生成即时、情境化且可人工验证的安全策略，作为适应新一代智能代理安全需求的第一步。
