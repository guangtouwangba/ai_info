# Contextual Agent Security: A Policy for Every Purpose

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17070v3

## 原始摘要

Judging an action's safety requires knowledge of the context in which the
action takes place. To human agents who act in various contexts, this may seem
obvious: performing an action such as email deletion may or may not be
appropriate depending on the email's content, the goal (e.g., to erase
sensitive emails or to clean up trash), and the type of email address (e.g.,
work or personal). Unlike people, computational systems have often had only
limited agency in limited contexts. Thus, manually crafted policies and user
confirmation (e.g., smartphone app permissions or network access control
lists), while imperfect, have sufficed to restrict harmful actions. However,
with the upcoming deployment of generalist agents that support a multitude of
tasks (e.g., an automated personal assistant), we argue that we must rethink
security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these
systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain
of agents and proposes contextual agent security (Conseca), a framework to
generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.


## AI 摘要

该论文探讨了在通用智能代理（如自动化个人助手）日益普及的背景下，如何重新设计安全机制以适应多任务场景。作者指出，传统基于手动策略和用户确认的安全方法（如应用权限控制）已无法满足需求，因为行动安全性高度依赖上下文（如邮件删除是否合理取决于内容、目的和账户类型）。为此，论文提出Conseca框架，旨在生成即时、上下文相关且可人工验证的安全策略。这一研究标志着向适应智能代理多场景能力的安全设计迈出了重要一步，强调安全机制需随系统应用场景扩展而动态调整。
