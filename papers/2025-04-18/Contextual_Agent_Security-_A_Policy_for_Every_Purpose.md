# Contextual Agent Security: A Policy for Every Purpose

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17070v3

## 原始摘要

Judging an action's safety requires knowledge of the context in which the
action takes place. To human agents who act in various contexts, this may seem
obvious: performing an action such as email deletion may or may not be
appropriate depending on the email's content, the goal (e.g., to erase
sensitive emails or to clean up trash), and the type of email address (e.g.,
work or personal). Unlike people, computational systems have often had only
limited agency in limited contexts. Thus, manually crafted policies and user
confirmation (e.g., smartphone app permissions or network access control
lists), while imperfect, have sufficed to restrict harmful actions. However,
with the upcoming deployment of generalist agents that support a multitude of
tasks (e.g., an automated personal assistant), we argue that we must rethink
security designs to adapt to the scale of contexts and capabilities of these
systems. As a first step, this paper explores contextual security in the domain
of agents and proposes contextual agent security (Conseca), a framework to
generate just-in-time, contextual, and human-verifiable security policies.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了在通用智能代理（如自动化个人助手）日益普及的背景下，如何重新思考安全设计以适应多任务场景。作者指出，人类能根据情境（如邮件内容、目标、账户类型）判断行为（如删除邮件）的安全性，而传统计算系统依赖静态策略（如应用权限）已无法满足需求。为此，论文提出"情境化代理安全框架"（Conseca），旨在生成即时、情境化且可人工验证的动态安全策略。该框架首次尝试解决智能代理在多任务环境中的细粒度安全问题，为适应未来系统的大规模情境和能力迈出关键一步。（98字）
