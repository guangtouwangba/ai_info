## 原始摘要

Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is crucial for human-machine interaction
in diverse applications like conversational agents, industrial robotics, call
center automation, and automated subtitling. However, developing
high-performance ASR models remains challenging, particularly for low-resource
languages like Arabic, due to the scarcity of large, labeled speech datasets,
which are costly and labor-intensive to produce. In this work, we employ weakly
supervised learning to train an Arabic ASR model using the Conformer
architecture. Our model is trained from scratch on 15,000 hours of weakly
annotated speech data covering both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Dialectal
Arabic (DA), eliminating the need for costly manual transcriptions. Despite the
absence of human-verified labels, our approach attains state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance, exceeding all previous efforts in the field of Arabic ASR on the
standard benchmarks. By demonstrating the effectiveness of weak supervision as
a scalable, cost-efficient alternative to traditional supervised approaches,
paving the way for improved ASR systems in low resource settings.


## AI 摘要

该研究利用弱监督学习方法训练阿拉伯语自动语音识别(ASR)模型，采用Conformer架构，仅使用1.5万小时弱标注语音数据(包含现代标准阿拉伯语和方言阿拉伯语)，无需人工转录。尽管缺乏人工验证标签，该方法在标准测试集上取得了当前最佳性能，超越了所有先前阿拉伯语ASR研究。该工作证明了弱监督作为一种可扩展、高性价比的替代方案，能有效解决低资源语言标注数据稀缺问题，为资源匮乏场景下的ASR系统开发提供了新思路。
