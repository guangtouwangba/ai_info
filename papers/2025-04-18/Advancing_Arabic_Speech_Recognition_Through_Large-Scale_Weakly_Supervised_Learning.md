# Advancing Arabic Speech Recognition Through Large-Scale Weakly Supervised Learning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12254v1

## 原始摘要

Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is crucial for human-machine interaction
in diverse applications like conversational agents, industrial robotics, call
center automation, and automated subtitling. However, developing
high-performance ASR models remains challenging, particularly for low-resource
languages like Arabic, due to the scarcity of large, labeled speech datasets,
which are costly and labor-intensive to produce. In this work, we employ weakly
supervised learning to train an Arabic ASR model using the Conformer
architecture. Our model is trained from scratch on 15,000 hours of weakly
annotated speech data covering both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Dialectal
Arabic (DA), eliminating the need for costly manual transcriptions. Despite the
absence of human-verified labels, our approach attains state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance, exceeding all previous efforts in the field of Arabic ASR on the
standard benchmarks. By demonstrating the effectiveness of weak supervision as
a scalable, cost-efficient alternative to traditional supervised approaches,
paving the way for improved ASR systems in low resource settings.


## AI 摘要

该研究利用弱监督学习方法训练了一个基于Conformer架构的阿拉伯语自动语音识别(ASR)模型。使用15,000小时未完全标注的阿拉伯标准语和方言语音数据从头训练，避免了昂贵的人工转录成本。尽管缺乏人工验证标签，该方法在标准测试集上仍取得了当前最佳性能，超越了所有先前阿拉伯语ASR研究。这项成果证明了弱监督学习作为传统监督方法的高效替代方案，能以更低成本实现可扩展的语音识别系统，为资源匮乏语言的ASR发展提供了新思路。研究特别关注了阿拉伯语这种低资源语言面临的标注数据稀缺挑战。
