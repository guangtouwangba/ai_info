# Advancing Arabic Speech Recognition Through Large-Scale Weakly Supervised Learning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12254v1

## 原始摘要

Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is crucial for human-machine interaction
in diverse applications like conversational agents, industrial robotics, call
center automation, and automated subtitling. However, developing
high-performance ASR models remains challenging, particularly for low-resource
languages like Arabic, due to the scarcity of large, labeled speech datasets,
which are costly and labor-intensive to produce. In this work, we employ weakly
supervised learning to train an Arabic ASR model using the Conformer
architecture. Our model is trained from scratch on 15,000 hours of weakly
annotated speech data covering both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Dialectal
Arabic (DA), eliminating the need for costly manual transcriptions. Despite the
absence of human-verified labels, our approach attains state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance, exceeding all previous efforts in the field of Arabic ASR on the
standard benchmarks. By demonstrating the effectiveness of weak supervision as
a scalable, cost-efficient alternative to traditional supervised approaches,
paving the way for improved ASR systems in low resource settings.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种基于弱监督学习的阿拉伯语自动语音识别(ASR)模型，采用Conformer架构，使用15,000小时的弱标注语音数据(包含现代标准阿拉伯语和方言阿拉伯语)从头训练。该方法无需昂贵的人工转录，在标准基准测试中取得了最先进的性能表现，超越了之前所有阿拉伯语ASR研究成果。该工作证明了弱监督学习作为传统监督方法的高效低成本替代方案的有效性，为低资源语言环境下的ASR系统开发提供了新思路，对会话代理、工业机器人、呼叫中心自动化等应用具有重要意义。
