# Voice Interaction With Conversational AI Could Facilitate Thoughtful Reflection and Substantive Revision in Writing

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08687v1

## 原始摘要

Writing well requires not only expressing ideas but also refining them
through revision, a process facilitated by reflection. Prior research suggests
that feedback delivered through dialogues, such as those in writing center
tutoring sessions, can help writers reflect more thoughtfully on their work
compared to static feedback. Recent advancements in multi-modal large language
models (LLMs) now offer new possibilities for supporting interactive and
expressive voice-based reflection in writing. In particular, we propose that
LLM-generated static feedback can be repurposed as conversation starters,
allowing writers to seek clarification, request examples, and ask follow-up
questions, thereby fostering deeper reflection on their writing. We argue that
voice-based interaction can naturally facilitate this conversational exchange,
encouraging writers' engagement with higher-order concerns, facilitating
iterative refinement of their reflections, and reduce cognitive load compared
to text-based interactions. To investigate these effects, we propose a
formative study exploring how text vs. voice input influence writers'
reflection and subsequent revisions. Findings from this study will inform the
design of intelligent and interactive writing tools, offering insights into how
voice-based interactions with LLM-powered conversational agents can support
reflection and revision.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨如何通过对话式反馈促进写作反思，指出写作中心辅导等对话形式比静态反馈更能激发深度思考。随着多模态大语言模型(LLM)的发展，研究者提出将LLM生成的静态反馈转化为对话起点，让作者能追问细节、请求示例，从而深化反思。相比文字交互，语音交互能更自然地促进对话，降低认知负荷，帮助作者关注更高层次的写作问题。研究计划开展形成性实验，比较文字与语音输入对写作反思及修改的影响，为设计智能写作工具提供依据，探索语音交互如何支持写作反思与修改过程。(100字)
