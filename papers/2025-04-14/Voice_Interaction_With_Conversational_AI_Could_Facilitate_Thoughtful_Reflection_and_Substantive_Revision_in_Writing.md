# Voice Interaction With Conversational AI Could Facilitate Thoughtful Reflection and Substantive Revision in Writing

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08687v1

## 原始摘要

Writing well requires not only expressing ideas but also refining them
through revision, a process facilitated by reflection. Prior research suggests
that feedback delivered through dialogues, such as those in writing center
tutoring sessions, can help writers reflect more thoughtfully on their work
compared to static feedback. Recent advancements in multi-modal large language
models (LLMs) now offer new possibilities for supporting interactive and
expressive voice-based reflection in writing. In particular, we propose that
LLM-generated static feedback can be repurposed as conversation starters,
allowing writers to seek clarification, request examples, and ask follow-up
questions, thereby fostering deeper reflection on their writing. We argue that
voice-based interaction can naturally facilitate this conversational exchange,
encouraging writers' engagement with higher-order concerns, facilitating
iterative refinement of their reflections, and reduce cognitive load compared
to text-based interactions. To investigate these effects, we propose a
formative study exploring how text vs. voice input influence writers'
reflection and subsequent revisions. Findings from this study will inform the
design of intelligent and interactive writing tools, offering insights into how
voice-based interactions with LLM-powered conversational agents can support
reflection and revision.


## AI 摘要

研究表明，对话式反馈（如写作辅导）比静态反馈更能促进作者反思。多模态大语言模型（LLM）为基于语音的交互式写作反思提供了新可能：将LLM生成的静态反馈转化为对话起点，让作者通过提问深化思考。语音交互相比文本更能自然促进对话，帮助作者关注核心问题、迭代优化思考，并降低认知负荷。研究者计划开展对比实验，探究文本与语音输入如何影响写作反思及修改，为开发智能写作工具提供依据，探索语音交互的LLM对话代理如何支持写作反思与修改。（99字）
