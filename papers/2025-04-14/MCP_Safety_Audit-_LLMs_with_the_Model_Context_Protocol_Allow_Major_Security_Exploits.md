# MCP Safety Audit: LLMs with the Model Context Protocol Allow Major Security Exploits

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03767v2

## 原始摘要

To reduce development overhead and enable seamless integration between
potential components comprising any given generative AI application, the Model
Context Protocol (MCP) (Anthropic, 2024) has recently been released and
subsequently widely adopted. The MCP is an open protocol that standardizes API
calls to large language models (LLMs), data sources, and agentic tools. By
connecting multiple MCP servers, each defined with a set of tools, resources,
and prompts, users are able to define automated workflows fully driven by LLMs.
However, we show that the current MCP design carries a wide range of security
risks for end users. In particular, we demonstrate that industry-leading LLMs
may be coerced into using MCP tools to compromise an AI developer's system
through various attacks, such as malicious code execution, remote access
control, and credential theft. To proactively mitigate these and related
attacks, we introduce a safety auditing tool, MCPSafetyScanner, the first
agentic tool to assess the security of an arbitrary MCP server. MCPScanner uses
several agents to (a) automatically determine adversarial samples given an MCP
server's tools and resources; (b) search for related vulnerabilities and
remediations based on those samples; and (c) generate a security report
detailing all findings. Our work highlights serious security issues with
general-purpose agentic workflows while also providing a proactive tool to
audit MCP server safety and address detected vulnerabilities before deployment.

## AI 摘要

最近发布的模型上下文协议（MCP）通过标准化API调用简化了生成式AI应用的开发，但研究发现其设计存在严重安全风险，可能导致恶意代码执行、远程控制等攻击。为此，研究者开发了首个MCP安全审计工具MCPSafetyScanner，它能自动分析MCP服务器的工具和资源，生成对抗样本，查找相关漏洞并提供修复建议，最终生成详细安全报告。该工具可帮助开发者在部署前主动检测和修复漏洞，目前已开源。研究既揭示了通用智能工作流的安全隐患，也提供了实用的安全解决方案。
