# Youth as Advisors in Participatory Design: Situating Teens' Expertise in Everyday Algorithm Auditing with Teachers and Researchers

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07202v2

## 原始摘要

Research on children and youth's participation in different roles in the
design of technologies is one of the core contributions in child-computer
interaction studies. Building on this work, we situate youth as advisors to a
group of high school computer science teacher- and researcher-designers
creating learning activities in the context of emerging technologies.
Specifically, we explore algorithm auditing as a potential entry point for
youth and adults to critically evaluate generative AI algorithmic systems, with
the goal of designing classroom lessons. Through a two-hour session where three
teenagers (16-18 years) served as advisors, we (1) examine the types of
expertise the teens shared and (2) identify back stage design elements that
fostered their agency and voice in this advisory role. Our discussion considers
opportunities and challenges in situating youth as advisors, providing
recommendations for actions that researchers, facilitators, and teachers can
take to make this unusual arrangement feasible and productive.


## AI 摘要

这篇研究探讨了青少年作为顾问参与技术设计的过程，重点分析了他们在算法审计中的作用。研究团队邀请了三名16-18岁的青少年担任顾问，与高中计算机科学教师和研究人员共同设计关于生成式AI系统的课堂活动。研究发现，青少年在咨询过程中展现了独特的专业知识，并通过特定的后台设计元素增强了他们的主动性和发言权。研究还讨论了将青少年作为顾问的机遇与挑战，并为研究人员、教师等提供了可行性建议，以促进这种非传统合作模式的有效实施。
