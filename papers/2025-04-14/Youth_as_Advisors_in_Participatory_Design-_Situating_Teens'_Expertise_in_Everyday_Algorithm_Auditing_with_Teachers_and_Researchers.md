# Youth as Advisors in Participatory Design: Situating Teens' Expertise in Everyday Algorithm Auditing with Teachers and Researchers

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07202v2

## 原始摘要

Research on children and youth's participation in different roles in the
design of technologies is one of the core contributions in child-computer
interaction studies. Building on this work, we situate youth as advisors to a
group of high school computer science teacher- and researcher-designers
creating learning activities in the context of emerging technologies.
Specifically, we explore algorithm auditing as a potential entry point for
youth and adults to critically evaluate generative AI algorithmic systems, with
the goal of designing classroom lessons. Through a two-hour session where three
teenagers (16-18 years) served as advisors, we (1) examine the types of
expertise the teens shared and (2) identify back stage design elements that
fostered their agency and voice in this advisory role. Our discussion considers
opportunities and challenges in situating youth as advisors, providing
recommendations for actions that researchers, facilitators, and teachers can
take to make this unusual arrangement feasible and productive.


## AI 摘要

这项研究探讨了青少年作为顾问参与高中计算机科学教师和研究者的设计过程，共同开发新兴技术相关的学习活动。研究聚焦算法审计作为切入点，帮助青少年和成人批判性评估生成式AI算法系统，以设计课堂课程。通过两小时的咨询会议，三名16-18岁青少年分享了技术和社会层面的专业知识。研究发现，"幕后设计"元素能有效提升青少年在顾问角色中的主动性和话语权。研究讨论了青少年担任顾问的机遇与挑战，并为研究者、教师等提供了可行性建议，以促进这种创新合作模式的有效实施。
