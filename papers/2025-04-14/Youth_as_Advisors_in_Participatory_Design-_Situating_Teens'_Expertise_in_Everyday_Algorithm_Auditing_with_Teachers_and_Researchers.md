# Youth as Advisors in Participatory Design: Situating Teens' Expertise in Everyday Algorithm Auditing with Teachers and Researchers

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07202v2

## 原始摘要

Research on children and youth's participation in different roles in the
design of technologies is one of the core contributions in child-computer
interaction studies. Building on this work, we situate youth as advisors to a
group of high school computer science teacher- and researcher-designers
creating learning activities in the context of emerging technologies.
Specifically, we explore algorithm auditing as a potential entry point for
youth and adults to critically evaluate generative AI algorithmic systems, with
the goal of designing classroom lessons. Through a two-hour session where three
teenagers (16-18 years) served as advisors, we (1) examine the types of
expertise the teens shared and (2) identify back stage design elements that
fostered their agency and voice in this advisory role. Our discussion considers
opportunities and challenges in situating youth as advisors, providing
recommendations for actions that researchers, facilitators, and teachers can
take to make this unusual arrangement feasible and productive.


## AI 摘要

这项研究探讨了青少年作为顾问参与高中计算机科学课程设计的过程，聚焦于算法审计作为批判性评估生成式AI系统的切入点。在2小时的研讨中，3名16-18岁青少年提供了专业知识，研究分析了他们分享的见解类型以及促进其参与的设计要素。研究揭示了青少年担任顾问角色的机遇与挑战，并为研究者、教师等提供了可行性建议，以增强青少年在设计过程中的话语权和能动性。该研究为儿童计算机交互领域提供了新的实践视角，展示了青少年在技术设计中的潜在贡献。
