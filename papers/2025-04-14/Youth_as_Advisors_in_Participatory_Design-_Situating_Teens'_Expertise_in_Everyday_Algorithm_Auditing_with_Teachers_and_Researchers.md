# Youth as Advisors in Participatory Design: Situating Teens' Expertise in Everyday Algorithm Auditing with Teachers and Researchers

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07202v2

## 原始摘要

Research on children and youth's participation in different roles in the
design of technologies is one of the core contributions in child-computer
interaction studies. Building on this work, we situate youth as advisors to a
group of high school computer science teacher- and researcher-designers
creating learning activities in the context of emerging technologies.
Specifically, we explore algorithm auditing as a potential entry point for
youth and adults to critically evaluate generative AI algorithmic systems, with
the goal of designing classroom lessons. Through a two-hour session where three
teenagers (16-18 years) served as advisors, we (1) examine the types of
expertise the teens shared and (2) identify back stage design elements that
fostered their agency and voice in this advisory role. Our discussion considers
opportunities and challenges in situating youth as advisors, providing
recommendations for actions that researchers, facilitators, and teachers can
take to make this unusual arrangement feasible and productive.


## AI 摘要

这项研究探讨了青少年作为顾问参与高中计算机科学课程设计中算法审计的作用。三名16-18岁的青少年在2小时的会议中为教师和研究人员提供建议，帮助设计关于生成式AI算法的批判性评估课程。研究发现：(1)青少年分享了技术使用、伦理考量和学习体验等多方面专长；(2)特定的后台设计元素能有效提升他们在顾问角色中的主动性和发言权。研究为将青少年定位为设计顾问提供了实践建议，指出了这种非传统安排的机会与挑战，为研究者、教师和协调者提供了可行性指导。
