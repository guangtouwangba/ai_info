# Youth as Advisors in Participatory Design: Situating Teens' Expertise in Everyday Algorithm Auditing with Teachers and Researchers

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07202v2

## 原始摘要

Research on children and youth's participation in different roles in the
design of technologies is one of the core contributions in child-computer
interaction studies. Building on this work, we situate youth as advisors to a
group of high school computer science teacher- and researcher-designers
creating learning activities in the context of emerging technologies.
Specifically, we explore algorithm auditing as a potential entry point for
youth and adults to critically evaluate generative AI algorithmic systems, with
the goal of designing classroom lessons. Through a two-hour session where three
teenagers (16-18 years) served as advisors, we (1) examine the types of
expertise the teens shared and (2) identify back stage design elements that
fostered their agency and voice in this advisory role. Our discussion considers
opportunities and challenges in situating youth as advisors, providing
recommendations for actions that researchers, facilitators, and teachers can
take to make this unusual arrangement feasible and productive.


## AI 摘要

本研究探讨了青少年作为顾问参与技术设计的过程，聚焦于高中生与计算机科学教师及研究人员合作，通过算法审计批判性评估生成式AI系统，以设计课堂活动。研究发现，16-18岁的青少年顾问在2小时的会议中贡献了独特见解，并分析了促进其主动性和发言权的幕后设计要素。研究为将青少年纳入设计顾问角色提供了实践建议，同时指出了这一创新合作模式的机遇与挑战，为研究者、教师和协调者提供了可行性指导。该研究拓展了儿童-计算机交互领域关于青少年参与技术设计的角色多样性探索。
