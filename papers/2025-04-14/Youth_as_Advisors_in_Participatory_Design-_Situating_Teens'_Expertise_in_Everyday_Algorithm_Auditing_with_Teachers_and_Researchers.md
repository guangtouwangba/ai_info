# Youth as Advisors in Participatory Design: Situating Teens' Expertise in Everyday Algorithm Auditing with Teachers and Researchers

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07202v2

## 原始摘要

Research on children and youth's participation in different roles in the
design of technologies is one of the core contributions in child-computer
interaction studies. Building on this work, we situate youth as advisors to a
group of high school computer science teacher- and researcher-designers
creating learning activities in the context of emerging technologies.
Specifically, we explore algorithm auditing as a potential entry point for
youth and adults to critically evaluate generative AI algorithmic systems, with
the goal of designing classroom lessons. Through a two-hour session where three
teenagers (16-18 years) served as advisors, we (1) examine the types of
expertise the teens shared and (2) identify back stage design elements that
fostered their agency and voice in this advisory role. Our discussion considers
opportunities and challenges in situating youth as advisors, providing
recommendations for actions that researchers, facilitators, and teachers can
take to make this unusual arrangement feasible and productive.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了青少年作为顾问参与高中计算机科学教师和研究者的技术设计过程，重点评估生成式AI算法的审计作为课堂活动设计的切入点。通过两小时的工作坊，三名16-18岁青少年提供建议，研究发现：(1)青少年展示了批判性思维和技术洞察力等专业知识；(2)幕后设计元素能有效提升他们在顾问角色中的自主权和话语权。研究为将青少年定位为设计顾问提供了实践建议，同时指出了这种非传统合作模式的机遇与挑战，对研究者、教师和协调者如何促进此类合作具有指导意义。（99字）
