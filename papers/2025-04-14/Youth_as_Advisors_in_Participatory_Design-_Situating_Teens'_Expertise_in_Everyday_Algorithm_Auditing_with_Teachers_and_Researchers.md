# Youth as Advisors in Participatory Design: Situating Teens' Expertise in Everyday Algorithm Auditing with Teachers and Researchers

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07202v2

## 原始摘要

Research on children and youth's participation in different roles in the
design of technologies is one of the core contributions in child-computer
interaction studies. Building on this work, we situate youth as advisors to a
group of high school computer science teacher- and researcher-designers
creating learning activities in the context of emerging technologies.
Specifically, we explore algorithm auditing as a potential entry point for
youth and adults to critically evaluate generative AI algorithmic systems, with
the goal of designing classroom lessons. Through a two-hour session where three
teenagers (16-18 years) served as advisors, we (1) examine the types of
expertise the teens shared and (2) identify back stage design elements that
fostered their agency and voice in this advisory role. Our discussion considers
opportunities and challenges in situating youth as advisors, providing
recommendations for actions that researchers, facilitators, and teachers can
take to make this unusual arrangement feasible and productive.


## AI 摘要

本研究探讨了青少年作为顾问参与技术设计的过程，重点关注高中生与计算机科学教师及研究人员合作设计新兴技术学习活动。通过两小时的研讨，三名16-18岁青少年担任顾问，研究分析了他们分享的专业见解，并识别了促进其主动性和发言权的幕后设计要素。研究讨论了青少年担任顾问的机遇与挑战，为研究者、引导者和教师提供了可行性建议，以优化这种非常规合作模式。核心关注点是通过算法审计作为切入点，帮助青少年和成人批判性评估生成式AI系统，从而设计课堂教学内容。
