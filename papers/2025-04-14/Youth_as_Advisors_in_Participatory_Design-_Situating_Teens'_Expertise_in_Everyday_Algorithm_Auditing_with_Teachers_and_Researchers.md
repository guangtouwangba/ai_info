# Youth as Advisors in Participatory Design: Situating Teens' Expertise in Everyday Algorithm Auditing with Teachers and Researchers

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07202v2

## 原始摘要

Research on children and youth's participation in different roles in the
design of technologies is one of the core contributions in child-computer
interaction studies. Building on this work, we situate youth as advisors to a
group of high school computer science teacher- and researcher-designers
creating learning activities in the context of emerging technologies.
Specifically, we explore algorithm auditing as a potential entry point for
youth and adults to critically evaluate generative AI algorithmic systems, with
the goal of designing classroom lessons. Through a two-hour session where three
teenagers (16-18 years) served as advisors, we (1) examine the types of
expertise the teens shared and (2) identify back stage design elements that
fostered their agency and voice in this advisory role. Our discussion considers
opportunities and challenges in situating youth as advisors, providing
recommendations for actions that researchers, facilitators, and teachers can
take to make this unusual arrangement feasible and productive.


## AI 摘要

这篇研究探讨了青少年作为顾问参与高中计算机科学课程设计的过程，聚焦于通过算法审计来批判性评估生成式AI系统。在2小时的研讨中，3名16-18岁的青少年分享了技术使用经验和社会影响见解，帮助教师和研究者设计相关课程。研究发现，非正式讨论和可视化工具能有效促进青少年表达意见。研究为将青少年纳入技术设计顾问角色提供了实践建议，包括营造平等氛围和采用适宜方法激发参与，同时也指出了这种非传统安排面临的挑战。这为儿童计算机交互领域提供了新的参与模式参考。
