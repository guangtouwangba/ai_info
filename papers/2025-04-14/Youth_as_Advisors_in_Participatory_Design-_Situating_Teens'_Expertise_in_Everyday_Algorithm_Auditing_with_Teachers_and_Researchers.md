# Youth as Advisors in Participatory Design: Situating Teens' Expertise in Everyday Algorithm Auditing with Teachers and Researchers

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07202v2

## 原始摘要

Research on children and youth's participation in different roles in the
design of technologies is one of the core contributions in child-computer
interaction studies. Building on this work, we situate youth as advisors to a
group of high school computer science teacher- and researcher-designers
creating learning activities in the context of emerging technologies.
Specifically, we explore algorithm auditing as a potential entry point for
youth and adults to critically evaluate generative AI algorithmic systems, with
the goal of designing classroom lessons. Through a two-hour session where three
teenagers (16-18 years) served as advisors, we (1) examine the types of
expertise the teens shared and (2) identify back stage design elements that
fostered their agency and voice in this advisory role. Our discussion considers
opportunities and challenges in situating youth as advisors, providing
recommendations for actions that researchers, facilitators, and teachers can
take to make this unusual arrangement feasible and productive.


## AI 摘要

这篇研究探讨了青少年作为顾问参与技术设计的过程，聚焦于高中生与计算机科学教师及研究人员合作设计生成式AI算法审计课程的活动。通过两小时的研讨，三名16-18岁青少年分享了技术使用、伦理和社会影响等专业知识。研究发现，营造开放平等的"后台"环境能有效提升青少年的参与度和话语权。研究为将青少年纳入设计顾问角色提供了实践建议，同时也指出了这种非传统合作模式面临的挑战，为研究者、教师和协调者如何促进此类合作提供了参考。
