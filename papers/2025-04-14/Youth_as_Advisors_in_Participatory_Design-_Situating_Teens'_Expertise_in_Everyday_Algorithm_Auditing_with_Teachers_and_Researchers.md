# Youth as Advisors in Participatory Design: Situating Teens' Expertise in Everyday Algorithm Auditing with Teachers and Researchers

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07202v2

## 原始摘要

Research on children and youth's participation in different roles in the
design of technologies is one of the core contributions in child-computer
interaction studies. Building on this work, we situate youth as advisors to a
group of high school computer science teacher- and researcher-designers
creating learning activities in the context of emerging technologies.
Specifically, we explore algorithm auditing as a potential entry point for
youth and adults to critically evaluate generative AI algorithmic systems, with
the goal of designing classroom lessons. Through a two-hour session where three
teenagers (16-18 years) served as advisors, we (1) examine the types of
expertise the teens shared and (2) identify back stage design elements that
fostered their agency and voice in this advisory role. Our discussion considers
opportunities and challenges in situating youth as advisors, providing
recommendations for actions that researchers, facilitators, and teachers can
take to make this unusual arrangement feasible and productive.


## AI 摘要

本研究探讨了青少年作为顾问参与高中计算机科学课程设计的可行性。三名16-18岁青少年在2小时的会议中担任顾问，与教师和研究人员共同设计关于生成式AI算法审计的课堂活动。研究重点分析了：(1)青少年分享的专业见解类型；(2)促进其参与度和发言权的幕后设计要素。研究为将青少年定位为设计顾问提供了实践建议，指出了这种非传统合作模式的机遇与挑战，为研究者、引导者和教师提供了可行性操作指南。该研究拓展了儿童-计算机交互领域中青少年参与技术设计的角色研究。
