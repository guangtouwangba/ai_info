# Youth as Advisors in Participatory Design: Situating Teens' Expertise in Everyday Algorithm Auditing with Teachers and Researchers

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07202v2

## 原始摘要

Research on children and youth's participation in different roles in the
design of technologies is one of the core contributions in child-computer
interaction studies. Building on this work, we situate youth as advisors to a
group of high school computer science teacher- and researcher-designers
creating learning activities in the context of emerging technologies.
Specifically, we explore algorithm auditing as a potential entry point for
youth and adults to critically evaluate generative AI algorithmic systems, with
the goal of designing classroom lessons. Through a two-hour session where three
teenagers (16-18 years) served as advisors, we (1) examine the types of
expertise the teens shared and (2) identify back stage design elements that
fostered their agency and voice in this advisory role. Our discussion considers
opportunities and challenges in situating youth as advisors, providing
recommendations for actions that researchers, facilitators, and teachers can
take to make this unusual arrangement feasible and productive.


## AI 摘要

这项研究探讨了青少年作为顾问参与高中计算机科学教师和研究人员设计新兴技术学习活动的角色。通过一个两小时的会议，三名16-18岁的青少年担任顾问，研究者分析了他们分享的专业知识类型，并识别了促进其参与和表达的设计要素。研究重点关注算法审计作为青少年和成人批判性评估生成式AI系统的切入点，以设计课堂课程。研究讨论了青少年担任顾问的机会与挑战，并为研究人员、教师等提供了使这种非常规安排可行且高效的建议。
