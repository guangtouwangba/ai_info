# Youth as Advisors in Participatory Design: Situating Teens' Expertise in Everyday Algorithm Auditing with Teachers and Researchers

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07202v2

## 原始摘要

Research on children and youth's participation in different roles in the
design of technologies is one of the core contributions in child-computer
interaction studies. Building on this work, we situate youth as advisors to a
group of high school computer science teacher- and researcher-designers
creating learning activities in the context of emerging technologies.
Specifically, we explore algorithm auditing as a potential entry point for
youth and adults to critically evaluate generative AI algorithmic systems, with
the goal of designing classroom lessons. Through a two-hour session where three
teenagers (16-18 years) served as advisors, we (1) examine the types of
expertise the teens shared and (2) identify back stage design elements that
fostered their agency and voice in this advisory role. Our discussion considers
opportunities and challenges in situating youth as advisors, providing
recommendations for actions that researchers, facilitators, and teachers can
take to make this unusual arrangement feasible and productive.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了青少年作为顾问参与高中计算机科学课程设计的过程，重点评估生成式AI算法系统。三名16-18岁青少年在两小时的咨询会议中分享了技术和社会层面的专业知识。研究发现，通过创造"后台"设计空间，能有效提升青少年的参与感和话语权。研究为将青少年纳入技术设计顾问角色提供了实践建议，同时也指出了这种非传统安排面临的挑战，为研究者、教师和协调者提供了可行性方案。该工作拓展了儿童计算机交互领域关于青少年参与技术设计的角色研究。
