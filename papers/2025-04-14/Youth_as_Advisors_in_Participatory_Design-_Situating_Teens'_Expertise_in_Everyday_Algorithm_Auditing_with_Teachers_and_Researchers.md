# Youth as Advisors in Participatory Design: Situating Teens' Expertise in Everyday Algorithm Auditing with Teachers and Researchers

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07202v2

## 原始摘要

Research on children and youth's participation in different roles in the
design of technologies is one of the core contributions in child-computer
interaction studies. Building on this work, we situate youth as advisors to a
group of high school computer science teacher- and researcher-designers
creating learning activities in the context of emerging technologies.
Specifically, we explore algorithm auditing as a potential entry point for
youth and adults to critically evaluate generative AI algorithmic systems, with
the goal of designing classroom lessons. Through a two-hour session where three
teenagers (16-18 years) served as advisors, we (1) examine the types of
expertise the teens shared and (2) identify back stage design elements that
fostered their agency and voice in this advisory role. Our discussion considers
opportunities and challenges in situating youth as advisors, providing
recommendations for actions that researchers, facilitators, and teachers can
take to make this unusual arrangement feasible and productive.


## AI 摘要

这项研究探讨了青少年作为顾问参与高中计算机科学教师和研究人员设计新兴技术学习活动的可行性。研究通过两小时的会议，让三名16-18岁青少年担任顾问，重点分析了：(1)青少年分享的专业知识类型；(2)促进其参与和表达的后台设计要素。研究发现算法审计可作为青少年和成人批判性评估生成式AI系统的切入点，用于设计课堂教学。研究讨论了青少年担任顾问的机遇与挑战，并为研究者、教师等提供了使这种非常规安排可行且高效的建议。
