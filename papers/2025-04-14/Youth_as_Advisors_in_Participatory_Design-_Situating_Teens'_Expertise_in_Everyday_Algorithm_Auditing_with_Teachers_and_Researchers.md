# Youth as Advisors in Participatory Design: Situating Teens' Expertise in Everyday Algorithm Auditing with Teachers and Researchers

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07202v2

## 原始摘要

Research on children and youth's participation in different roles in the
design of technologies is one of the core contributions in child-computer
interaction studies. Building on this work, we situate youth as advisors to a
group of high school computer science teacher- and researcher-designers
creating learning activities in the context of emerging technologies.
Specifically, we explore algorithm auditing as a potential entry point for
youth and adults to critically evaluate generative AI algorithmic systems, with
the goal of designing classroom lessons. Through a two-hour session where three
teenagers (16-18 years) served as advisors, we (1) examine the types of
expertise the teens shared and (2) identify back stage design elements that
fostered their agency and voice in this advisory role. Our discussion considers
opportunities and challenges in situating youth as advisors, providing
recommendations for actions that researchers, facilitators, and teachers can
take to make this unusual arrangement feasible and productive.


## AI 摘要

这项研究探讨了青少年作为顾问参与技术设计的角色。研究者让3名16-18岁青少年担任高中计算机科学教师和研究者的顾问，共同设计关于生成式AI算法审计的教学活动。通过2小时的研讨，研究发现：(1)青少年提供了独特见解；(2)特定设计元素能有效提升他们在顾问角色中的主动性和发言权。研究分析了让青少年担任顾问的机遇与挑战，并为研究者、教师等提供了可行性建议，以促进这种非传统合作模式的有效实施。该研究拓展了人机交互领域中儿童青少年参与技术设计的实践方式。
