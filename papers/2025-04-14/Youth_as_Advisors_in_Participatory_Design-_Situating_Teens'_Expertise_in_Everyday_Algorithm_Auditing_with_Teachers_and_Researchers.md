# Youth as Advisors in Participatory Design: Situating Teens' Expertise in Everyday Algorithm Auditing with Teachers and Researchers

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07202v2

## 原始摘要

Research on children and youth's participation in different roles in the
design of technologies is one of the core contributions in child-computer
interaction studies. Building on this work, we situate youth as advisors to a
group of high school computer science teacher- and researcher-designers
creating learning activities in the context of emerging technologies.
Specifically, we explore algorithm auditing as a potential entry point for
youth and adults to critically evaluate generative AI algorithmic systems, with
the goal of designing classroom lessons. Through a two-hour session where three
teenagers (16-18 years) served as advisors, we (1) examine the types of
expertise the teens shared and (2) identify back stage design elements that
fostered their agency and voice in this advisory role. Our discussion considers
opportunities and challenges in situating youth as advisors, providing
recommendations for actions that researchers, facilitators, and teachers can
take to make this unusual arrangement feasible and productive.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了青少年作为顾问参与高中计算机科学教师和研究者的技术设计过程，重点关注生成式AI算法的审计。通过两小时的讨论会，三名16-18岁青少年分享了技术使用经验和批判性见解。研究发现，青少年在算法审计中展现出独特的专业知识，而"幕后设计"元素（如平等对话环境）有效提升了他们的参与度和话语权。研究为将青少年纳入技术设计顾问角色提供了实践建议，同时也指出了这种非传统安排面临的挑战，为教育工作者和研究者优化青少年参与机制提供了参考。
