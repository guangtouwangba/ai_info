# A Survey of Large Language Model Empowered Agents for Recommendation and Search: Towards Next-Generation Information Retrieval

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05659v2

## 原始摘要

Information technology has profoundly altered the way humans interact with
information. The vast amount of content created, shared, and disseminated
online has made it increasingly difficult to access relevant information. Over
the past two decades, recommender systems and search (collectively referred to
as information retrieval systems) have evolved significantly to address these
challenges. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
capabilities that surpass human performance in various language-related tasks
and exhibit general understanding, reasoning, and decision-making abilities.
This paper explores the transformative potential of LLM agents in enhancing
recommender and search systems. We discuss the motivations and roles of LLM
agents, and establish a classification framework to elaborate on the existing
research. We highlight the immense potential of LLM agents in addressing
current challenges in recommendation and search, providing insights into future
research directions. This paper is the first to systematically review and
classify the research on LLM agents in these domains, offering a novel
perspective on leveraging this advanced AI technology for information
retrieval. To help understand the existing works, we list the existing papers
on LLM agent based recommendation and search at this link:

## AI 摘要

信息技术的快速发展改变了人类获取信息的方式，海量在线内容使得获取相关信息变得困难。近20年来，推荐系统和搜索引擎（统称信息检索系统）不断演进以应对这些挑战。大语言模型(LLMs)的最新进展展现出超越人类的多项语言处理能力，以及理解、推理和决策能力。本文探讨了LLM代理在增强推荐和搜索系统中的变革潜力，提出了分类框架，系统梳理了相关研究，并指出了未来方向。这是首篇对LLM代理在这两个领域的研究进行系统综述和分类的论文，为利用这一先进AI技术改进信息检索提供了新视角。
