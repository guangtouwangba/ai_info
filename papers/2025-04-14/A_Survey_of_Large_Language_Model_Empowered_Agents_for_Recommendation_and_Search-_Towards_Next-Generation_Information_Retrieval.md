# A Survey of Large Language Model Empowered Agents for Recommendation and Search: Towards Next-Generation Information Retrieval

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05659v2

## 原始摘要

Information technology has profoundly altered the way humans interact with
information. The vast amount of content created, shared, and disseminated
online has made it increasingly difficult to access relevant information. Over
the past two decades, recommender systems and search (collectively referred to
as information retrieval systems) have evolved significantly to address these
challenges. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
capabilities that surpass human performance in various language-related tasks
and exhibit general understanding, reasoning, and decision-making abilities.
This paper explores the transformative potential of LLM agents in enhancing
recommender and search systems. We discuss the motivations and roles of LLM
agents, and establish a classification framework to elaborate on the existing
research. We highlight the immense potential of LLM agents in addressing
current challenges in recommendation and search, providing insights into future
research directions. This paper is the first to systematically review and
classify the research on LLM agents in these domains, offering a novel
perspective on leveraging this advanced AI technology for information
retrieval. To help understand the existing works, we list the existing papers
on LLM agent based recommendation and search at this link:
