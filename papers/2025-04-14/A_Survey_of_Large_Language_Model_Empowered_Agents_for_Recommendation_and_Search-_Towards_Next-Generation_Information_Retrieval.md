# A Survey of Large Language Model Empowered Agents for Recommendation and Search: Towards Next-Generation Information Retrieval

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05659v2

## 原始摘要

Information technology has profoundly altered the way humans interact with
information. The vast amount of content created, shared, and disseminated
online has made it increasingly difficult to access relevant information. Over
the past two decades, recommender systems and search (collectively referred to
as information retrieval systems) have evolved significantly to address these
challenges. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
capabilities that surpass human performance in various language-related tasks
and exhibit general understanding, reasoning, and decision-making abilities.
This paper explores the transformative potential of LLM agents in enhancing
recommender and search systems. We discuss the motivations and roles of LLM
agents, and establish a classification framework to elaborate on the existing
research. We highlight the immense potential of LLM agents in addressing
current challenges in recommendation and search, providing insights into future
research directions. This paper is the first to systematically review and
classify the research on LLM agents in these domains, offering a novel
perspective on leveraging this advanced AI technology for information
retrieval. To help understand the existing works, we list the existing papers
on LLM agent based recommendation and search at this link:

## AI 摘要

信息技术深刻改变了人类获取信息的方式，但海量在线内容也增加了获取相关信息的难度。近20年来，推荐系统和搜索引擎（统称信息检索系统）不断发展以应对这一挑战。最新的大型语言模型（LLMs）在语言任务上已超越人类表现，并展现出理解、推理和决策能力。本文探讨了LLM代理在增强推荐和搜索系统中的变革潜力，建立了分类框架梳理现有研究，并指出其解决当前挑战的巨大潜力。这是首个系统综述LLM代理在该领域的研究论文，为利用这一先进AI技术提供了新视角。相关论文列表见文末GitHub链接。
