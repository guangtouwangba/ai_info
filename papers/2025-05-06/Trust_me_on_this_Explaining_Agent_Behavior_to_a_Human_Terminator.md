# "Trust me on this" Explaining Agent Behavior to a Human Terminator

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04592v2

## 原始摘要

Consider a setting where a pre-trained agent is operating in an environment
and a human operator can decide to temporarily terminate its operation and
take-over for some duration of time. These kind of scenarios are common in
human-machine interactions, for example in autonomous driving, factory
automation and healthcare. In these settings, we typically observe a trade-off
between two extreme cases -- if no take-overs are allowed, then the agent might
employ a sub-optimal, possibly dangerous policy. Alternatively, if there are
too many take-overs, then the human has no confidence in the agent, greatly
limiting its usefulness. In this paper, we formalize this setup and propose an
explainability scheme to help optimize the number of human interventions.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了在人机协作场景（如自动驾驶、工业自动化和医疗）中，当预训练智能体运行时人类操作员可临时接管控制的情况。研究指出存在两个极端：完全不允许接管可能导致智能体执行次优或危险策略；而过多接管会降低人类对智能体的信任，削弱其效用。为此，作者提出了一种可解释性方案，旨在优化人类干预次数，平衡智能体自主性和人类监督之间的关系，以提高系统整体性能和可靠性。
