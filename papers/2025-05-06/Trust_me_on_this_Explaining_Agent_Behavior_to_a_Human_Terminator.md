# "Trust me on this" Explaining Agent Behavior to a Human Terminator

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04592v2

## 原始摘要

Consider a setting where a pre-trained agent is operating in an environment
and a human operator can decide to temporarily terminate its operation and
take-over for some duration of time. These kind of scenarios are common in
human-machine interactions, for example in autonomous driving, factory
automation and healthcare. In these settings, we typically observe a trade-off
between two extreme cases -- if no take-overs are allowed, then the agent might
employ a sub-optimal, possibly dangerous policy. Alternatively, if there are
too many take-overs, then the human has no confidence in the agent, greatly
limiting its usefulness. In this paper, we formalize this setup and propose an
explainability scheme to help optimize the number of human interventions.


## AI 摘要

本文研究人机协作中人类接管预训练智能体的优化问题。在自动驾驶、工业自动化和医疗等场景中，完全禁止接管可能导致危险策略，而过多接管又会降低对智能体的信任。作者通过形式化建模，提出了一种可解释性方案来优化人类干预频率，旨在平衡安全性和实用性。该研究为人机协作系统的信任建立和效能优化提供了新思路。
