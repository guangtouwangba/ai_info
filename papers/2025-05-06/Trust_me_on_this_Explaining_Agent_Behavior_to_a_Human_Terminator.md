# "Trust me on this" Explaining Agent Behavior to a Human Terminator

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04592v2

## 原始摘要

Consider a setting where a pre-trained agent is operating in an environment
and a human operator can decide to temporarily terminate its operation and
take-over for some duration of time. These kind of scenarios are common in
human-machine interactions, for example in autonomous driving, factory
automation and healthcare. In these settings, we typically observe a trade-off
between two extreme cases -- if no take-overs are allowed, then the agent might
employ a sub-optimal, possibly dangerous policy. Alternatively, if there are
too many take-overs, then the human has no confidence in the agent, greatly
limiting its usefulness. In this paper, we formalize this setup and propose an
explainability scheme to help optimize the number of human interventions.


## AI 摘要

本文研究预训练智能体在人类可随时接管的环境（如自动驾驶、工业自动化和医疗）中的运行问题。研究发现，完全不允许人类接管可能导致智能体执行次优甚至危险策略，而接管过多则降低人类对智能体的信任，削弱其实用性。作者提出了一种可解释性方案，旨在优化人类干预频率，平衡这两个极端情况。该研究为提升人机协作效率提供了理论框架。
