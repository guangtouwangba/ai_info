# "Trust me on this" Explaining Agent Behavior to a Human Terminator

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04592v2

## 原始摘要

Consider a setting where a pre-trained agent is operating in an environment
and a human operator can decide to temporarily terminate its operation and
take-over for some duration of time. These kind of scenarios are common in
human-machine interactions, for example in autonomous driving, factory
automation and healthcare. In these settings, we typically observe a trade-off
between two extreme cases -- if no take-overs are allowed, then the agent might
employ a sub-optimal, possibly dangerous policy. Alternatively, if there are
too many take-overs, then the human has no confidence in the agent, greatly
limiting its usefulness. In this paper, we formalize this setup and propose an
explainability scheme to help optimize the number of human interventions.


## AI 摘要

本文研究人机协作场景（如自动驾驶、工业自动化和医疗）中人类接管预训练AI代理的优化问题。研究发现两种极端情况：完全不允许接管可能导致AI执行次优或危险策略，而接管过多则降低人类对AI的信任。作者通过形式化建模提出了一种可解释性方案，旨在优化人类干预频率，平衡AI自主性与人类监督之间的关系，从而提高系统整体效能。该研究为人机协作系统的可靠性设计提供了新思路。
