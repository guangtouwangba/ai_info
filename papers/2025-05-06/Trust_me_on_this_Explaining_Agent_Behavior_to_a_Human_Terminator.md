# "Trust me on this" Explaining Agent Behavior to a Human Terminator

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04592v2

## 原始摘要

Consider a setting where a pre-trained agent is operating in an environment
and a human operator can decide to temporarily terminate its operation and
take-over for some duration of time. These kind of scenarios are common in
human-machine interactions, for example in autonomous driving, factory
automation and healthcare. In these settings, we typically observe a trade-off
between two extreme cases -- if no take-overs are allowed, then the agent might
employ a sub-optimal, possibly dangerous policy. Alternatively, if there are
too many take-overs, then the human has no confidence in the agent, greatly
limiting its usefulness. In this paper, we formalize this setup and propose an
explainability scheme to help optimize the number of human interventions.


## AI 摘要

本文研究人机协作场景中人类接管预训练AI代理的优化问题。在自动驾驶、工业自动化和医疗等领域，完全禁止接管可能导致AI执行危险策略，而频繁接管又会降低对AI的信任。作者提出了一种可解释性方案，旨在平衡这两个极端，优化人类干预频率。该方案通过形式化建模，帮助在确保安全性的同时最大化AI的实用价值。
