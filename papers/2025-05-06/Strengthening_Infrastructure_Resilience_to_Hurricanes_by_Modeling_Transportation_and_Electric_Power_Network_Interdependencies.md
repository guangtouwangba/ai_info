# Strengthening Infrastructure Resilience to Hurricanes by Modeling Transportation and Electric Power Network Interdependencies

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12978v2

## 原始摘要

This study presents an agent-based model (ABM) developed to simulate the
resilience of a community to hurricane-induced infrastructure disruptions,
focusing on the interdependencies between electric power and transportation
networks. In this ABM approach, agents represent the components of a system,
where interactions within a system shape intra-dependency of a system and
interactions among systems shape interdependencies. To study household
resilience subject to a hurricane, a library of agents has been created
including electric power network, transportation network, wind/flooding
hazards, and household agents. The ABM is applied over the household and
infrastructure data from a community (Zip code 33147) in Miami-Dade County,
Florida. Interdependencies between the two networks are modeled in two ways,
(i) representing the role of transportation in fuel delivery to power plants
and restoration teams' access, (ii) impact of power outage on transportation
network components. Restoring traffic signals quickly is crucial as their
outage can slow down traffic and increase the chance of crashes. We simulate
three restoration strategies: component based, distance based, and traffic
lights based restoration. The model is validated against Hurricane Irma data,
showing consistent behavior with varying hazard intensities. Scenario analyses
explore the impact of restoration strategies, road accessibility, and wind
speed intensities on power restoration. Results demonstrate that a traffic
lights based restoration strategy efficiently prioritizes signal recovery
without delaying household power restoration time. Restoration of power
services will be faster if restoration teams do not need to wait due to
inaccessible roads and fuel transportation to power plants is not delayed.


## AI 摘要

本研究开发了一个基于智能体(ABM)的模型，模拟飓风灾害下电力与交通网络的相互依赖性对社区韧性的影响。模型包含电网、交通网、灾害和家庭四类智能体，以佛罗里达州迈阿密33147社区为案例，重点分析：(1)交通网络对电厂燃料运输和抢修队通行的影响；(2)停电对交通信号灯等设施的连锁效应。模拟显示：优先恢复交通信号灯的策略既能保障交通安全，又不延误家庭供电；道路通畅和燃料运输效率直接影响抢修速度。模型通过飓风"艾尔玛"数据验证，结果与不同灾害强度下的实际情况一致。
