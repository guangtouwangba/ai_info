# Strengthening Infrastructure Resilience to Hurricanes by Modeling Transportation and Electric Power Network Interdependencies

## 原始摘要

This study presents an agent-based model (ABM) developed to simulate the
resilience of a community to hurricane-induced infrastructure disruptions,
focusing on the interdependencies between electric power and transportation
networks. In this ABM approach, agents represent the components of a system,
where interactions within a system shape intra-dependency of a system and
interactions among systems shape interdependencies. To study household
resilience subject to a hurricane, a library of agents has been created
including electric power network, transportation network, wind/flooding
hazards, and household agents. The ABM is applied over the household and
infrastructure data from a community (Zip code 33147) in Miami-Dade County,
Florida. Interdependencies between the two networks are modeled in two ways,
(i) representing the role of transportation in fuel delivery to power plants
and restoration teams' access, (ii) impact of power outage on transportation
network components. Restoring traffic signals quickly is crucial as their
outage can slow down traffic and increase the chance of crashes. We simulate
three restoration strategies: component based, distance based, and traffic
lights based restoration. The model is validated against Hurricane Irma data,
showing consistent behavior with varying hazard intensities. Scenario analyses
explore the impact of restoration strategies, road accessibility, and wind
speed intensities on power restoration. Results demonstrate that a traffic
lights based restoration strategy efficiently prioritizes signal recovery
without delaying household power restoration time. Restoration of power
services will be faster if restoration teams do not need to wait due to
inaccessible roads and fuel transportation to power plants is not delayed.


## AI 摘要

本研究开发了一个基于智能体的模型(ABM)，模拟社区对飓风引发基础设施中断的恢复能力，重点关注电力与交通网络的相互依赖性。模型包含电力网络、交通网络、风灾/洪水灾害和家庭等智能体，应用于佛罗里达州迈阿密-戴德县33147邮编区域。研究模拟了三种恢复策略：基于组件、距离和交通信号灯的恢复方式。验证显示模型与飓风"Irma"数据一致。情景分析表明，基于交通信号灯的恢复策略能优先恢复信号且不延误家庭供电；道路通畅和燃料运输顺畅可加快电力恢复。交通信号快速恢复对减少事故至关重要。
