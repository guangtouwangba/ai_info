# Strengthening Infrastructure Resilience to Hurricanes by Modeling Transportation and Electric Power Network Interdependencies

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12978v2

## 原始摘要

This study presents an agent-based model (ABM) developed to simulate the
resilience of a community to hurricane-induced infrastructure disruptions,
focusing on the interdependencies between electric power and transportation
networks. In this ABM approach, agents represent the components of a system,
where interactions within a system shape intra-dependency of a system and
interactions among systems shape interdependencies. To study household
resilience subject to a hurricane, a library of agents has been created
including electric power network, transportation network, wind/flooding
hazards, and household agents. The ABM is applied over the household and
infrastructure data from a community (Zip code 33147) in Miami-Dade County,
Florida. Interdependencies between the two networks are modeled in two ways,
(i) representing the role of transportation in fuel delivery to power plants
and restoration teams' access, (ii) impact of power outage on transportation
network components. Restoring traffic signals quickly is crucial as their
outage can slow down traffic and increase the chance of crashes. We simulate
three restoration strategies: component based, distance based, and traffic
lights based restoration. The model is validated against Hurricane Irma data,
showing consistent behavior with varying hazard intensities. Scenario analyses
explore the impact of restoration strategies, road accessibility, and wind
speed intensities on power restoration. Results demonstrate that a traffic
lights based restoration strategy efficiently prioritizes signal recovery
without delaying household power restoration time. Restoration of power
services will be faster if restoration teams do not need to wait due to
inaccessible roads and fuel transportation to power plants is not delayed.


## AI 摘要

这项研究开发了一个基于智能体的模型（ABM），用于模拟社区在飓风引发的电力与交通网络相互依赖关系下的抗灾能力。模型包含电网、交通网、风灾/洪水灾害和家庭智能体，应用于佛罗里达州迈阿密-戴德县33147邮编区域。研究重点模拟了两种网络依赖关系：交通对电厂燃料运输/抢修团队通行的影响，以及停电对交通信号灯等设施的连锁效应。通过对比三种抢修策略（组件优先、距离优先、信号灯优先），发现优先修复交通信号灯的策略既能快速恢复交通，又不延误家庭供电。模型验证显示道路可达性和燃料运输效率会显著影响电力恢复速度。
