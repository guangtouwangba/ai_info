# Strengthening Infrastructure Resilience to Hurricanes by Modeling Transportation and Electric Power Network Interdependencies

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12978v2

## 原始摘要

This study presents an agent-based model (ABM) developed to simulate the
resilience of a community to hurricane-induced infrastructure disruptions,
focusing on the interdependencies between electric power and transportation
networks. In this ABM approach, agents represent the components of a system,
where interactions within a system shape intra-dependency of a system and
interactions among systems shape interdependencies. To study household
resilience subject to a hurricane, a library of agents has been created
including electric power network, transportation network, wind/flooding
hazards, and household agents. The ABM is applied over the household and
infrastructure data from a community (Zip code 33147) in Miami-Dade County,
Florida. Interdependencies between the two networks are modeled in two ways,
(i) representing the role of transportation in fuel delivery to power plants
and restoration teams' access, (ii) impact of power outage on transportation
network components. Restoring traffic signals quickly is crucial as their
outage can slow down traffic and increase the chance of crashes. We simulate
three restoration strategies: component based, distance based, and traffic
lights based restoration. The model is validated against Hurricane Irma data,
showing consistent behavior with varying hazard intensities. Scenario analyses
explore the impact of restoration strategies, road accessibility, and wind
speed intensities on power restoration. Results demonstrate that a traffic
lights based restoration strategy efficiently prioritizes signal recovery
without delaying household power restoration time. Restoration of power
services will be faster if restoration teams do not need to wait due to
inaccessible roads and fuel transportation to power plants is not delayed.


## AI 摘要

这项研究开发了一个基于代理的模型(ABM)，模拟社区在飓风灾害下电力与交通网络相互依赖关系对基础设施中断的恢复能力。模型包含电网、交通网、灾害和家庭代理，应用于佛罗里达州迈阿密-戴德县33147邮编区域。研究模拟了三种恢复策略：基于组件、距离和交通信号灯，验证了与飓风"Irma"数据的一致性。结果表明，优先恢复交通信号的策略能有效提升恢复效率，且不影响家庭供电恢复时间；道路可通行性和燃料运输畅通会显著加快电力恢复速度。研究为灾害恢复策略优化提供了量化分析工具。
