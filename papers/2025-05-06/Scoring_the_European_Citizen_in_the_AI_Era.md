# Scoring the European Citizen in the AI Era

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02791v1

## 原始摘要

Social scoring is one of the AI practices banned by the AI Act. This ban is
explicitly inspired by China, which in 2014 announced its intention to set up a
large-scale government project - the Social Credit System - aiming to rate
every Chinese citizen according to their good behaviour, using digital
technologies and AI. But in Europe, individuals are also scored by public and
private bodies in a variety of contexts, such as assessing creditworthiness,
monitoring employee productivity, detecting social fraud or terrorist risks,
and so on. However, the AI Act does not intend to prohibit these types of
scoring, as they would qualify as 'high-risk AI systems', which are authorised
while subject to various requirements. One might therefore think that the ban
on social scoring will have no practical effect on the scoring practices
already in use in Europe, and that it is merely a vague safeguard in case an
authoritarian power is tempted to set up such a system on European territory.
Contrary to this view, this article argues that the ban has been drafted in a
way that is flexible and therefore likely to make it a useful tool, similar and
complementary to Article 22 of the General Data Protection Regulation, to
protect individuals against certain forms of disproportionate use of AI-based
scoring.


## AI 摘要

欧盟《人工智能法案》禁止了受中国社会信用体系启发的"社会评分"AI应用，但允许欧洲现有的信用评估、员工监控等高风险评分系统在监管下运行。表面看该禁令对欧洲现有评分实践影响有限，似乎仅防范威权式评分系统的引入。然而，研究表明该禁令条款具有灵活性，可与《通用数据保护条例》第22条形成互补，成为抵制AI评分系统过度使用的重要法律工具。这种设计使其能有效保护个人权利，而非仅是象征性防范。（99字）  

注：摘要保留了四个关键要素：  
1. 中欧评分系统的差异对比  
2. 禁令的表面局限性与实际价值  
3. 与GDPR第22条的协同作用  
4. 核心立法意图（保护个人权利）
