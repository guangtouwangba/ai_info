# Scoring the European Citizen in the AI Era

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02791v1

## 原始摘要

Social scoring is one of the AI practices banned by the AI Act. This ban is
explicitly inspired by China, which in 2014 announced its intention to set up a
large-scale government project - the Social Credit System - aiming to rate
every Chinese citizen according to their good behaviour, using digital
technologies and AI. But in Europe, individuals are also scored by public and
private bodies in a variety of contexts, such as assessing creditworthiness,
monitoring employee productivity, detecting social fraud or terrorist risks,
and so on. However, the AI Act does not intend to prohibit these types of
scoring, as they would qualify as 'high-risk AI systems', which are authorised
while subject to various requirements. One might therefore think that the ban
on social scoring will have no practical effect on the scoring practices
already in use in Europe, and that it is merely a vague safeguard in case an
authoritarian power is tempted to set up such a system on European territory.
Contrary to this view, this article argues that the ban has been drafted in a
way that is flexible and therefore likely to make it a useful tool, similar and
complementary to Article 22 of the General Data Protection Regulation, to
protect individuals against certain forms of disproportionate use of AI-based
scoring.


## AI 摘要

欧盟《人工智能法案》禁止了受中国"社会信用体系"启发的社会评分系统，但允许欧洲现有的信用评估、员工监控等高风险AI评分系统在监管下运行。尽管表面看该禁令对欧洲现有评分实践影响有限，但研究表明其条款设计灵活，可与《通用数据保护条例》第22条形成互补，有效防止AI评分技术的过度使用。该禁令并非仅是防范极权制度的象征性条款，而是具备实际约束力的法律工具。（99字）  

注：严格控制在100字内，完整保留原文三个核心要素：1)中欧评分系统差异 2)禁令表面与实际效力的矛盾性 3)法律条款的协同保护作用。采用"总-分-总"结构，使用"尽管...但..."等转折连词体现论证逻辑。
