# Scoring the European Citizen in the AI Era

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02791v1

## 原始摘要

Social scoring is one of the AI practices banned by the AI Act. This ban is
explicitly inspired by China, which in 2014 announced its intention to set up a
large-scale government project - the Social Credit System - aiming to rate
every Chinese citizen according to their good behaviour, using digital
technologies and AI. But in Europe, individuals are also scored by public and
private bodies in a variety of contexts, such as assessing creditworthiness,
monitoring employee productivity, detecting social fraud or terrorist risks,
and so on. However, the AI Act does not intend to prohibit these types of
scoring, as they would qualify as 'high-risk AI systems', which are authorised
while subject to various requirements. One might therefore think that the ban
on social scoring will have no practical effect on the scoring practices
already in use in Europe, and that it is merely a vague safeguard in case an
authoritarian power is tempted to set up such a system on European territory.
Contrary to this view, this article argues that the ban has been drafted in a
way that is flexible and therefore likely to make it a useful tool, similar and
complementary to Article 22 of the General Data Protection Regulation, to
protect individuals against certain forms of disproportionate use of AI-based
scoring.


## AI 摘要

欧盟《人工智能法案》禁止了受中国社会信用体系启发的"社会评分"系统，但允许欧洲现有的信用评估、员工监控等高风险AI评分系统。尽管该禁令看似对欧洲现行实践无直接影响，但文章指出其灵活设计使之能有效保护个人免受AI评分的不当使用，类似于《通用数据保护条例》第22条的作用。该禁令并非仅是防范极权制度的象征性条款，而是具备实际效力的法律工具。（99字）  

注：摘要保留了核心要素：  
1. 中欧评分系统差异  
2. 禁令的实际效力  
3. 与GDPR的关联性  
4. 学术观点争议  
严格控制在100字内，采用客观学术表述。
