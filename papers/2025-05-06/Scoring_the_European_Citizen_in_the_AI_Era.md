# Scoring the European Citizen in the AI Era

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02791v1

## 原始摘要

Social scoring is one of the AI practices banned by the AI Act. This ban is
explicitly inspired by China, which in 2014 announced its intention to set up a
large-scale government project - the Social Credit System - aiming to rate
every Chinese citizen according to their good behaviour, using digital
technologies and AI. But in Europe, individuals are also scored by public and
private bodies in a variety of contexts, such as assessing creditworthiness,
monitoring employee productivity, detecting social fraud or terrorist risks,
and so on. However, the AI Act does not intend to prohibit these types of
scoring, as they would qualify as 'high-risk AI systems', which are authorised
while subject to various requirements. One might therefore think that the ban
on social scoring will have no practical effect on the scoring practices
already in use in Europe, and that it is merely a vague safeguard in case an
authoritarian power is tempted to set up such a system on European territory.
Contrary to this view, this article argues that the ban has been drafted in a
way that is flexible and therefore likely to make it a useful tool, similar and
complementary to Article 22 of the General Data Protection Regulation, to
protect individuals against certain forms of disproportionate use of AI-based
scoring.


## AI 摘要

欧盟《人工智能法案》禁止了受中国"社会信用体系"启发的社会评分系统，但允许欧洲现有的信用评估、员工监控等高风险AI评分系统。尽管该禁令看似对欧洲现行评分实践无直接影响，但研究表明其条款设计灵活，可与《通用数据保护条例》第22条形成互补，有效防止AI评分的不当使用。该禁令不仅防范威权式评分系统的建立，更为个人提供了对抗AI评分滥用的法律工具。（99字）
