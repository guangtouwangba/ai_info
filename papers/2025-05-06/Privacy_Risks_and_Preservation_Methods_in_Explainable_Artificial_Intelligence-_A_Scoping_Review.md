# Privacy Risks and Preservation Methods in Explainable Artificial Intelligence: A Scoping Review

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02828v1

## 原始摘要

Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a pillar of
Trustworthy AI and aims to bring transparency in complex models that are opaque
by nature. Despite the benefits of incorporating explanations in models, an
urgent need is found in addressing the privacy concerns of providing this
additional information to end users. In this article, we conduct a scoping
review of existing literature to elicit details on the conflict between privacy
and explainability. Using the standard methodology for scoping review, we
extracted 57 articles from 1,943 studies published from January 2019 to
December 2024. The review addresses 3 research questions to present readers
with more understanding of the topic: (1) what are the privacy risks of
releasing explanations in AI systems? (2) what current methods have researchers
employed to achieve privacy preservation in XAI systems? (3) what constitutes a
privacy preserving explanation? Based on the knowledge synthesized from the
selected studies, we categorize the privacy risks and preservation methods in
XAI and propose the characteristics of privacy preserving explanations to aid
researchers and practitioners in understanding the requirements of XAI that is
privacy compliant. Lastly, we identify the challenges in balancing privacy with
other system desiderata and provide recommendations for achieving privacy
preserving XAI. We expect that this review will shed light on the complex
relationship of privacy and explainability, both being the fundamental
principles of Trustworthy AI.


## AI 摘要

这篇综述探讨了可解释人工智能(XAI)与隐私保护之间的冲突关系。研究通过系统分析2019-2024年间的57篇文献，回答了三个核心问题：(1)AI系统提供解释可能带来的隐私风险；(2)现有隐私保护XAI方法；(3)隐私保护解释的特征。研究将隐私风险和防护方法进行分类，提出了符合隐私要求的XAI解释特征，同时指出了平衡隐私与其他系统需求的挑战。该综述揭示了可信AI两大基本原则——可解释性与隐私之间的复杂关系，为开发隐私合规的XAI系统提供了指导建议。
