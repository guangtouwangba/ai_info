# Privacy Risks and Preservation Methods in Explainable Artificial Intelligence: A Scoping Review

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02828v1

## 原始摘要

Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a pillar of
Trustworthy AI and aims to bring transparency in complex models that are opaque
by nature. Despite the benefits of incorporating explanations in models, an
urgent need is found in addressing the privacy concerns of providing this
additional information to end users. In this article, we conduct a scoping
review of existing literature to elicit details on the conflict between privacy
and explainability. Using the standard methodology for scoping review, we
extracted 57 articles from 1,943 studies published from January 2019 to
December 2024. The review addresses 3 research questions to present readers
with more understanding of the topic: (1) what are the privacy risks of
releasing explanations in AI systems? (2) what current methods have researchers
employed to achieve privacy preservation in XAI systems? (3) what constitutes a
privacy preserving explanation? Based on the knowledge synthesized from the
selected studies, we categorize the privacy risks and preservation methods in
XAI and propose the characteristics of privacy preserving explanations to aid
researchers and practitioners in understanding the requirements of XAI that is
privacy compliant. Lastly, we identify the challenges in balancing privacy with
other system desiderata and provide recommendations for achieving privacy
preserving XAI. We expect that this review will shed light on the complex
relationship of privacy and explainability, both being the fundamental
principles of Trustworthy AI.


## AI 摘要

可解释人工智能（XAI）作为可信AI的核心，致力于提升复杂模型的透明度，但同时也引发了隐私保护的挑战。本文通过文献综述（2019-2024年57篇研究）揭示了XAI中隐私与可解释性的矛盾：1）解释信息可能泄露敏感数据；2）现有隐私保护方法包括数据脱敏、差分隐私等；3）隐私保护型解释应满足最小披露、可控访问等特性。研究归纳了隐私风险类型和保护技术，提出了平衡系统需求的建议，为开发既透明又合规的XAI系统提供指导。该综述阐明了可信AI两大基础原则——隐私与可解释性间的复杂关系。
