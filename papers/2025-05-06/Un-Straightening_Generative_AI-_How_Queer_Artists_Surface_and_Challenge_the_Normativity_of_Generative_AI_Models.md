# Un-Straightening Generative AI: How Queer Artists Surface and Challenge the Normativity of Generative AI Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09805v2

## 原始摘要

Queer people are often discussed as targets of bias, harm, or discrimination
in research on generative AI. However, the specific ways that queer people
engage with generative AI, and thus possible uses that support queer people,
have yet to be explored. We conducted a workshop study with 13 queer artists,
during which we gave participants access to GPT-4 and DALL-E 3 and facilitated
group sensemaking activities. We found our participants struggled to use these
models due to various normative values embedded in their designs, such as
hyper-positivity and anti-sexuality. We describe various strategies our
participants developed to overcome these models' limitations and how,
nevertheless, our participants found value in these highly-normative
technologies. Drawing on queer feminist theory, we discuss implications for the
conceptualization of "state-of-the-art" models and consider how FAccT
researchers might support queer alternatives.


## AI 摘要

这项研究探讨了13位酷儿艺术家使用GPT-4和DALL-E 3等生成式AI的经历。研究发现，这些AI模型内置的规范性价值观（如过度积极和反性倾向）给酷儿用户带来了使用障碍。尽管如此，参与者仍开发出应对策略并从中获得价值。基于酷儿女性主义理论，研究质疑了"最先进"AI模型的概念，并建议FAccT（公平、问责与透明）研究者应支持酷儿替代方案。该研究揭示了主流AI技术与酷儿群体需求之间的不匹配，同时展示了酷儿用户如何适应这些高度规范化的技术。
