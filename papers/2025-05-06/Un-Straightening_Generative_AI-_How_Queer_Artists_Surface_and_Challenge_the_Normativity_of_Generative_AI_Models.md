# Un-Straightening Generative AI: How Queer Artists Surface and Challenge the Normativity of Generative AI Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09805v2

## 原始摘要

Queer people are often discussed as targets of bias, harm, or discrimination
in research on generative AI. However, the specific ways that queer people
engage with generative AI, and thus possible uses that support queer people,
have yet to be explored. We conducted a workshop study with 13 queer artists,
during which we gave participants access to GPT-4 and DALL-E 3 and facilitated
group sensemaking activities. We found our participants struggled to use these
models due to various normative values embedded in their designs, such as
hyper-positivity and anti-sexuality. We describe various strategies our
participants developed to overcome these models' limitations and how,
nevertheless, our participants found value in these highly-normative
technologies. Drawing on queer feminist theory, we discuss implications for the
conceptualization of "state-of-the-art" models and consider how FAccT
researchers might support queer alternatives.


## AI 摘要

这项研究探讨了13位酷儿艺术家使用GPT-4和DALL-E 3的经历。研究发现，这些AI模型的设计中嵌入了规范性价值观（如过度积极和反性取向），给酷儿用户带来使用障碍。尽管如此，参与者仍开发出应对策略并从中获得价值。研究基于酷儿女性主义理论，对"最先进"AI模型的概念提出质疑，并建议FAccT（公平、问责和透明）研究者支持酷儿替代方案。该工作填补了关于酷儿群体如何主动使用生成式AI的研究空白，揭示了主流AI技术与边缘群体需求间的张力。
