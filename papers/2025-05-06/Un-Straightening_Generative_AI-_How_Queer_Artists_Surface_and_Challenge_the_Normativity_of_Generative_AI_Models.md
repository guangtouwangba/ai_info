# Un-Straightening Generative AI: How Queer Artists Surface and Challenge the Normativity of Generative AI Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09805v2

## 原始摘要

Queer people are often discussed as targets of bias, harm, or discrimination
in research on generative AI. However, the specific ways that queer people
engage with generative AI, and thus possible uses that support queer people,
have yet to be explored. We conducted a workshop study with 13 queer artists,
during which we gave participants access to GPT-4 and DALL-E 3 and facilitated
group sensemaking activities. We found our participants struggled to use these
models due to various normative values embedded in their designs, such as
hyper-positivity and anti-sexuality. We describe various strategies our
participants developed to overcome these models' limitations and how,
nevertheless, our participants found value in these highly-normative
technologies. Drawing on queer feminist theory, we discuss implications for the
conceptualization of "state-of-the-art" models and consider how FAccT
researchers might support queer alternatives.


## AI 摘要

这项研究探讨了酷儿群体与生成式AI的互动方式，发现现有模型（如GPT-4和DALL-E 3）的设计中隐含的规范性价值观（如过度积极和反性倾向）给酷儿艺术家带来使用障碍。通过13位酷儿艺术家的研讨会发现，尽管存在限制，参与者仍开发出应对策略并从中获得价值。研究基于酷儿女性主义理论，反思"最先进"模型的概念，并探讨如何支持酷儿友好的替代方案。研究表明生成式AI需要更多元化的设计以包容不同身份群体。
