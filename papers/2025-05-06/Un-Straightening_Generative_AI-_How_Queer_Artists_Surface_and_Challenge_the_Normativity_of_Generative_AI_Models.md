# Un-Straightening Generative AI: How Queer Artists Surface and Challenge the Normativity of Generative AI Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09805v2

## 原始摘要

Queer people are often discussed as targets of bias, harm, or discrimination
in research on generative AI. However, the specific ways that queer people
engage with generative AI, and thus possible uses that support queer people,
have yet to be explored. We conducted a workshop study with 13 queer artists,
during which we gave participants access to GPT-4 and DALL-E 3 and facilitated
group sensemaking activities. We found our participants struggled to use these
models due to various normative values embedded in their designs, such as
hyper-positivity and anti-sexuality. We describe various strategies our
participants developed to overcome these models' limitations and how,
nevertheless, our participants found value in these highly-normative
technologies. Drawing on queer feminist theory, we discuss implications for the
conceptualization of "state-of-the-art" models and consider how FAccT
researchers might support queer alternatives.


## AI 摘要

这项研究探讨了酷儿群体与生成式AI的互动。通过13位酷儿艺术家的工作坊实验，发现主流AI模型（如GPT-4和DALL-E 3）因内置的规范价值观（如过度积极、反性内容）而难以满足酷儿需求。参与者开发了应对策略，但仍从这些高度规范化的技术中获益。研究基于酷儿女性主义理论，对"最先进"AI模型的概念提出质疑，并思考FAccT（公平、问责、透明）研究如何支持酷儿替代方案。研究揭示了AI设计中的规范性偏见及其对酷儿用户的限制，同时展现了酷儿群体创造性使用AI的可能性。
