# Un-Straightening Generative AI: How Queer Artists Surface and Challenge the Normativity of Generative AI Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09805v2

## 原始摘要

Queer people are often discussed as targets of bias, harm, or discrimination
in research on generative AI. However, the specific ways that queer people
engage with generative AI, and thus possible uses that support queer people,
have yet to be explored. We conducted a workshop study with 13 queer artists,
during which we gave participants access to GPT-4 and DALL-E 3 and facilitated
group sensemaking activities. We found our participants struggled to use these
models due to various normative values embedded in their designs, such as
hyper-positivity and anti-sexuality. We describe various strategies our
participants developed to overcome these models' limitations and how,
nevertheless, our participants found value in these highly-normative
technologies. Drawing on queer feminist theory, we discuss implications for the
conceptualization of "state-of-the-art" models and consider how FAccT
researchers might support queer alternatives.


## AI 摘要

这项研究探讨了LGBTQ+群体与生成式AI（如GPT-4和DALL-E 3）的互动方式。通过13位酷儿艺术家的工作坊发现，参与者因AI设计中隐含的规范性价值观（如过度积极和反性内容）而面临使用障碍。尽管如此，他们仍开发出策略克服限制，并从中获得价值。研究基于酷儿女性主义理论，反思了"最先进"AI模型的概念，并建议FAccT（公平、问责、透明）研究者支持酷儿替代方案。研究填补了生成式AI如何支持而非伤害酷儿群体的空白。
