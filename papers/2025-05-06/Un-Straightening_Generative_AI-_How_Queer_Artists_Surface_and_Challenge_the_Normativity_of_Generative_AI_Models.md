# Un-Straightening Generative AI: How Queer Artists Surface and Challenge the Normativity of Generative AI Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09805v2

## 原始摘要

Queer people are often discussed as targets of bias, harm, or discrimination
in research on generative AI. However, the specific ways that queer people
engage with generative AI, and thus possible uses that support queer people,
have yet to be explored. We conducted a workshop study with 13 queer artists,
during which we gave participants access to GPT-4 and DALL-E 3 and facilitated
group sensemaking activities. We found our participants struggled to use these
models due to various normative values embedded in their designs, such as
hyper-positivity and anti-sexuality. We describe various strategies our
participants developed to overcome these models' limitations and how,
nevertheless, our participants found value in these highly-normative
technologies. Drawing on queer feminist theory, we discuss implications for the
conceptualization of "state-of-the-art" models and consider how FAccT
researchers might support queer alternatives.


## AI 摘要

这项研究探讨了13位酷儿艺术家使用GPT-4和DALL-E 3的经历，发现这些生成式AI模型因内置的规范性价值观(如过度积极、反性倾向)而难以满足酷儿需求。尽管存在限制，参与者仍开发出应对策略并从中获得价值。基于酷儿女性主义理论，研究质疑"最先进"模型的概念，并建议FAccT(公平、问责、透明)研究者支持酷儿替代方案。研究填补了酷儿群体如何主动使用AI而非仅作为受害者的研究空白，揭示了AI设计中的规范性偏见及其对酷儿用户的挑战。
