# Un-Straightening Generative AI: How Queer Artists Surface and Challenge the Normativity of Generative AI Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09805v2

## 原始摘要

Queer people are often discussed as targets of bias, harm, or discrimination
in research on generative AI. However, the specific ways that queer people
engage with generative AI, and thus possible uses that support queer people,
have yet to be explored. We conducted a workshop study with 13 queer artists,
during which we gave participants access to GPT-4 and DALL-E 3 and facilitated
group sensemaking activities. We found our participants struggled to use these
models due to various normative values embedded in their designs, such as
hyper-positivity and anti-sexuality. We describe various strategies our
participants developed to overcome these models' limitations and how,
nevertheless, our participants found value in these highly-normative
technologies. Drawing on queer feminist theory, we discuss implications for the
conceptualization of "state-of-the-art" models and consider how FAccT
researchers might support queer alternatives.


## AI 摘要

这项研究探讨了酷儿群体与生成式AI的互动方式，发现现有模型（如GPT-4和DALL-E 3）的设计中嵌入了规范性价值观（如过度积极和反性倾向），导致13位参与研究的酷儿艺术家使用困难。尽管如此，参与者仍开发出应对策略并从中获得价值。研究基于酷儿女性主义理论，反思了“最先进”模型的概念，并建议FAccT（公平、问责、透明）研究者支持酷儿替代方案，以弥补当前AI技术对酷儿群体支持的不足。研究填补了生成式AI如何服务酷儿群体的空白。
