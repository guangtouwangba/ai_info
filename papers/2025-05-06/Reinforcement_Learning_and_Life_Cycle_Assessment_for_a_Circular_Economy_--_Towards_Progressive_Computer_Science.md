## 原始摘要

The aim of this paper is to discuss the potential of using methods from
Reinforcement Learning for Life Cycle Assessment in a circular economy, and to
present some new ideas in this direction. To give some context, we explain how
Reinforcement Learning was successfully applied in computer chess (and beyond).
As computer chess was historically called the "drosophila of AI", we start by
describing a method for the board representation called 'rotated bitboards'
that can potentially also be applied in the context of sustainability. In the
first part of this paper, the concepts of the bitboard-representation and the
advantages of (rotated) bitboards in move generation are explained. In order to
illustrate those ideas practice, the concrete implementation of the
move-generator in FUSc# (a chess engine developed at FU Berlin in C# some years
ago) is described. In addition, rotated binary neural networks are discussed
briefly.
  The second part deals with reinforcement learning in computer chess (and
beyond). We exemplify the progress that has been made in this field in the last
15-20 years by comparing the "state of the art" from 2002-2008, when FUSc# was
developed, with the ground-breaking innovations connected to "AlphaZero". We
review some application of the ideas developed in AlphaZero in other domains,
e.g. the "other Alphas" like AlphaFold, AlphaTensor, AlphaGeometry and
AlphaProof. In the final part of the paper, we discuss the computer-science
related challenges that changing the economic paradigm towards (absolute)
sustainability poses and in how far what we call 'progressive computer science'
needs to contribute. Concrete challenges include the closing of material loops
in a circular economy with Life Cycle Assessment in order to optimize for
(absolute) sustainability, and we present some new ideas in this direction.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了将强化学习方法应用于循环经济生命周期评估的潜力。作者首先以国际象棋AI(如"旋转位棋盘"技术)为例,说明强化学习的发展历程,比较了早期FUSc#引擎与AlphaZero的突破性进展。随后分析了Alpha系列技术(如AlphaFold等)在其他领域的应用。最后重点讨论了计算机科学在推动经济模式向可持续发展转型中的关键作用,特别是在循环经济中优化材料闭环和生命周期评估方面面临的新挑战,并提出了一些创新思路。全文旨在探索AI技术特别是强化学习在可持续发展领域的应用前景。
