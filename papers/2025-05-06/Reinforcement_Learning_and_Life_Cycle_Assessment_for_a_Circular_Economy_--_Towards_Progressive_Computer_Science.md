# Reinforcement Learning and Life Cycle Assessment for a Circular Economy -- Towards Progressive Computer Science

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10822v3

## 原始摘要

The aim of this paper is to discuss the potential of using methods from
Reinforcement Learning for Life Cycle Assessment in a circular economy, and to
present some new ideas in this direction. To give some context, we explain how
Reinforcement Learning was successfully applied in computer chess (and beyond).
As computer chess was historically called the "drosophila of AI", we start by
describing a method for the board representation called 'rotated bitboards'
that can potentially also be applied in the context of sustainability. In the
first part of this paper, the concepts of the bitboard-representation and the
advantages of (rotated) bitboards in move generation are explained. In order to
illustrate those ideas practice, the concrete implementation of the
move-generator in FUSc# (a chess engine developed at FU Berlin in C# some years
ago) is described. In addition, rotated binary neural networks are discussed
briefly.
  The second part deals with reinforcement learning in computer chess (and
beyond). We exemplify the progress that has been made in this field in the last
15-20 years by comparing the "state of the art" from 2002-2008, when FUSc# was
developed, with the ground-breaking innovations connected to "AlphaZero". We
review some application of the ideas developed in AlphaZero in other domains,
e.g. the "other Alphas" like AlphaFold, AlphaTensor, AlphaGeometry and
AlphaProof. In the final part of the paper, we discuss the computer-science
related challenges that changing the economic paradigm towards (absolute)
sustainability poses and in how far what we call 'progressive computer science'
needs to contribute. Concrete challenges include the closing of material loops
in a circular economy with Life Cycle Assessment in order to optimize for
(absolute) sustainability, and we present some new ideas in this direction.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了强化学习方法在循环经济生命周期评估中的应用潜力。作者首先以国际象棋AI中的"旋转位棋盘"技术为例，说明该表示方法可能适用于可持续发展领域。随后对比了2002-2008年FUSc#象棋引擎与AlphaZero的突破性进展，并概述了Alpha系列在其他领域的应用。最后讨论了向绝对可持续发展转型带来的计算机科学挑战，特别是如何通过生命周期评估优化循环经济的材料闭环系统。论文提出了将强化学习应用于可持续性优化的新思路。
