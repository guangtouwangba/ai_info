## 原始摘要

To combat climate change, individuals are encouraged to adopt sustainable
habits, in particular, with their household, optimizing their electrical
consumption. Conversational agents, such as Smart Home Assistants, hold promise
as effective tools for promoting sustainable practices within households. Our
research investigated the application of Large Language Models (LLM) in
enhancing smart home automation and promoting sustainable household practices,
specifically using the HomeAssistant framework. In particular, it highlights
the potential of GPT models in generating accurate automation routines. While
the LLMs showed proficiency in understanding complex commands and creating
valid JSON outputs, challenges such as syntax errors and message malformations
were noted, indicating areas for further improvement. Still, despite minimal
quantitative differences between "green" and "no green" prompts, qualitative
feedback highlighted a positive shift towards sustainability in the routines
generated with environmentally focused prompts. Then, an empirical evaluation
(N=56) demonstrated that the system was well-received and found engaging by
users compared to its traditional rule-based counterpart. Our findings
highlight the role of LLMs in advancing smart home technologies and suggest
further research to refine these models for broader, real-world applications to
support sustainable living.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了大型语言模型(LLMs)在智能家居自动化中的应用，特别是通过HomeAssistant框架促进家庭可持续实践。结果显示，GPT模型能准确生成自动化程序，理解复杂指令并输出有效JSON，但仍存在语法错误等问题。虽然"环保"与"非环保"提示的量化差异不大，但环保提示能显著提升生成程序的可持续性。用户评估(N=56)表明，与传统规则系统相比，LLM系统更受欢迎且更具吸引力。研究凸显了LLMs在推动智能家居技术发展方面的潜力，建议进一步优化模型以支持可持续生活的实际应用。
