# Generating HomeAssistant Automations Using an LLM-based Chatbot

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02802v1

## 原始摘要

To combat climate change, individuals are encouraged to adopt sustainable
habits, in particular, with their household, optimizing their electrical
consumption. Conversational agents, such as Smart Home Assistants, hold promise
as effective tools for promoting sustainable practices within households. Our
research investigated the application of Large Language Models (LLM) in
enhancing smart home automation and promoting sustainable household practices,
specifically using the HomeAssistant framework. In particular, it highlights
the potential of GPT models in generating accurate automation routines. While
the LLMs showed proficiency in understanding complex commands and creating
valid JSON outputs, challenges such as syntax errors and message malformations
were noted, indicating areas for further improvement. Still, despite minimal
quantitative differences between "green" and "no green" prompts, qualitative
feedback highlighted a positive shift towards sustainability in the routines
generated with environmentally focused prompts. Then, an empirical evaluation
(N=56) demonstrated that the system was well-received and found engaging by
users compared to its traditional rule-based counterpart. Our findings
highlight the role of LLMs in advancing smart home technologies and suggest
further research to refine these models for broader, real-world applications to
support sustainable living.


## AI 摘要

这项研究探讨了利用大型语言模型（LLM）提升智能家居自动化并促进家庭可持续实践的潜力。研究基于HomeAssistant框架，发现GPT模型能准确生成自动化程序，理解复杂指令并输出有效JSON，但仍存在语法错误等问题。尽管"绿色"提示与普通提示在量化差异上不明显，但定性反馈显示环保导向的提示能促进可持续性习惯。一项用户评估（N=56）表明，相比传统规则系统，该LLM方案更受用户欢迎。研究凸显了LLM推动智能家居技术发展的潜力，建议进一步优化模型以支持可持续生活的实际应用。（100字）
