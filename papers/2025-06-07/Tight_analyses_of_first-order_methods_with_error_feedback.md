# Tight analyses of first-order methods with error feedback

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05271v1

## 原始摘要

Communication between agents often constitutes a major computational
bottleneck in distributed learning. One of the most common mitigation
strategies is to compress the information exchanged, thereby reducing
communication overhead. To counteract the degradation in convergence associated
with compressed communication, error feedback schemes -- most notably
$\mathrm{EF}$ and $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$ -- were introduced. In this work, we
provide a tight analysis of both of these methods. Specifically, we find the
Lyapunov function that yields the best possible convergence rate for each
method -- with matching lower bounds. This principled approach yields sharp
performance guarantees and enables a rigorous, apples-to-apples comparison
between $\mathrm{EF}$, $\mathrm{EF}^{21}$, and compressed gradient descent. Our
analysis is carried out in a simplified yet representative setting, which
allows for clean theoretical insights and fair comparison of the underlying
mechanisms.
