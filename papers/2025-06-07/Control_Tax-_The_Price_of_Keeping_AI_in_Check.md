# Control Tax: The Price of Keeping AI in Check

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05296v1

## 原始摘要

The rapid integration of agentic AI into high-stakes real-world applications
requires robust oversight mechanisms. The emerging field of AI Control (AIC)
aims to provide such an oversight mechanism, but practical adoption depends
heavily on implementation overhead. To study this problem better, we introduce
the notion of Control tax -- the operational and financial cost of integrating
control measures into AI pipelines. Our work makes three key contributions to
the field of AIC: (1) we introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the
Control Tax and maps classifier performance to safety assurances; (2) we
conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in
adversarial settings, where attacker models insert subtle backdoors into code
while monitoring models attempt to detect these vulnerabilities; and (3) we
provide empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols and develop
optimized monitoring strategies that balance safety and cost-effectiveness
while accounting for practical constraints like auditing budgets. Our framework
enables practitioners to make informed decisions by systematically connecting
safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AIC through principled economic
feasibility assessment across different deployment contexts.


## AI 摘要

随着AI在关键领域应用的快速普及，亟需建立有效的监管机制。AI控制领域（AIC）应运而生，但其实施成本成为关键制约因素。本研究提出"控制税"概念，量化AI管道中控制措施的操作与财务成本，主要贡献包括：1）建立理论框架，将分类器性能映射至安全保障；2）在对抗环境下评估先进语言模型，研究攻击模型植入后门与监测模型识别的动态；3）提供控制协议的成本估算，并开发兼顾安全性与成本效益的优化监测策略。该框架通过系统关联安全保证与实施成本，为不同场景下的经济可行性评估提供决策依据。（100字）
