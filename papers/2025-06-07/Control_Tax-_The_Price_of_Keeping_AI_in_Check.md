# Control Tax: The Price of Keeping AI in Check

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05296v1

## 原始摘要

The rapid integration of agentic AI into high-stakes real-world applications
requires robust oversight mechanisms. The emerging field of AI Control (AIC)
aims to provide such an oversight mechanism, but practical adoption depends
heavily on implementation overhead. To study this problem better, we introduce
the notion of Control tax -- the operational and financial cost of integrating
control measures into AI pipelines. Our work makes three key contributions to
the field of AIC: (1) we introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the
Control Tax and maps classifier performance to safety assurances; (2) we
conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in
adversarial settings, where attacker models insert subtle backdoors into code
while monitoring models attempt to detect these vulnerabilities; and (3) we
provide empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols and develop
optimized monitoring strategies that balance safety and cost-effectiveness
while accounting for practical constraints like auditing budgets. Our framework
enables practitioners to make informed decisions by systematically connecting
safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AIC through principled economic
feasibility assessment across different deployment contexts.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文提出了"控制税"(Control Tax)的概念，即在高风险AI应用中实施安全控制措施所需的操作和财务成本。研究团队建立了量化控制税的理论框架，将分类器性能与安全保证相关联；评估了先进语言模型在对抗性环境下的表现，其中攻击模型会植入隐蔽后门，而监控模型则试图检测漏洞；还提供了控制协议的实际成本估算，并开发了平衡安全性与成本效益的优化监控策略。该框架通过系统连接安全保证与其成本，帮助从业者做出明智决策，推动AI控制领域的发展。
