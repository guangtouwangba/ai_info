# Control Tax: The Price of Keeping AI in Check

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05296v1

## 原始摘要

The rapid integration of agentic AI into high-stakes real-world applications
requires robust oversight mechanisms. The emerging field of AI Control (AIC)
aims to provide such an oversight mechanism, but practical adoption depends
heavily on implementation overhead. To study this problem better, we introduce
the notion of Control tax -- the operational and financial cost of integrating
control measures into AI pipelines. Our work makes three key contributions to
the field of AIC: (1) we introduce a theoretical framework that quantifies the
Control Tax and maps classifier performance to safety assurances; (2) we
conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art language models in
adversarial settings, where attacker models insert subtle backdoors into code
while monitoring models attempt to detect these vulnerabilities; and (3) we
provide empirical financial cost estimates for control protocols and develop
optimized monitoring strategies that balance safety and cost-effectiveness
while accounting for practical constraints like auditing budgets. Our framework
enables practitioners to make informed decisions by systematically connecting
safety guarantees with their costs, advancing AIC through principled economic
feasibility assessment across different deployment contexts.


## AI 摘要

本文提出"控制税"概念，用于衡量AI控制措施的实施成本，为AI监管提供新框架。研究通过三方面贡献推进AI控制领域：1）建立量化控制税的理论框架，将分类器性能映射到安全保证；2）在对抗环境下评估先进语言模型，研究攻击模型植入后门与监控模型检测的对抗；3）估算控制协议的实际成本，开发兼顾安全性与成本效益的优化监控策略。该框架系统连接安全保证与成本，帮助从业者在预算等实际约束下做出明智决策，通过经济可行性评估推动AI控制在不同场景中的应用。
