# Time to Talk: LLM Agents for Asynchronous Group Communication in Mafia Games

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05309v1

## 原始摘要

LLMs are used predominantly in synchronous communication, where a human user
and a model communicate in alternating turns. In contrast, many real-world
settings are inherently asynchronous. For example, in group chats, online team
meetings, or social games, there is no inherent notion of turns; therefore, the
decision of when to speak forms a crucial part of the participant's decision
making. In this work, we develop an adaptive asynchronous LLM-agent which, in
addition to determining what to say, also decides when to say it. To evaluate
our agent, we collect a unique dataset of online Mafia games, including both
human participants, as well as our asynchronous agent. Overall, our agent
performs on par with human players, both in game performance, as well as in its
ability to blend in with the other human players. Our analysis shows that the
agent's behavior in deciding when to speak closely mirrors human patterns,
although differences emerge in message content. We release all our data and
code to support and encourage further research for more realistic asynchronous
communication between LLM agents. This work paves the way for integration of
LLMs into realistic human group settings, from assistance in team discussions
to educational and professional environments where complex social dynamics must
be navigated.


## AI 摘要

该研究开发了一种自适应异步LLM智能体，不仅能决定发言内容，还能判断发言时机。研究通过在线"狼人杀"游戏收集数据集，包含人类玩家和该智能体的互动数据。结果显示，智能体在游戏表现和融入人类玩家方面与人类相当，其发言时机决策与人类模式高度相似，但发言内容存在差异。该工作为LLM融入真实人类群体场景（如团队讨论、教育及专业环境）奠定了基础，并公开了所有数据和代码以促进异步通信研究。这项研究推动了LLM在复杂社交动态场景中的应用发展。
