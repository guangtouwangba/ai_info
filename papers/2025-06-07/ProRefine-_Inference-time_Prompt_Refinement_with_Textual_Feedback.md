# ProRefine: Inference-time Prompt Refinement with Textual Feedback

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05305v1

## 原始摘要

Agentic workflows, where multiple AI agents collaborate to accomplish complex
tasks like reasoning or planning, are becoming increasingly prevalent. However,
these workflows often suffer from error propagation and sub-optimal
performance, largely due to poorly designed prompts that fail to effectively
guide individual agents. This is a critical problem because it limits the
reliability and scalability of these powerful systems. We introduce ProRefine,
an innovative inference-time prompt optimization method that leverages textual
feedback from large language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. ProRefine
dynamically refines prompts for multi-step reasoning tasks without additional
training or ground truth labels. Evaluated on five benchmark mathematical
reasoning datasets, ProRefine significantly surpasses zero-shot
Chain-of-Thought baselines by 3 to 37 percentage points. This approach not only
boosts accuracy but also allows smaller models to match the performance of
larger ones, highlighting its potential for efficient and scalable AI
deployment, and democratizing access to high-performing AI.


## AI 摘要

随着多智能体协作工作流的普及，错误传播和性能不足的问题日益凸显，主要源于低效的提示设计。为此，研究团队提出ProRefine方法，利用大语言模型的文本反馈动态优化推理任务的提示，无需额外训练或真实标签。在五个数学推理基准测试中，ProRefine比零样本思维链基线高出3-37个百分点，显著提升准确性，使小模型也能媲美大模型性能。这一创新不仅提高了系统可靠性，还降低了高性能AI的使用门槛，为规模化部署提供了高效解决方案。
