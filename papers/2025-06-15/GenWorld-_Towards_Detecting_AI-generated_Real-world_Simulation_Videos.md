## 原始摘要

The flourishing of video generation technologies has endangered the
credibility of real-world information and intensified the demand for
AI-generated video detectors. Despite some progress, the lack of high-quality
real-world datasets hinders the development of trustworthy detectors. In this
paper, we propose GenWorld, a large-scale, high-quality, and real-world
simulation dataset for AI-generated video detection. GenWorld features the
following characteristics: (1) Real-world Simulation: GenWorld focuses on
videos that replicate real-world scenarios, which have a significant impact due
to their realism and potential influence; (2) High Quality: GenWorld employs
multiple state-of-the-art video generation models to provide realistic and
high-quality forged videos; (3) Cross-prompt Diversity: GenWorld includes
videos generated from diverse generators and various prompt modalities (e.g.,
text, image, video), offering the potential to learn more generalizable
forensic features. We analyze existing methods and find they fail to detect
high-quality videos generated by world models (i.e., Cosmos), revealing
potential drawbacks of ignoring real-world clues. To address this, we propose a
simple yet effective model, SpannDetector, to leverage multi-view consistency
as a strong criterion for real-world AI-generated video detection. Experiments
show that our method achieves superior results, highlighting a promising
direction for explainable AI-generated video detection based on physical
plausibility. We believe that GenWorld will advance the field of AI-generated
video detection. Project Page: https://chen-wl20.github.io/GenWorld


## AI 摘要

随着视频生成技术的快速发展，AI生成视频的检测需求日益迫切。现有方法因缺乏高质量真实场景数据集而受限。为此，研究者提出了GenWorld数据集，其特点包括：(1) 真实场景模拟；(2) 采用多款先进视频生成模型；(3) 包含跨提示多样性。研究发现现有方法难以检测世界模型(如Cosmos)生成的高质量视频。为此，团队提出SpannDetector模型，利用多视角一致性作为检测标准，实验证明该方法效果显著，为基于物理合理性的可解释AI视频检测提供了新方向。GenWorld有望推动AI生成视频检测领域发展。
