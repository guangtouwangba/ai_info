# Dynamic Epistemic Friction in Dialogue

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10934v1

## 原始摘要

Recent developments in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human
preferences have significantly enhanced their utility in human-AI collaborative
scenarios. However, such approaches often neglect the critical role of
"epistemic friction," or the inherent resistance encountered when updating
beliefs in response to new, conflicting, or ambiguous information. In this
paper, we define dynamic epistemic friction as the resistance to epistemic
integration, characterized by the misalignment between an agent's current
belief state and new propositions supported by external evidence. We position
this within the framework of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (Van Benthem and Pacuit,
2011), where friction emerges as nontrivial belief-revision during the
interaction. We then present analyses from a situated collaborative task that
demonstrate how this model of epistemic friction can effectively predict belief
updates in dialogues, and we subsequently discuss how the model of belief
alignment as a measure of epistemic resistance or friction can naturally be
made more sophisticated to accommodate the complexities of real-world dialogue
scenarios.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了在人类与AI协作中，大型语言模型（LLM）与人类偏好对齐时忽视的"认知摩擦"问题。认知摩擦指智能体在面对新信息时更新信念的固有阻力，表现为现有信念与外部证据支持的新命题之间的错位。研究基于动态认知逻辑框架，将这种摩擦视为交互过程中的非平凡信念修正。通过协作任务分析，该模型能有效预测对话中的信念更新。研究还讨论了如何通过衡量认知阻力或摩擦来完善信念对齐模型，以适应现实对话场景的复杂性。
