# AutoMind: Adaptive Knowledgeable Agent for Automated Data Science

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10974v1

## 原始摘要

Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing
real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to
automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world
effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined
workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on
relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical
expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this
work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework
that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated
expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an
agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores
possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically
tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data
science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance
versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable
effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting
AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.


## AI 摘要

大型语言模型（LLM）代理在解决数据科学问题方面潜力巨大，但现有框架依赖固定流程和编码策略，仅适用于简单任务。AutoMind提出了一种自适应框架，通过三个关键改进克服这些局限：（1）基于专家知识库增强领域专业性；（2）采用树搜索算法策略性探索解决方案；（3）自适应编码策略动态调整代码生成。测试表明，AutoMind在自动化数据科学基准测试中优于现有方法，展现出高效性、鲁棒性和优质解决方案生成能力，推动了全自动化数据科学的发展。
