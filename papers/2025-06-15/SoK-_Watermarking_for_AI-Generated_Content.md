# SoK: Watermarking for AI-Generated Content

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18479v3

## 原始摘要

As the outputs of generative AI (GenAI) techniques improve in quality, it
becomes increasingly challenging to distinguish them from human-created
content. Watermarking schemes are a promising approach to address the problem
of distinguishing between AI and human-generated content. These schemes embed
hidden signals within AI-generated content to enable reliable detection. While
watermarking is not a silver bullet for addressing all risks associated with
GenAI, it can play a crucial role in enhancing AI safety and trustworthiness by
combating misinformation and deception. This paper presents a comprehensive
overview of watermarking techniques for GenAI, beginning with the need for
watermarking from historical and regulatory perspectives. We formalize the
definitions and desired properties of watermarking schemes and examine the key
objectives and threat models for existing approaches. Practical evaluation
strategies are also explored, providing insights into the development of robust
watermarking techniques capable of resisting various attacks. Additionally, we
review recent representative works, highlight open challenges, and discuss
potential directions for this emerging field. By offering a thorough
understanding of watermarking in GenAI, this work aims to guide researchers in
advancing watermarking methods and applications, and support policymakers in
addressing the broader implications of GenAI.


## AI 摘要

随着生成式AI（GenAI）输出质量的提升，区分AI与人类生成内容变得愈发困难。数字水印技术通过嵌入隐藏信号实现可靠检测，成为解决该问题的有效方法。尽管水印并非应对GenAI所有风险的万能方案，但它在打击虚假信息、增强AI安全性和可信度方面发挥关键作用。本文系统综述了GenAI水印技术，涵盖历史与监管需求、水印定义与特性、核心目标与威胁模型，并探讨了抗攻击的实用评估策略。同时总结了代表性研究、现存挑战及未来方向，旨在为研究者提供方法指导，并为政策制定者应对GenAI影响提供参考。（99字）
