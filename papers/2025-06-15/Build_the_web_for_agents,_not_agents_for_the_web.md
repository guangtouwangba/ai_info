# Build the web for agents, not agents for the web

## 原始摘要

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.


## AI 摘要

这篇立场论文提出，当前基于大语言模型（LLM）的网页代理面临核心挑战：人类设计的界面与AI能力不匹配。现有方法（如处理DOM树、截图增强或API交互）存在固有缺陷。作者主张范式转变，建议开发专为AI优化的"代理式网页界面"（AWI），而非让AI适应人类界面。AWI设计遵循六大原则（安全性、效率、标准化等），兼顾各方利益相关者。这种重构旨在突破现有界面限制，推动更高效、可靠、透明的网页代理发展，需要机器学习社区的广泛协作。这一新范式有望从根本上提升AI在网页环境中的自主任务完成能力。
