# Build the web for agents, not agents for the web

## 原始摘要

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.


## AI 摘要

当前大语言模型（LLM）和多模态技术的发展推动了网页代理（Web Agent）的研究，但现有方法面临网页界面与LLM能力不匹配的挑战。本文提出转向开发专为代理优化的新型交互范式——**Agentic Web Interface (AWI)**，其设计遵循安全性、高效性和标准化等六项原则，旨在协调各方利益。AWI通过避免依赖DOM树解析、截图或API绕行，直接适配代理需求，从而提升任务执行的效率与可靠性。这一变革需机器学习社区协作推进，为网页代理提供更透明、可持续的解决方案。
