# Build the web for agents, not agents for the web

## 原始摘要

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.


## AI 摘要

这篇立场论文提出，当前基于大语言模型（LLM）的网络代理面临人机界面不匹配的根本挑战。作者主张转变研究范式，建议开发专为AI代理优化的新型网络交互界面——Agentic Web Interface（AWI）。AWI设计遵循六大原则，强调安全性、效率和标准化，旨在克服现有界面的局限性。这种重构将促进更高效、可靠和透明的网络代理设计，需要机器学习社区的广泛协作。该方案不再强迫AI适应人类界面，而是创建专为代理能力优化的交互范式，有望解决现有方法处理DOM树、截图或API交互时的固有缺陷。
