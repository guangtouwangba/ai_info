# Build the web for agents, not agents for the web

## 原始摘要

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal
counterparts have spurred significant interest in developing web agents -- AI
systems capable of autonomously navigating and completing tasks within web
environments. While holding tremendous promise for automating complex web
interactions, current approaches face substantial challenges due to the
fundamental mismatch between human-designed interfaces and LLM capabilities.
Current methods struggle with the inherent complexity of web inputs, whether
processing massive DOM trees, relying on screenshots augmented with additional
information, or bypassing the user interface entirely through API interactions.
This position paper advocates for a paradigm shift in web agent research:
rather than forcing web agents to adapt to interfaces designed for humans, we
should develop a new interaction paradigm specifically optimized for agentic
capabilities. To this end, we introduce the concept of an Agentic Web Interface
(AWI), an interface specifically designed for agents to navigate a website. We
establish six guiding principles for AWI design, emphasizing safety,
efficiency, and standardization, to account for the interests of all primary
stakeholders. This reframing aims to overcome fundamental limitations of
existing interfaces, paving the way for more efficient, reliable, and
transparent web agent design, which will be a collaborative effort involving
the broader ML community.


## AI 摘要

这篇立场论文主张改变网页代理研究的范式：与其让人工智能适应人类设计的界面，不如开发专为AI优化的新型交互界面——Agentic Web Interface (AWI)。针对当前大型语言模型在处理网页DOM树、截图或API交互时面临的挑战，AWI提出六大设计原则，强调安全性、效率和标准化，以平衡各方利益。这种重构旨在突破现有界面的根本限制，推动更高效、可靠和透明的网页代理设计，需要机器学习社区的广泛协作。该方案为自动化复杂网页交互提供了新思路，将显著提升AI在网页环境中的自主任务完成能力。
