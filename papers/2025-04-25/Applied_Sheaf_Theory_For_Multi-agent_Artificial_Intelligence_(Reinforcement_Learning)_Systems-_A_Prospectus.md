# Applied Sheaf Theory For Multi-agent Artificial Intelligence (Reinforcement Learning) Systems: A Prospectus

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17700v1

## 原始摘要

This paper provides a pedagogical introduction to classical sheaf theory and
sheaf cohomology, followed by a research prospectus exploring potential
applications to multi-agent artificial intelligence systems. The first section
offers a comprehensive overview of fundamental sheaf-theoretic
concepts-presheaves, sheaves, stalks, and cohomology-aimed at researchers in
computer science and AI who may not have extensive background in algebraic
topology. The second section presents a detailed research prospectus that
outlines a roadmap for developing sheaf-theoretic approaches to model and
analyze complex systems of interacting agents. We propose that sheaf theory's
inherent local-to-global perspective may provide valuable mathematical tools
for reasoning about how local agent behaviors collectively determine emergent
system properties. The third section contains a literature review connecting
sheaf theory with existing research in multi-agent systems, reinforcement
learning, and economic modeling. This paper does not present a completed model
but rather lays theoretical groundwork and identifies promising research
directions that could bridge abstract mathematics with practical AI
applications, potentially revealing new approaches to coordination and
emergence in multi-agent systems.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文分三部分介绍了层论及其在多智能体AI系统中的潜在应用。第一部分为计算机科学和AI研究者提供层论基础概念(预层、层、茎、上同调)的教学导引；第二部分提出研究展望，探讨如何用层论的"局部到全局"视角建模和分析多智能体系统，研究局部行为如何涌现系统特性；第三部分综述层论与多智能体系统、强化学习和经济模型的现有研究关联。论文旨在建立理论框架，指出连接抽象数学与AI应用的研究方向，为多智能体系统的协调与涌现现象提供新思路。
