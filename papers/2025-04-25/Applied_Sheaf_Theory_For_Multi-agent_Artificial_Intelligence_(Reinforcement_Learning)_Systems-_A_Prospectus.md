# Applied Sheaf Theory For Multi-agent Artificial Intelligence (Reinforcement Learning) Systems: A Prospectus

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17700v1

## 原始摘要

This paper provides a pedagogical introduction to classical sheaf theory and
sheaf cohomology, followed by a research prospectus exploring potential
applications to multi-agent artificial intelligence systems. The first section
offers a comprehensive overview of fundamental sheaf-theoretic
concepts-presheaves, sheaves, stalks, and cohomology-aimed at researchers in
computer science and AI who may not have extensive background in algebraic
topology. The second section presents a detailed research prospectus that
outlines a roadmap for developing sheaf-theoretic approaches to model and
analyze complex systems of interacting agents. We propose that sheaf theory's
inherent local-to-global perspective may provide valuable mathematical tools
for reasoning about how local agent behaviors collectively determine emergent
system properties. The third section contains a literature review connecting
sheaf theory with existing research in multi-agent systems, reinforcement
learning, and economic modeling. This paper does not present a completed model
but rather lays theoretical groundwork and identifies promising research
directions that could bridge abstract mathematics with practical AI
applications, potentially revealing new approaches to coordination and
emergence in multi-agent systems.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文首先介绍了层论与层上同调的基本概念（预层、层、茎、上同调），旨在为计算机科学和AI领域研究者提供代数拓扑学基础。随后提出研究展望，探讨如何利用层论的"局部到整体"视角来建模和分析多智能体系统，研究局部行为如何涌现出全局特性。最后通过文献综述将层论与多智能体系统、强化学习和经济模型等领域联系起来。论文未提出完整模型，而是为连接抽象数学与AI应用奠定理论基础，指出了可能带来多智能体系统协调与涌现研究新方向的发展路径。
