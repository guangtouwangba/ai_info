# Applied Sheaf Theory For Multi-agent Artificial Intelligence (Reinforcement Learning) Systems: A Prospectus

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17700v1

## 原始摘要

This paper provides a pedagogical introduction to classical sheaf theory and
sheaf cohomology, followed by a research prospectus exploring potential
applications to multi-agent artificial intelligence systems. The first section
offers a comprehensive overview of fundamental sheaf-theoretic
concepts-presheaves, sheaves, stalks, and cohomology-aimed at researchers in
computer science and AI who may not have extensive background in algebraic
topology. The second section presents a detailed research prospectus that
outlines a roadmap for developing sheaf-theoretic approaches to model and
analyze complex systems of interacting agents. We propose that sheaf theory's
inherent local-to-global perspective may provide valuable mathematical tools
for reasoning about how local agent behaviors collectively determine emergent
system properties. The third section contains a literature review connecting
sheaf theory with existing research in multi-agent systems, reinforcement
learning, and economic modeling. This paper does not present a completed model
but rather lays theoretical groundwork and identifies promising research
directions that could bridge abstract mathematics with practical AI
applications, potentially revealing new approaches to coordination and
emergence in multi-agent systems.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文首先介绍了层论和层上同调的基本概念（预层、层、茎、上同调），面向缺乏代数拓扑背景的计算机科学和AI研究者。随后提出了一个研究展望，探讨如何用层论的局部-全局视角建模和分析多智能体系统，认为该方法可能为理解局部行为如何涌现系统特性提供新工具。最后综述了层论与多智能体系统、强化学习和经济模型的现有研究联系。论文旨在建立理论基础并指出潜在研究方向，以连接抽象数学与AI应用，为多智能体系统的协调和涌现现象提供新思路。（100字）
