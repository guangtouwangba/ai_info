# The Role of Prescreening in Auctions with Predictions

## 原始摘要

Auctioneers often use closed auctions to create scarcity and prestige, aiming
to intensify competition among a select group of high-status bidders. Advances
in machine learning and AI make this strategy increasingly viable, enabling
cost-effective identification of capable participants. In this paper, we
develop a theoretical model to assess whether such practice can be justified
from an economic perspective. We consider a setting in which bidders have
i.i.d. private valuations, and the auction designer observes a noisy predictor
of each bidder's valuation, which is assumed to be fully informative with some
probability. Based on this noisy predictor, the designer determines how many
bidders to admit -- a process we refer to as prescreening. We show that an
auction with prescreening is equivalent to a standard auction (i.e., without
prescreening) in which bidder valuations are correlated. Notably, the standard
notion of affiliation commonly assumed in the auction literature does not
generally hold in this equivalent formulation. We characterize conditions for
the existence of symmetric and strictly monotone equilibrium strategies across
three classical auction formats: all-pay, first-price, and second-price
auctions. Our results demonstrate that prescreening with noisy predictors can
significantly enhance revenue in all-pay auctions; in fact, with a perfect
predictor, admitting only two bidders is optimal. By contrast, in both
first-price and second-price auctions, admitting all bidders remains
revenue-maximizing.


## AI 摘要

本文通过理论模型分析了拍卖中预筛选策略的经济合理性。研究发现，基于噪声预测器的预筛选拍卖等同于竞标者估值相关的标准拍卖，但传统关联性假设在此不成立。研究确定了全支付、首价和次价拍卖中存在对称严格单调均衡策略的条件。结果表明，预筛选能显著提升全支付拍卖的收益（完美预测时仅需2名竞标者即可最优），但在首价和次价拍卖中，允许所有竞标者参与仍是收益最大化的选择。这为拍卖设计者利用AI技术优化竞标者筛选提供了理论依据。
