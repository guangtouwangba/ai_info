# The Role of Prescreening in Auctions with Predictions

## 原始摘要

Auctioneers often use closed auctions to create scarcity and prestige, aiming
to intensify competition among a select group of high-status bidders. Advances
in machine learning and AI make this strategy increasingly viable, enabling
cost-effective identification of capable participants. In this paper, we
develop a theoretical model to assess whether such practice can be justified
from an economic perspective. We consider a setting in which bidders have
i.i.d. private valuations, and the auction designer observes a noisy predictor
of each bidder's valuation, which is assumed to be fully informative with some
probability. Based on this noisy predictor, the designer determines how many
bidders to admit -- a process we refer to as prescreening. We show that an
auction with prescreening is equivalent to a standard auction (i.e., without
prescreening) in which bidder valuations are correlated. Notably, the standard
notion of affiliation commonly assumed in the auction literature does not
generally hold in this equivalent formulation. We characterize conditions for
the existence of symmetric and strictly monotone equilibrium strategies across
three classical auction formats: all-pay, first-price, and second-price
auctions. Our results demonstrate that prescreening with noisy predictors can
significantly enhance revenue in all-pay auctions; in fact, with a perfect
predictor, admitting only two bidders is optimal. By contrast, in both
first-price and second-price auctions, admitting all bidders remains
revenue-maximizing.


## AI 摘要

拍卖行常采用封闭拍卖制造稀缺性和提升声望，以刺激高价值竞标者间的竞争。本文通过理论模型评估这种预筛选策略的经济合理性。研究发现，基于噪声预测的预筛选拍卖等同于竞标者估值相关的标准拍卖，但传统关联性假设通常不成立。研究分析了全支付、第一价格和第二价格拍卖的均衡策略条件，结果显示：全支付拍卖中预筛选能显著提升收益（完美预测时仅需两名竞标者即可实现最优），而第一价格和第二价格拍卖中允许所有竞标者参与仍是收益最大化的选择。
