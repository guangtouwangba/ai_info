# The Role of Prescreening in Auctions with Predictions

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12117v2

## 原始摘要

Auctioneers often use closed auctions to create scarcity and prestige, aiming
to intensify competition among a select group of high-status bidders. Advances
in machine learning and AI make this strategy increasingly viable, enabling
cost-effective identification of capable participants. In this paper, we
develop a theoretical model to assess whether such practice can be justified
from an economic perspective. We consider a setting in which bidders have
i.i.d. private valuations, and the auction designer observes a noisy predictor
of each bidder's valuation, which is assumed to be fully informative with some
probability. Based on this noisy predictor, the designer determines how many
bidders to admit -- a process we refer to as prescreening. We show that an
auction with prescreening is equivalent to a standard auction (i.e., without
prescreening) in which bidder valuations are correlated. Notably, the standard
notion of affiliation commonly assumed in the auction literature does not
generally hold in this equivalent formulation. We characterize conditions for
the existence of symmetric and strictly monotone equilibrium strategies across
three classical auction formats: all-pay, first-price, and second-price
auctions. Our results demonstrate that prescreening with noisy predictors can
significantly enhance revenue in all-pay auctions; in fact, with a perfect
predictor, admitting only two bidders is optimal. By contrast, in both
first-price and second-price auctions, admitting all bidders remains
revenue-maximizing.


## AI 摘要

拍卖行常采用封闭拍卖制造稀缺性与声望，以激发高价值竞标者间的竞争。本研究通过理论模型分析，在竞标者估值独立同分布且拍卖方可观测含噪估值预测的条件下，探讨预筛选竞标者数量的经济合理性。研究发现：预筛选拍卖等价于估值相关的标准拍卖，但传统关联性假设不成立。研究确立了全支付、第一价格和第二价格拍卖中对称严格单调均衡策略的存在条件。关键结论显示，全支付拍卖中预筛选能显著提升收益（完美预测时仅需2名竞标者），而第一/第二价格拍卖则需接纳全部竞标者以实现收益最大化。
