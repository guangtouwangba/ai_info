# Demonstrating CavePI: Autonomous Exploration of Underwater Caves by Semantic Guidance

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05384v4

## 原始摘要

Enabling autonomous robots to safely and efficiently navigate, explore, and
map underwater caves is of significant importance to water resource management,
hydrogeology, archaeology, and marine robotics. In this work, we demonstrate
the system design and algorithmic integration of a visual servoing framework
for semantically guided autonomous underwater cave exploration. We present the
hardware and edge-AI design considerations to deploy this framework on a novel
AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) named CavePI. The guided navigation is
driven by a computationally light yet robust deep visual perception module,
delivering a rich semantic understanding of the environment. Subsequently, a
robust control mechanism enables CavePI to track the semantic guides and
navigate within complex cave structures. We evaluate the system through field
experiments in natural underwater caves and spring-water sites and further
validate its ROS (Robot Operating System)-based digital twin in a simulation
environment. Our results highlight how these integrated design choices
facilitate reliable navigation under feature-deprived, GPS-denied, and
low-visibility conditions.
