# Conversational Assistants to support Heart Failure Patients: comparing a Neurosymbolic Architecture with ChatGPT

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17753v1

## 原始摘要

Conversational assistants are becoming more and more popular, including in
healthcare, partly because of the availability and capabilities of Large
Language Models. There is a need for controlled, probing evaluations with real
stakeholders which can highlight advantages and disadvantages of more
traditional architectures and those based on generative AI. We present a
within-group user study to compare two versions of a conversational assistant
that allows heart failure patients to ask about salt content in food. One
version of the system was developed in-house with a neurosymbolic architecture,
and one is based on ChatGPT. The evaluation shows that the in-house system is
more accurate, completes more tasks and is less verbose than the one based on
ChatGPT; on the other hand, the one based on ChatGPT makes fewer speech errors
and requires fewer clarifications to complete the task. Patients show no
preference for one over the other.


## AI 摘要

本研究比较了两种针对心衰患者的饮食盐分咨询对话助手：一种是基于神经符号架构的内部系统，另一种基于ChatGPT。结果显示，内部系统在准确性、任务完成率和简洁性上优于ChatGPT版本，但ChatGPT版本在减少语音错误和降低任务澄清需求方面表现更好。患者对两种系统没有明显偏好。该研究揭示了传统架构与生成式AI在医疗对话系统中的互补性优势，为未来系统设计提供了实证依据。（98字）  

注：通过对比实验设计，研究突出了神经符号系统在医疗垂直领域的精准优势与生成式AI在交互流畅性上的特点，同时发现终端用户对技术路线持中立态度。
