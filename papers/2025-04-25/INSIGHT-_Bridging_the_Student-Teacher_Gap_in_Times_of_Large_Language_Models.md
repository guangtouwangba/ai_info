# INSIGHT: Bridging the Student-Teacher Gap in Times of Large Language Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17677v1

## 原始摘要

The rise of AI, especially Large Language Models, presents challenges and
opportunities to integrate such technology into the classroom. AI has the
potential to revolutionize education by helping teaching staff with various
tasks, such as personalizing their teaching methods, but it also raises
concerns, for example, about the degradation of student-teacher interactions
and user privacy. This paper introduces INSIGHT, a proof of concept to combine
various AI tools to assist teaching staff and students in the process of
solving exercises. INSIGHT has a modular design that allows it to be integrated
into various higher education courses. We analyze students' questions to an LLM
by extracting keywords, which we use to dynamically build an FAQ from students'
questions and provide new insights for the teaching staff to use for more
personalized face-to-face support. Future work could build upon INSIGHT by
using the collected data to provide adaptive learning and adjust content based
on student progress and learning styles to offer a more interactive and
inclusive learning experience.


## AI 摘要

本文介绍了INSIGHT系统，这是一个结合多种AI工具辅助师生解题的模块化概念验证。该系统通过分析学生对大语言模型（LLM）的提问，提取关键词动态构建FAQ，并为教师提供个性化面授的参考依据。AI在教育领域既带来革新机遇（如个性化教学），也引发师生互动减少和隐私等担忧。INSIGHT的设计可适配多种高等教育课程，未来可通过收集数据实现自适应学习，根据学生进度和风格调整内容，提供更具互动性和包容性的学习体验。研究突显了AI赋能教育时需平衡技术创新与人文关怀的特点。
