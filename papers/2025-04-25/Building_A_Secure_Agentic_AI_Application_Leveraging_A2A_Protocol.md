# Building A Secure Agentic AI Application Leveraging A2A Protocol

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16902v1

## 原始摘要

As Agentic AI systems evolve from basic workflows to complex multi agent
collaboration, robust protocols such as Google's Agent2Agent (A2A) become
essential enablers. To foster secure adoption and ensure the reliability of
these complex interactions, understanding the secure implementation of A2A is
essential. This paper addresses this goal by providing a comprehensive security
analysis centered on the A2A protocol. We examine its fundamental elements and
operational dynamics, situating it within the framework of agent communication
development. Utilizing the MAESTRO framework, specifically designed for AI
risks, we apply proactive threat modeling to assess potential security issues
in A2A deployments, focusing on aspects such as Agent Card management, task
execution integrity, and authentication methodologies.
  Based on these insights, we recommend practical secure development
methodologies and architectural best practices designed to build resilient and
effective A2A systems. Our analysis also explores how the synergy between A2A
and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) can further enhance secure
interoperability. This paper equips developers and architects with the
knowledge and practical guidance needed to confidently leverage the A2A
protocol for building robust and secure next generation agentic applications.


## AI 摘要

随着AI代理系统从基础工作流发展为复杂的多代理协作，谷歌的Agent2Agent（A2A）等协议成为关键支撑。本文通过A2A协议的安全分析，探讨其核心要素和运行机制，并基于MAESTRO框架进行威胁建模，评估代理卡管理、任务执行完整性和认证方法等潜在风险。研究提出安全开发方法和架构实践，以增强A2A系统的可靠性，并分析A2A与模型上下文协议（MCP）的协同如何提升安全互操作性。为开发者构建安全、稳健的下一代代理应用提供实用指导。
