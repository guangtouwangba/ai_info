# A Measure Based Generalizable Approach to Understandability

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21615v2

## 原始摘要

Successful agent-human partnerships require that any agent generated
information is understandable to the human, and that the human can easily steer
the agent towards a goal. Such effective communication requires the agent to
develop a finer-level notion of what is understandable to the human.
State-of-the-art agents, including LLMs, lack this detailed notion of
understandability because they only capture average human sensibilities from
the training data, and therefore afford limited steerability (e.g., requiring
non-trivial prompt engineering).
  In this paper, instead of only relying on data, we argue for developing
generalizable, domain-agnostic measures of understandability that can be used
as directives for these agents. Existing research on understandability measures
is fragmented, we survey various such efforts across domains, and lay a
cognitive-science-rooted groundwork for more coherent and domain-agnostic
research investigations in future.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了智能体与人类有效合作的关键在于信息可理解性和人类对智能体的可控性。现有智能体（包括大语言模型）仅依赖训练数据中的平均人类感知，缺乏细粒度可理解性评估，导致可控性有限（如需要复杂提示工程）。作者主张开发通用、领域无关的可理解性度量标准作为智能体指导原则，而非仅依赖数据。通过跨领域调研现有碎片化研究，本文以认知科学为基础，为未来更系统、领域无关的可理解性研究奠定了基础，旨在提升人机协作的沟通效率。
