# RoboFactory: Exploring Embodied Agent Collaboration with Compositional Constraints

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16408v1

## 原始摘要

Designing effective embodied multi-agent systems is critical for solving
complex real-world tasks across domains. Due to the complexity of multi-agent
embodied systems, existing methods fail to automatically generate safe and
efficient training data for such systems. To this end, we propose the concept
of compositional constraints for embodied multi-agent systems, addressing the
challenges arising from collaboration among embodied agents. We design various
interfaces tailored to different types of constraints, enabling seamless
interaction with the physical world. Leveraging compositional constraints and
specifically designed interfaces, we develop an automated data collection
framework for embodied multi-agent systems and introduce the first benchmark
for embodied multi-agent manipulation, RoboFactory. Based on RoboFactory
benchmark, we adapt and evaluate the method of imitation learning and analyzed
its performance in different difficulty agent tasks. Furthermore, we explore
the architectures and training strategies for multi-agent imitation learning,
aiming to build safe and efficient embodied multi-agent systems.


## AI 摘要

设计有效的多智能体系统对于解决跨领域的复杂现实任务至关重要。由于多智能体系统的复杂性，现有方法难以自动生成安全高效的训练数据。为此，我们提出了组合约束的概念，以应对多智能体协作中的挑战，并设计了适应不同类型约束的接口，实现与物理世界的无缝交互。基于组合约束和定制接口，我们开发了自动化数据收集框架，并引入了首个多智能体操作基准RoboFactory。通过RoboFactory，我们评估了模仿学习方法在不同难度任务中的表现，并探索了多智能体模仿学习的架构和训练策略，旨在构建安全高效的多智能体系统。
