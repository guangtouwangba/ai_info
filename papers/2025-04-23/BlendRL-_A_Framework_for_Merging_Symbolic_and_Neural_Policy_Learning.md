# BlendRL: A Framework for Merging Symbolic and Neural Policy Learning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11689v2

## 原始摘要

Humans can leverage both symbolic reasoning and intuitive reactions. In
contrast, reinforcement learning policies are typically encoded in either
opaque systems like neural networks or symbolic systems that rely on predefined
symbols and rules. This disjointed approach severely limits the agents'
capabilities, as they often lack either the flexible low-level reaction
characteristic of neural agents or the interpretable reasoning of symbolic
agents. To overcome this challenge, we introduce BlendRL, a neuro-symbolic RL
framework that harmoniously integrates both paradigms within RL agents that use
mixtures of both logic and neural policies. We empirically demonstrate that
BlendRL agents outperform both neural and symbolic baselines in standard Atari
environments, and showcase their robustness to environmental changes.
Additionally, we analyze the interaction between neural and symbolic policies,
illustrating how their hybrid use helps agents overcome each other's
limitations.


## AI 摘要

本文介绍了BlendRL，一种结合神经与符号策略的强化学习框架。与人类同时具备符号推理和直觉反应不同，传统强化学习通常仅依赖神经网络（不透明）或符号系统（预定义规则），导致智能体缺乏灵活性或可解释性。BlendRL通过融合两种范式，使智能体兼具神经策略的快速反应能力和符号策略的可解释推理能力。实验表明，BlendRL在Atari游戏中表现优于纯神经或符号基线，且对环境变化更具鲁棒性。研究还揭示了神经与符号策略如何互补，共同克服单一方法的局限性。（100字）
