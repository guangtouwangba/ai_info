# BlendRL: A Framework for Merging Symbolic and Neural Policy Learning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11689v2

## 原始摘要

Humans can leverage both symbolic reasoning and intuitive reactions. In
contrast, reinforcement learning policies are typically encoded in either
opaque systems like neural networks or symbolic systems that rely on predefined
symbols and rules. This disjointed approach severely limits the agents'
capabilities, as they often lack either the flexible low-level reaction
characteristic of neural agents or the interpretable reasoning of symbolic
agents. To overcome this challenge, we introduce BlendRL, a neuro-symbolic RL
framework that harmoniously integrates both paradigms within RL agents that use
mixtures of both logic and neural policies. We empirically demonstrate that
BlendRL agents outperform both neural and symbolic baselines in standard Atari
environments, and showcase their robustness to environmental changes.
Additionally, we analyze the interaction between neural and symbolic policies,
illustrating how their hybrid use helps agents overcome each other's
limitations.


## AI 摘要

BlendRL是一种新型的神经符号强化学习框架，将神经网络与符号推理相结合，解决了传统RL智能体在灵活反应与可解释性之间的割裂问题。实验表明，BlendRL在Atari游戏中表现优于纯神经或纯符号基线，并展现出更强的环境适应能力。该框架通过混合使用逻辑策略和神经策略，使智能体能互相弥补不足：神经网络提供快速反应，符号系统确保可解释推理。研究还分析了两种策略的交互机制，证实其协同作用能有效突破单一方法的局限性，为构建更强大的RL智能体提供了新思路。（99字）
