# Honey, I Shrunk the Language Model: Impact of Knowledge Distillation Methods on Performance and Explainability

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16056v1

## 原始摘要

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has increasingly influenced modern society,
recently in particular through significant advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, high computational and storage demands of LLMs still
limit their deployment in resource-constrained environments. Knowledge
distillation addresses this challenge by training a small student model from a
larger teacher model. Previous research has introduced several distillation
methods for both generating training data and for training the student model.
Despite their relevance, the effects of state-of-the-art distillation methods
on model performance and explainability have not been thoroughly investigated
and compared. In this work, we enlarge the set of available methods by applying
critique-revision prompting to distillation for data generation and by
synthesizing existing methods for training. For these methods, we provide a
systematic comparison based on the widely used Commonsense Question-Answering
(CQA) dataset. While we measure performance via student model accuracy, we
employ a human-grounded study to evaluate explainability. We contribute new
distillation methods and their comparison in terms of both performance and
explainability. This should further advance the distillation of small language
models and, thus, contribute to broader applicability and faster diffusion of
LLM technology.


## AI 摘要

本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在资源受限环境中的部署挑战，提出了通过知识蒸馏训练小型学生模型的方法。研究扩展了现有蒸馏技术，采用批判性修订提示进行数据生成，并综合现有方法进行训练。基于常识问答（CQA）数据集，系统比较了不同方法在模型性能和可解释性上的表现。研究不仅测量了学生模型的准确性，还通过人工评估考察了可解释性。该工作为小型语言模型的蒸馏提供了新方法，并比较了其性能与可解释性，有助于推动LLM技术的更广泛应用和快速普及。
