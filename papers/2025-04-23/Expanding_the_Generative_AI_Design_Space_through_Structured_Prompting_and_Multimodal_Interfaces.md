# Expanding the Generative AI Design Space through Structured Prompting and Multimodal Interfaces

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14320v2

## 原始摘要

Text-based prompting remains the predominant interaction paradigm in
generative AI, yet it often introduces friction for novice users such as small
business owners (SBOs), who struggle to articulate creative goals in
domain-specific contexts like advertising. Through a formative study with six
SBOs in the United Kingdom, we identify three key challenges: difficulties in
expressing brand intuition through prompts, limited opportunities for
fine-grained adjustment and refinement during and after content generation, and
the frequent production of generic content that lacks brand specificity. In
response, we present ACAI (AI Co-Creation for Advertising and Inspiration), a
multimodal generative AI tool designed to support novice designers by moving
beyond traditional prompt interfaces. ACAI features a structured input system
composed of three panels: Branding, Audience and Goals, and the Inspiration
Board. These inputs allow users to convey brand-relevant context and visual
preferences. This work contributes to HCI research on generative systems by
showing how structured interfaces can foreground user-defined context, improve
alignment, and enhance co-creative control in novice creative workflows.


## AI 摘要

该研究指出，基于文本提示的传统生成式AI交互方式对新手用户（如小企业主）存在障碍，包括难以表达品牌直觉、缺乏细粒度调整机会及生成内容缺乏品牌特色。为此，研究者开发了多模态工具ACAI，通过结构化输入界面（品牌、受众与目标、灵感板）替代纯文本提示，帮助用户传递品牌背景与视觉偏好。研究表明，这种结构化界面能突出用户定义的情境，改善内容匹配度，并增强新手创作流程中的协同控制能力。研究基于对英国6位小企业主的形成性调研，为生成式系统的HCI研究提供了新见解。
