# Expanding the Generative AI Design Space through Structured Prompting and Multimodal Interfaces

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14320v2

## 原始摘要

Text-based prompting remains the predominant interaction paradigm in
generative AI, yet it often introduces friction for novice users such as small
business owners (SBOs), who struggle to articulate creative goals in
domain-specific contexts like advertising. Through a formative study with six
SBOs in the United Kingdom, we identify three key challenges: difficulties in
expressing brand intuition through prompts, limited opportunities for
fine-grained adjustment and refinement during and after content generation, and
the frequent production of generic content that lacks brand specificity. In
response, we present ACAI (AI Co-Creation for Advertising and Inspiration), a
multimodal generative AI tool designed to support novice designers by moving
beyond traditional prompt interfaces. ACAI features a structured input system
composed of three panels: Branding, Audience and Goals, and the Inspiration
Board. These inputs allow users to convey brand-relevant context and visual
preferences. This work contributes to HCI research on generative systems by
showing how structured interfaces can foreground user-defined context, improve
alignment, and enhance co-creative control in novice creative workflows.


## AI 摘要

该研究针对小型企业主（SBOs）在使用文本提示生成AI时遇到的困难，开发了多模态工具ACAI。通过英国6位SBO的调研发现主要问题包括：难以通过提示表达品牌直觉、缺乏细粒度调整机会、生成内容过于通用。ACAI采用结构化三面板输入（品牌、受众与目标、灵感板），替代传统文本提示，帮助用户传递品牌背景和视觉偏好。研究表明，结构化界面能突出用户定义的情境，改善对齐效果，增强新手创作流程中的协同控制能力，为生成式系统的HCI研究提供了新思路。（100字）
