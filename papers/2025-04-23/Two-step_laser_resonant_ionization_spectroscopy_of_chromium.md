**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16067v1

## 原始摘要

At TRIUMF's off-line laser ion source test stand, stepwise resonant laser
ionization spectroscopy of chromium (Cr) was carried out, to find an efficient
ionization scheme suitable for titanium sapphire (Ti:Sa) laser systems. With
three different first-excitation transitions, 357.971 nm, 359.451 nm, and
360.636 nm, automated continuous laser-frequency scans using a
frequency-doubled, grating-tuned Ti:Sa laser were performed. Rydberg series as
well as autoionizing(AI) states were observed. From these results, the
ionization potential (IP) of Cr was determined as
54575.49(2)$_\text{stat}$(2)$_\text{sys}$ cm$^{-1}$, which is one order of
magnitude more precise than the previously reported 54575.6(3) cm$^{-1}$ in
NIST database. The ionization scheme using the observed AI resonance, with
357.971 nm as the first step and 373.935 nm as the second step was subsequently
deployed to the online delivery of radioactive Cr isotope beams for precision
mass measurements. The online yields of $^{50-59}$Cr have been measured at
TRIUMF-ISAC.


## AI 摘要

在TRIUMF的离线激光离子源测试平台上，研究人员对铬(Cr)进行了逐步共振激光电离光谱研究，以寻找适合钛蓝宝石(Ti:Sa)激光系统的有效电离方案。通过使用357.971 nm、359.451 nm和360.636 nm三种不同的一阶激发跃迁，利用倍频光栅调谐Ti:Sa激光器进行自动连续激光频率扫描，观察到了里德堡系列和自电离(AI)态。由此确定Cr的电离势(IP)为54575.49(2)stat(2)sys cm-1，精度比NIST数据库提高了一个数量级。该方案随后被用于放射性Cr同位素束的在线输送，以进行精密质量测量。
