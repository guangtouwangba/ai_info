# Two-step laser resonant ionization spectroscopy of chromium

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16067v1

## 原始摘要

At TRIUMF's off-line laser ion source test stand, stepwise resonant laser
ionization spectroscopy of chromium (Cr) was carried out, to find an efficient
ionization scheme suitable for titanium sapphire (Ti:Sa) laser systems. With
three different first-excitation transitions, 357.971 nm, 359.451 nm, and
360.636 nm, automated continuous laser-frequency scans using a
frequency-doubled, grating-tuned Ti:Sa laser were performed. Rydberg series as
well as autoionizing(AI) states were observed. From these results, the
ionization potential (IP) of Cr was determined as
54575.49(2)$_\text{stat}$(2)$_\text{sys}$ cm$^{-1}$, which is one order of
magnitude more precise than the previously reported 54575.6(3) cm$^{-1}$ in
NIST database. The ionization scheme using the observed AI resonance, with
357.971 nm as the first step and 373.935 nm as the second step was subsequently
deployed to the online delivery of radioactive Cr isotope beams for precision
mass measurements. The online yields of $^{50-59}$Cr have been measured at
TRIUMF-ISAC.


## AI 摘要

在TRIUMF的离线和在线激光离子源实验中，研究人员通过三步共振激光电离光谱研究了铬(Cr)，找到了适用于钛宝石激光系统的高效电离方案。使用357.971 nm、359.451 nm和360.636 nm三种不同的一步激发波长进行自动频率扫描，观测到了里德堡系列和自电离态。测得铬的电离势为54575.49(2)stat(2)sys cm⁻¹，精度比NIST数据库提高了一个数量级。采用357.971 nm和373.935 nm的两步电离方案成功用于放射性Cr同位素束的在线产生，并测量了50-59Cr同位素的产额。
