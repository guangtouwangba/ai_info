# Values in the Wild: Discovering and Analyzing Values in Real-World Language Model Interactions

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15236v1

## 原始摘要

AI assistants can impart value judgments that shape people's decisions and
worldviews, yet little is known empirically about what values these systems
rely on in practice. To address this, we develop a bottom-up,
privacy-preserving method to extract the values (normative considerations
stated or demonstrated in model responses) that Claude 3 and 3.5 models exhibit
in hundreds of thousands of real-world interactions. We empirically discover
and taxonomize 3,307 AI values and study how they vary by context. We find that
Claude expresses many practical and epistemic values, and typically supports
prosocial human values while resisting values like "moral nihilism". While some
values appear consistently across contexts (e.g. "transparency"), many are more
specialized and context-dependent, reflecting the diversity of human
interlocutors and their varied contexts. For example, "harm prevention" emerges
when Claude resists users, "historical accuracy" when responding to queries
about controversial events, "healthy boundaries" when asked for relationship
advice, and "human agency" in technology ethics discussions. By providing the
first large-scale empirical mapping of AI values in deployment, our work
creates a foundation for more grounded evaluation and design of values in AI
systems.


## AI 摘要

本研究开发了一种自下而上、保护隐私的方法，通过分析Claude 3和3.5模型在数十万次真实互动中的表现，首次大规模实证提取了AI系统展现的价值观。研究发现，Claude表现出3,307种价值观，主要支持亲社会价值观，反对"道德虚无主义"等价值观。其价值观呈现多样性：既有跨情境一致的价值观（如"透明度"），也有情境依赖的专项价值观，如预防伤害、历史准确性、健康界限和人类能动性等。这项研究为AI系统价值观的评估和设计提供了实证基础，揭示了AI助手如何在实际应用中传递价值判断。
