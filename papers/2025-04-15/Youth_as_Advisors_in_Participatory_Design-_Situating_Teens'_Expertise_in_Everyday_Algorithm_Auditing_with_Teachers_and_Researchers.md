# Youth as Advisors in Participatory Design: Situating Teens' Expertise in Everyday Algorithm Auditing with Teachers and Researchers

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07202v2

## 原始摘要

Research on children and youth's participation in different roles in the
design of technologies is one of the core contributions in child-computer
interaction studies. Building on this work, we situate youth as advisors to a
group of high school computer science teacher- and researcher-designers
creating learning activities in the context of emerging technologies.
Specifically, we explore algorithm auditing as a potential entry point for
youth and adults to critically evaluate generative AI algorithmic systems, with
the goal of designing classroom lessons. Through a two-hour session where three
teenagers (16-18 years) served as advisors, we (1) examine the types of
expertise the teens shared and (2) identify back stage design elements that
fostered their agency and voice in this advisory role. Our discussion considers
opportunities and challenges in situating youth as advisors, providing
recommendations for actions that researchers, facilitators, and teachers can
take to make this unusual arrangement feasible and productive.


## AI 摘要

这项研究探讨了青少年作为顾问参与技术设计的过程，重点关注高中生与计算机科学教师及研究人员合作设计生成式AI算法审计课堂活动的案例。通过两小时的咨询会议，研究分析了三位16-18岁青少年分享的专业见解，并识别了促进其参与度和话语权的幕后设计要素。研究为将青少年定位为设计顾问提供了实践建议，既展示了这种非传统安排的潜力，也指出了实施过程中可能面临的挑战，为研究者、教师和协调者提供了可行性指导。
