# Youth as Advisors in Participatory Design: Situating Teens' Expertise in Everyday Algorithm Auditing with Teachers and Researchers

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07202v2

## 原始摘要

Research on children and youth's participation in different roles in the
design of technologies is one of the core contributions in child-computer
interaction studies. Building on this work, we situate youth as advisors to a
group of high school computer science teacher- and researcher-designers
creating learning activities in the context of emerging technologies.
Specifically, we explore algorithm auditing as a potential entry point for
youth and adults to critically evaluate generative AI algorithmic systems, with
the goal of designing classroom lessons. Through a two-hour session where three
teenagers (16-18 years) served as advisors, we (1) examine the types of
expertise the teens shared and (2) identify back stage design elements that
fostered their agency and voice in this advisory role. Our discussion considers
opportunities and challenges in situating youth as advisors, providing
recommendations for actions that researchers, facilitators, and teachers can
take to make this unusual arrangement feasible and productive.


## AI 摘要

本研究探讨了青少年作为顾问参与高中计算机科学教师和研究人员设计新兴技术学习活动的角色。通过两小时的研讨会，三名16-18岁青少年担任顾问，研究发现：(1)青少年分享了独特的专业知识；(2)幕后设计元素有效提升了他们在顾问角色中的自主权和发言权。研究分析了青少年担任顾问的机遇与挑战，为研究者、引导者和教师提供了可行性建议，以促进这种创新合作模式。该研究为儿童计算机交互领域提供了新视角，特别关注生成式AI算法审计作为批判性评估工具的潜力。
