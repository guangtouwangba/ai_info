# Detecting AI-Generated Text: Factors Influencing Detectability with Current Methods

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15583v2

## 原始摘要

Large language models (LLMs) have advanced to a point that even humans have
difficulty discerning whether a text was generated by another human, or by a
computer. However, knowing whether a text was produced by human or artificial
intelligence (AI) is important to determining its trustworthiness, and has
applications in many domains including detecting fraud and academic dishonesty,
as well as combating the spread of misinformation and political propaganda. The
task of AI-generated text (AIGT) detection is therefore both very challenging,
and highly critical. In this survey, we summarize state-of-the art approaches
to AIGT detection, including watermarking, statistical and stylistic analysis,
and machine learning classification. We also provide information about existing
datasets for this task. Synthesizing the research findings, we aim to provide
insight into the salient factors that combine to determine how "detectable"
AIGT text is under different scenarios, and to make practical recommendations
for future work towards this significant technical and societal challenge.


## AI 摘要

当前大语言模型生成的文本已难以与人类写作区分，这对判断内容可信度提出了挑战。AI生成文本检测在学术诚信、反欺诈和打击虚假信息等领域至关重要。本文综述了该领域最新技术，包括数字水印、统计风格分析和机器学习分类等方法，并整理了相关数据集。研究揭示了不同场景下AI文本的可检测性关键因素，为应对这一技术与社会双重挑战提供了实用建议。检测技术的发展需平衡准确性与实际应用需求，以应对日益复杂的AI生成内容识别问题。
