# Detecting AI-Generated Text: Factors Influencing Detectability with Current Methods

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15583v2

## 原始摘要

Large language models (LLMs) have advanced to a point that even humans have
difficulty discerning whether a text was generated by another human, or by a
computer. However, knowing whether a text was produced by human or artificial
intelligence (AI) is important to determining its trustworthiness, and has
applications in many domains including detecting fraud and academic dishonesty,
as well as combating the spread of misinformation and political propaganda. The
task of AI-generated text (AIGT) detection is therefore both very challenging,
and highly critical. In this survey, we summarize state-of-the art approaches
to AIGT detection, including watermarking, statistical and stylistic analysis,
and machine learning classification. We also provide information about existing
datasets for this task. Synthesizing the research findings, we aim to provide
insight into the salient factors that combine to determine how "detectable"
AIGT text is under different scenarios, and to make practical recommendations
for future work towards this significant technical and societal challenge.


## AI 摘要

当前，大型语言模型（LLM）生成的文本已接近人类水平，使AI生成文本（AIGT）的检测成为关键挑战，涉及学术诚信、虚假信息防范等领域。现有检测方法包括数字水印、统计与风格分析及机器学习分类。研究综述了最新技术，探讨了不同场景下AIGT的可检测性关键因素，并提供了相关数据集信息。未来工作需结合技术与社会需求，以应对这一重要挑战。
