# Detecting AI-Generated Text: Factors Influencing Detectability with Current Methods

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15583v2

## 原始摘要

Large language models (LLMs) have advanced to a point that even humans have
difficulty discerning whether a text was generated by another human, or by a
computer. However, knowing whether a text was produced by human or artificial
intelligence (AI) is important to determining its trustworthiness, and has
applications in many domains including detecting fraud and academic dishonesty,
as well as combating the spread of misinformation and political propaganda. The
task of AI-generated text (AIGT) detection is therefore both very challenging,
and highly critical. In this survey, we summarize state-of-the art approaches
to AIGT detection, including watermarking, statistical and stylistic analysis,
and machine learning classification. We also provide information about existing
datasets for this task. Synthesizing the research findings, we aim to provide
insight into the salient factors that combine to determine how "detectable"
AIGT text is under different scenarios, and to make practical recommendations
for future work towards this significant technical and societal challenge.


## AI 摘要

当前大语言模型(LLM)生成的文本已达到人类难辨真伪的程度，这使得AI生成文本(AIGT)检测成为关键挑战。该研究综述了AIGT检测的最新方法，包括数字水印、统计风格分析和机器学习分类等技术，并整理了相关数据集。研究分析了不同场景下影响文本可检测性的关键因素，旨在为应对这一重大技术与社会挑战提供实用建议，在学术诚信、虚假信息防范等领域具有重要意义。最后，论文为未来研究方向提出了建设性意见。
