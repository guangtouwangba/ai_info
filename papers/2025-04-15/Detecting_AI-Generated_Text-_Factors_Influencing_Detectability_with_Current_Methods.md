# Detecting AI-Generated Text: Factors Influencing Detectability with Current Methods

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15583v2

## 原始摘要

Large language models (LLMs) have advanced to a point that even humans have
difficulty discerning whether a text was generated by another human, or by a
computer. However, knowing whether a text was produced by human or artificial
intelligence (AI) is important to determining its trustworthiness, and has
applications in many domains including detecting fraud and academic dishonesty,
as well as combating the spread of misinformation and political propaganda. The
task of AI-generated text (AIGT) detection is therefore both very challenging,
and highly critical. In this survey, we summarize state-of-the art approaches
to AIGT detection, including watermarking, statistical and stylistic analysis,
and machine learning classification. We also provide information about existing
datasets for this task. Synthesizing the research findings, we aim to provide
insight into the salient factors that combine to determine how "detectable"
AIGT text is under different scenarios, and to make practical recommendations
for future work towards this significant technical and societal challenge.


## AI 摘要

当前大语言模型（LLM）生成的文本已难以被人类辨别真伪，但区分人工与AI生成文本（AIGT）对确保信息可信度至关重要，涉及学术诚信、反欺诈和打击虚假信息等领域。本文综述了AIGT检测的前沿方法，包括数字水印、统计与风格分析及机器学习分类，并汇总了相关数据集。研究揭示了不同场景下AIGT的可检测性关键因素，为应对这一技术与社会双重挑战提出了实用建议，推动未来研究发展。（100字）
