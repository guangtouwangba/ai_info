# A Survey of Large Language Model Empowered Agents for Recommendation and Search: Towards Next-Generation Information Retrieval

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05659v2

## 原始摘要

Information technology has profoundly altered the way humans interact with
information. The vast amount of content created, shared, and disseminated
online has made it increasingly difficult to access relevant information. Over
the past two decades, recommender systems and search (collectively referred to
as information retrieval systems) have evolved significantly to address these
challenges. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
capabilities that surpass human performance in various language-related tasks
and exhibit general understanding, reasoning, and decision-making abilities.
This paper explores the transformative potential of LLM agents in enhancing
recommender and search systems. We discuss the motivations and roles of LLM
agents, and establish a classification framework to elaborate on the existing
research. We highlight the immense potential of LLM agents in addressing
current challenges in recommendation and search, providing insights into future
research directions. This paper is the first to systematically review and
classify the research on LLM agents in these domains, offering a novel
perspective on leveraging this advanced AI technology for information
retrieval. To help understand the existing works, we list the existing papers
on LLM agent based recommendation and search at this link:

## AI 摘要

这篇论文探讨了大语言模型(LLM)代理在推荐系统和搜索引擎中的变革潜力。随着信息技术发展，海量在线内容使获取相关信息变得困难。近20年来，信息检索系统(推荐和搜索)已显著进化，而LLM在语言任务中展现出超越人类的表现，具备理解、推理和决策能力。研究首次系统综述并分类了LLM代理在这些领域的研究，建立了分类框架，阐述了现有成果，并指出LLM代理解决当前推荐和搜索挑战的巨大潜力，为未来研究方向提供见解。论文还汇总了相关研究论文列表供参考。
