# A Survey of Large Language Model Empowered Agents for Recommendation and Search: Towards Next-Generation Information Retrieval

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05659v2

## 原始摘要

Information technology has profoundly altered the way humans interact with
information. The vast amount of content created, shared, and disseminated
online has made it increasingly difficult to access relevant information. Over
the past two decades, recommender systems and search (collectively referred to
as information retrieval systems) have evolved significantly to address these
challenges. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
capabilities that surpass human performance in various language-related tasks
and exhibit general understanding, reasoning, and decision-making abilities.
This paper explores the transformative potential of LLM agents in enhancing
recommender and search systems. We discuss the motivations and roles of LLM
agents, and establish a classification framework to elaborate on the existing
research. We highlight the immense potential of LLM agents in addressing
current challenges in recommendation and search, providing insights into future
research directions. This paper is the first to systematically review and
classify the research on LLM agents in these domains, offering a novel
perspective on leveraging this advanced AI technology for information
retrieval. To help understand the existing works, we list the existing papers
on LLM agent based recommendation and search at this link:

## AI 摘要

信息技术的快速发展改变了人类获取信息的方式，但海量在线内容也带来了信息过载问题。近20年来，推荐系统和搜索引擎（统称信息检索系统）不断发展以应对这一挑战。最新的大型语言模型(LLMs)在语言任务上已超越人类表现，展现出理解、推理和决策能力。本文首次系统性地探讨了LLM代理如何革新推荐和搜索系统，建立了分类框架梳理现有研究，并指出其解决当前挑战的巨大潜力。研究为利用这一先进AI技术改进信息检索提供了新视角，相关论文列表可在GitHub链接获取。
