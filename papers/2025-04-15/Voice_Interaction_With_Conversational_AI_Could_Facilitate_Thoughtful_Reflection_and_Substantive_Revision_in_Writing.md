# Voice Interaction With Conversational AI Could Facilitate Thoughtful Reflection and Substantive Revision in Writing

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08687v1

## 原始摘要

Writing well requires not only expressing ideas but also refining them
through revision, a process facilitated by reflection. Prior research suggests
that feedback delivered through dialogues, such as those in writing center
tutoring sessions, can help writers reflect more thoughtfully on their work
compared to static feedback. Recent advancements in multi-modal large language
models (LLMs) now offer new possibilities for supporting interactive and
expressive voice-based reflection in writing. In particular, we propose that
LLM-generated static feedback can be repurposed as conversation starters,
allowing writers to seek clarification, request examples, and ask follow-up
questions, thereby fostering deeper reflection on their writing. We argue that
voice-based interaction can naturally facilitate this conversational exchange,
encouraging writers' engagement with higher-order concerns, facilitating
iterative refinement of their reflections, and reduce cognitive load compared
to text-based interactions. To investigate these effects, we propose a
formative study exploring how text vs. voice input influence writers'
reflection and subsequent revisions. Findings from this study will inform the
design of intelligent and interactive writing tools, offering insights into how
voice-based interactions with LLM-powered conversational agents can support
reflection and revision.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨如何利用多模态大语言模型(LLMs)通过语音交互促进写作反思。相比静态反馈，对话式反馈(如写作辅导)能引发更深层思考。研究者提出将LLM生成的静态反馈转化为对话起点，让作者通过语音互动提出追问、请求示例，从而降低认知负荷，促进对高阶写作问题的反思。研究计划比较文本与语音输入对写作反思和修改的影响，为开发智能交互式写作工具提供依据，探索语音交互如何通过LLM对话代理支持写作反思与修改过程。研究结果将指导更有效的写作辅助工具设计。
