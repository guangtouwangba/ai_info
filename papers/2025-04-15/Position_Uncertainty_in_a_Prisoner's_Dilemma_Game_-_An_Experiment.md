# Position Uncertainty in a Prisoner's Dilemma Game : An Experiment

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10441v1

## 原始摘要

Gallice and Monzon (2019) present a natural environment that sustains full
cooperation in one-shot social dilemmas among a finite number of
self-interested agents. They demonstrate that in a sequential public goods
game, where agents lack knowledge of their position in the sequence but can
observe some predecessors' actions, full contribution emerges in equilibrium
due to agents' incentive to induce potential successors to follow suit.
Furthermore, they show that this principle extends to a number of social
dilemmas, with the prominent example that of the prisoner's dilemma. In this
study, we experimentally test the theoretical predictions of this model in a
multi- player prisoner's dilemma environment, where subjects are not aware of
their position in the sequence and receive only partial information on past
cooperating actions. We test the predictions of the model, and through rigorous
structural econometric analysis, we test the descriptive capacity of the model
against alternative behavioural strategies, such as conditional cooperation,
altruistic play and free-riding behaviour. We find that the majority resorts to
free-riding behaviour, around 30% is classified as Gallice and Monzon (2019)
types, followed by those with social preference considerations and the
unconditional altruists.


## AI 摘要

Gallice和Monzon(2019)提出，在有限自利代理人的一次性社会困境中，当代理人不知晓自身在序列中的位置但能观察部分前人行为时，序贯公共品博弈会实现完全合作均衡。本研究通过多人囚徒困境实验验证该理论，被试不知序列位置且仅获知部分历史合作信息。实验结果显示：多数人选择搭便车(约30%符合原理论预测)，其次是考虑社会偏好的群体和无条件利他者。研究通过计量分析对比了条件合作、利他行为等替代策略，发现原模型解释力有限，多数人仍倾向于非合作行为。
