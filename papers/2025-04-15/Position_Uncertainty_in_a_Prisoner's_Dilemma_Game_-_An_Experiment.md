# Position Uncertainty in a Prisoner's Dilemma Game : An Experiment

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10441v1

## 原始摘要

Gallice and Monzon (2019) present a natural environment that sustains full
cooperation in one-shot social dilemmas among a finite number of
self-interested agents. They demonstrate that in a sequential public goods
game, where agents lack knowledge of their position in the sequence but can
observe some predecessors' actions, full contribution emerges in equilibrium
due to agents' incentive to induce potential successors to follow suit.
Furthermore, they show that this principle extends to a number of social
dilemmas, with the prominent example that of the prisoner's dilemma. In this
study, we experimentally test the theoretical predictions of this model in a
multi- player prisoner's dilemma environment, where subjects are not aware of
their position in the sequence and receive only partial information on past
cooperating actions. We test the predictions of the model, and through rigorous
structural econometric analysis, we test the descriptive capacity of the model
against alternative behavioural strategies, such as conditional cooperation,
altruistic play and free-riding behaviour. We find that the majority resorts to
free-riding behaviour, around 30% is classified as Gallice and Monzon (2019)
types, followed by those with social preference considerations and the
unconditional altruists.


## AI 摘要

Gallice和Monzon（2019）提出了一种在有限自利主体的一次性社会困境中维持完全合作的自然环境。他们证明，在顺序公共品博弈中，当主体不知道自身顺序位置但能观察到部分前人行为时，完全贡献会成为均衡结果，因为主体有激励诱导后续者效仿。这一原则也适用于囚徒困境等社会困境。本研究通过多人囚徒困境实验检验该模型预测，发现多数人选择搭便车，约30%符合Gallice和Monzon类型，其余为具有社会偏好或无条件利他的主体。结构计量分析表明该模型的解释力优于其他行为策略。
