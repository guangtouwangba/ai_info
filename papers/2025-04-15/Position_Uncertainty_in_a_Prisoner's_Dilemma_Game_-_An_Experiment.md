# Position Uncertainty in a Prisoner's Dilemma Game : An Experiment

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10441v1

## 原始摘要

Gallice and Monzon (2019) present a natural environment that sustains full
cooperation in one-shot social dilemmas among a finite number of
self-interested agents. They demonstrate that in a sequential public goods
game, where agents lack knowledge of their position in the sequence but can
observe some predecessors' actions, full contribution emerges in equilibrium
due to agents' incentive to induce potential successors to follow suit.
Furthermore, they show that this principle extends to a number of social
dilemmas, with the prominent example that of the prisoner's dilemma. In this
study, we experimentally test the theoretical predictions of this model in a
multi- player prisoner's dilemma environment, where subjects are not aware of
their position in the sequence and receive only partial information on past
cooperating actions. We test the predictions of the model, and through rigorous
structural econometric analysis, we test the descriptive capacity of the model
against alternative behavioural strategies, such as conditional cooperation,
altruistic play and free-riding behaviour. We find that the majority resorts to
free-riding behaviour, around 30% is classified as Gallice and Monzon (2019)
types, followed by those with social preference considerations and the
unconditional altruists.


## AI 摘要

Gallice和Monzon（2019）提出了一种自然情境，能在一次性社会困境中促使有限数量的自利个体实现完全合作。他们证明，在顺序公共品博弈中，当参与者不知道自己的顺序位置但能观察到部分前序行动时，出于激励后续者效仿的动机，完全贡献会成为均衡结果。这一原理也适用于囚徒困境等社会困境。本研究通过实验在多玩家囚徒困境中检验该理论预测，发现多数人选择搭便车，约30%符合Gallice和Monzon模型，其余表现为社会偏好或无条件利他行为。结构计量分析验证了模型对替代行为策略的解释力。
