# Position Uncertainty in a Prisoner's Dilemma Game : An Experiment

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10441v1

## 原始摘要

Gallice and Monzon (2019) present a natural environment that sustains full
cooperation in one-shot social dilemmas among a finite number of
self-interested agents. They demonstrate that in a sequential public goods
game, where agents lack knowledge of their position in the sequence but can
observe some predecessors' actions, full contribution emerges in equilibrium
due to agents' incentive to induce potential successors to follow suit.
Furthermore, they show that this principle extends to a number of social
dilemmas, with the prominent example that of the prisoner's dilemma. In this
study, we experimentally test the theoretical predictions of this model in a
multi- player prisoner's dilemma environment, where subjects are not aware of
their position in the sequence and receive only partial information on past
cooperating actions. We test the predictions of the model, and through rigorous
structural econometric analysis, we test the descriptive capacity of the model
against alternative behavioural strategies, such as conditional cooperation,
altruistic play and free-riding behaviour. We find that the majority resorts to
free-riding behaviour, around 30% is classified as Gallice and Monzon (2019)
types, followed by those with social preference considerations and the
unconditional altruists.


## AI 摘要

Gallice和Monzon（2019）提出了一种自然情境，能使有限数量自利主体在一次性的社会困境中实现完全合作。他们证明，在序贯公共品博弈中，当主体无法获知自身顺序位置但能观察到部分前序行动时，为引导后续者效仿，主体会形成完全贡献的均衡。该理论还适用于囚徒困境等社会困境。本研究通过多人囚徒困境实验（被试不知顺序且仅获知部分历史合作信息），检验该模型预测。计量分析显示：多数人选择搭便车（约30%符合原模型预测），其余为条件合作者、社会偏好者及无条件利他主义者。
