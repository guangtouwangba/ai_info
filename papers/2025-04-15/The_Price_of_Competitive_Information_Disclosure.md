# The Price of Competitive Information Disclosure

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10459v1

## 原始摘要

In many decision-making scenarios, individuals strategically choose what
information to disclose to optimize their own outcomes. It is unclear whether
such strategic information disclosure can lead to good societal outcomes. To
address this question, we consider a competitive Bayesian persuasion model in
which multiple agents selectively disclose information about their qualities to
a principal, who aims to choose the candidates with the highest qualities.
Using the price-of-anarchy framework, we quantify the inefficiency of such
strategic disclosure. We show that the price of anarchy is at most a constant
when the agents have independent quality distributions, even if their utility
functions are heterogeneous. This result provides the first theoretical
guarantee on the limits of inefficiency in Bayesian persuasion with competitive
information disclosure.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了竞争性贝叶斯劝说模型中代理人策略性信息披露对社会效率的影响。研究发现，即使代理人效用函数各异，当其质量分布独立时，信息无政府状态的代价（price of anarchy）仍保持恒定。这首次为竞争性信息披露下的贝叶斯劝说效率损失提供了理论保证，表明策略性信息筛选在特定条件下仍可实现较优的社会结果。研究通过量化分析，验证了在多代理竞争场景中，委托人仍能有效筛选出高质量候选人的可能性。
