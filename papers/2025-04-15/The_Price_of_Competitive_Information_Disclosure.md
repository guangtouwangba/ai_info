# The Price of Competitive Information Disclosure

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10459v1

## 原始摘要

In many decision-making scenarios, individuals strategically choose what
information to disclose to optimize their own outcomes. It is unclear whether
such strategic information disclosure can lead to good societal outcomes. To
address this question, we consider a competitive Bayesian persuasion model in
which multiple agents selectively disclose information about their qualities to
a principal, who aims to choose the candidates with the highest qualities.
Using the price-of-anarchy framework, we quantify the inefficiency of such
strategic disclosure. We show that the price of anarchy is at most a constant
when the agents have independent quality distributions, even if their utility
functions are heterogeneous. This result provides the first theoretical
guarantee on the limits of inefficiency in Bayesian persuasion with competitive
information disclosure.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了竞争性贝叶斯劝说模型中信息选择性披露对社会效率的影响。多个代理人策略性地披露自身质量信息，而委托人希望选择最高质量的候选人。研究表明，当代理人质量分布独立时，即使效用函数不同，无效率的价格（price of anarchy）也保持恒定。这首次为竞争性信息披露场景下的贝叶斯劝说效率损失提供了理论保证，表明策略性信息筛选仍能维持较好的社会结果。
