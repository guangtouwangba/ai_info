# COBRA: Contextual Bandit Algorithm for Ensuring Truthful Strategic Agents

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23720v1

## 原始摘要

This paper considers a contextual bandit problem involving multiple agents,
where a learner sequentially observes the contexts and the agent's reported
arms, and then selects the arm that maximizes the system's overall reward.
Existing work in contextual bandits assumes that agents truthfully report their
arms, which is unrealistic in many real-life applications. For instance,
consider an online platform with multiple sellers; some sellers may
misrepresent product quality to gain an advantage, such as having the platform
preferentially recommend their products to online users. To address this
challenge, we propose an algorithm, COBRA, for contextual bandit problems
involving strategic agents that disincentivize their strategic behavior without
using any monetary incentives, while having incentive compatibility and a
sub-linear regret guarantee. Our experimental results also validate the
different performance aspects of our proposed algorithm.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种针对多智能体情境下的上下文赌博机问题的新算法COBRA。传统方法假设智能体会如实报告其选择，但现实中（如电商平台）可能存在策略性虚假报告行为。COBRA算法无需货币激励即可抑制智能体的策略性行为，同时保证激励相容性和次线性遗憾界。实验验证了该算法的各项性能优势。该研究解决了实际应用中智能体可能虚报信息的关键问题，为平台推荐系统等场景提供了更可靠的解决方案。
