# COBRA: Contextual Bandit Algorithm for Ensuring Truthful Strategic Agents

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23720v1

## 原始摘要

This paper considers a contextual bandit problem involving multiple agents,
where a learner sequentially observes the contexts and the agent's reported
arms, and then selects the arm that maximizes the system's overall reward.
Existing work in contextual bandits assumes that agents truthfully report their
arms, which is unrealistic in many real-life applications. For instance,
consider an online platform with multiple sellers; some sellers may
misrepresent product quality to gain an advantage, such as having the platform
preferentially recommend their products to online users. To address this
challenge, we propose an algorithm, COBRA, for contextual bandit problems
involving strategic agents that disincentivize their strategic behavior without
using any monetary incentives, while having incentive compatibility and a
sub-linear regret guarantee. Our experimental results also validate the
different performance aspects of our proposed algorithm.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种名为COBRA的算法，用于解决涉及策略性代理的情境赌博问题。传统方法假设代理会如实报告其选择，但在实际应用中（如在线平台卖家可能虚报产品质量），这一假设并不成立。COBRA算法无需货币激励即可抑制代理的策略性行为，同时保证激励兼容性和次线性遗憾界。实验验证了该算法的各项性能表现。
