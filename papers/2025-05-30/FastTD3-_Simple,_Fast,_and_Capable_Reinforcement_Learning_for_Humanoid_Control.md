# FastTD3: Simple, Fast, and Capable Reinforcement Learning for Humanoid Control

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22642v2

## 原始摘要

Reinforcement learning (RL) has driven significant progress in robotics, but
its complexity and long training times remain major bottlenecks. In this
report, we introduce FastTD3, a simple, fast, and capable RL algorithm that
significantly speeds up training for humanoid robots in popular suites such as
HumanoidBench, IsaacLab, and MuJoCo Playground. Our recipe is remarkably
simple: we train an off-policy TD3 agent with several modifications -- parallel
simulation, large-batch updates, a distributional critic, and carefully tuned
hyperparameters. FastTD3 solves a range of HumanoidBench tasks in under 3 hours
on a single A100 GPU, while remaining stable during training. We also provide a
lightweight and easy-to-use implementation of FastTD3 to accelerate RL research
in robotics.


## AI 摘要

这篇报告介绍了FastTD3算法，一种简单高效的强化学习方法，可大幅缩短人形机器人在HumanoidBench等平台的训练时间。该方法基于TD3算法进行改进，通过并行模拟、大批量更新、分布化评价网络和精细调参等技术，仅需3小时（单块A100 GPU）即可完成多项HumanoidBench任务，且训练过程稳定。研究团队还提供了轻量级开源实现，以促进机器人领域的强化学习研究。
