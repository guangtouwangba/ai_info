# From Chat Logs to Collective Insights: Aggregative Question Answering

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23765v1

## 原始摘要

Conversational agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are rapidly
becoming integral to our daily interactions, generating unprecedented amounts
of conversational data. Such datasets offer a powerful lens into societal
interests, trending topics, and collective concerns. Yet, existing approaches
typically treat these interactions as independent and miss critical insights
that could emerge from aggregating and reasoning across large-scale
conversation logs. In this paper, we introduce Aggregative Question Answering,
a novel task requiring models to reason explicitly over thousands of
user-chatbot interactions to answer aggregative queries, such as identifying
emerging concerns among specific demographics. To enable research in this
direction, we construct a benchmark, WildChat-AQA, comprising 6,027 aggregative
questions derived from 182,330 real-world chatbot conversations. Experiments
show that existing methods either struggle to reason effectively or incur
prohibitive computational costs, underscoring the need for new approaches
capable of extracting collective insights from large-scale conversational data.


## AI 摘要

大型语言模型（LLM）驱动的对话代理正成为日常交互的重要部分，产生海量对话数据。这些数据能反映社会兴趣、热点话题和集体关切，但现有方法通常将对话视为独立事件，忽略了通过聚合和分析大规模对话日志可能获得的关键洞察。为此，研究者提出“聚合问答”任务，要求模型基于数千条用户-聊天机器人交互进行推理，回答聚合性问题（如识别特定人群的新关切）。他们构建了WildChat-AQA基准，包含6,027个聚合问题，源自182,330条真实对话。实验表明，现有方法推理能力不足或计算成本过高，亟需新方法从大规模对话数据中提取集体洞察。
