# From Chat Logs to Collective Insights: Aggregative Question Answering

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23765v1

## 原始摘要

Conversational agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are rapidly
becoming integral to our daily interactions, generating unprecedented amounts
of conversational data. Such datasets offer a powerful lens into societal
interests, trending topics, and collective concerns. Yet, existing approaches
typically treat these interactions as independent and miss critical insights
that could emerge from aggregating and reasoning across large-scale
conversation logs. In this paper, we introduce Aggregative Question Answering,
a novel task requiring models to reason explicitly over thousands of
user-chatbot interactions to answer aggregative queries, such as identifying
emerging concerns among specific demographics. To enable research in this
direction, we construct a benchmark, WildChat-AQA, comprising 6,027 aggregative
questions derived from 182,330 real-world chatbot conversations. Experiments
show that existing methods either struggle to reason effectively or incur
prohibitive computational costs, underscoring the need for new approaches
capable of extracting collective insights from large-scale conversational data.


## AI 摘要

大型语言模型(LLM)驱动的对话代理日益普及，产生了海量对话数据。这些数据能揭示社会兴趣、热点话题和公共关切，但现有方法通常将对话视为独立事件，错失了从大规模对话日志中聚合推理的机会。为此，研究者提出了聚合问答(AQA)新任务，要求模型基于数千条用户-聊天机器人交互进行显式推理，以回答聚合查询(如识别特定人群的新关切)。研究团队构建了WildChat-AQA基准测试，包含源自182,330条真实对话的6,027个聚合问题。实验表明，现有方法在有效推理或计算成本方面存在不足，亟需新方法从大规模对话数据中提取集体洞见。
