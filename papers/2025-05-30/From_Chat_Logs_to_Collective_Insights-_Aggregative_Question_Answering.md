# From Chat Logs to Collective Insights: Aggregative Question Answering

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23765v1

## 原始摘要

Conversational agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are rapidly
becoming integral to our daily interactions, generating unprecedented amounts
of conversational data. Such datasets offer a powerful lens into societal
interests, trending topics, and collective concerns. Yet, existing approaches
typically treat these interactions as independent and miss critical insights
that could emerge from aggregating and reasoning across large-scale
conversation logs. In this paper, we introduce Aggregative Question Answering,
a novel task requiring models to reason explicitly over thousands of
user-chatbot interactions to answer aggregative queries, such as identifying
emerging concerns among specific demographics. To enable research in this
direction, we construct a benchmark, WildChat-AQA, comprising 6,027 aggregative
questions derived from 182,330 real-world chatbot conversations. Experiments
show that existing methods either struggle to reason effectively or incur
prohibitive computational costs, underscoring the need for new approaches
capable of extracting collective insights from large-scale conversational data.


## AI 摘要

大型语言模型驱动的对话助手日益普及，产生了海量对话数据，为分析社会兴趣和群体关切提供了新视角。现有方法通常孤立处理对话，忽视了跨对话聚合推理的价值。为此，研究者提出"聚合问答"新任务，要求模型通过分析数千条用户-聊天机器人对话来回答汇总性问题（如识别特定人群的新兴关切）。基于182,330条真实对话构建的WildChat-AQA基准测试（含6,027个聚合问题）显示，现有方法存在推理能力不足或计算成本过高的问题，亟需开发能有效提取群体洞见的新技术。
