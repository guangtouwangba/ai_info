# From Chat Logs to Collective Insights: Aggregative Question Answering

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23765v1

## 原始摘要

Conversational agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are rapidly
becoming integral to our daily interactions, generating unprecedented amounts
of conversational data. Such datasets offer a powerful lens into societal
interests, trending topics, and collective concerns. Yet, existing approaches
typically treat these interactions as independent and miss critical insights
that could emerge from aggregating and reasoning across large-scale
conversation logs. In this paper, we introduce Aggregative Question Answering,
a novel task requiring models to reason explicitly over thousands of
user-chatbot interactions to answer aggregative queries, such as identifying
emerging concerns among specific demographics. To enable research in this
direction, we construct a benchmark, WildChat-AQA, comprising 6,027 aggregative
questions derived from 182,330 real-world chatbot conversations. Experiments
show that existing methods either struggle to reason effectively or incur
prohibitive computational costs, underscoring the need for new approaches
capable of extracting collective insights from large-scale conversational data.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种新型任务——聚合问答（Aggregative Question Answering），旨在通过分析大规模用户与聊天机器人的对话数据（如18.2万条真实对话），从中提取群体性洞察（如特定人群的关注点）。研究构建了包含6,027个聚合问题的WildChat-AQA基准测试，发现现有方法要么推理能力不足，要么计算成本过高。该任务突破了传统独立对话分析的限制，为从海量会话数据中发现社会趋势、集体关切提供了新思路，凸显了开发新型分析方法的必要性。
