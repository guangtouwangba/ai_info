# Exploring Flow-Lenia Universes with a Curiosity-driven AI Scientist: Discovering Diverse Ecosystem Dynamics

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15998v2

## 原始摘要

We present a method for the automated discovery of system-level dynamics in
Flow-Lenia--a continuous cellular automaton (CA) with mass conservation and
parameter localization-using a curiosity--driven AI scientist. This method aims
to uncover processes leading to self-organization of evolutionary and
ecosystemic dynamics in CAs. We build on previous work which uses diversity
search algorithms in Lenia to find self-organized individual patterns, and
extend it to large environments that support distinct interacting patterns. We
adapt Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Processes (IMGEPs) to drive
exploration of diverse Flow-Lenia environments using simulation-wide metrics,
such as evolutionary activity, compression-based complexity, and multi-scale
entropy. We test our method in two experiments, showcasing its ability to
illuminate significantly more diverse dynamics compared to random search. We
show qualitative results illustrating how ecosystemic simulations enable
self-organization of complex collective behaviors not captured by previous
individual pattern search and analysis. We complement automated discovery with
an interactive exploration tool, creating an effective human-AI collaborative
workflow for scientific investigation. Though demonstrated specifically with
Flow-Lenia, this methodology provides a framework potentially applicable to
other parameterizable complex systems where understanding emergent collective
properties is of interest.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种利用好奇心驱动的AI科学家自动发现Flow-Lenia（一种具有质量守恒和参数定位特性的连续细胞自动机）系统级动力学的方法。该方法通过多样性搜索算法和内在动机目标探索过程(IMGEPs)，在大型环境中发现自组织的交互模式。实验表明，相比随机搜索，该方法能揭示更丰富的动力学行为，包括传统个体模式搜索无法捕捉的复杂集体行为。研究还开发了交互式探索工具，建立了人机协作的科学工作流程。虽然以Flow-Lenia为例，但该方法可推广至其他参数化复杂系统，用于研究涌现的集体特性。
