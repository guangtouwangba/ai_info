# When LLMs Play the Telephone Game: Cultural Attractors as Conceptual Tools to Evaluate LLMs in Multi-turn Settings

## 原始摘要

As large language models (LLMs) start interacting with each other and
generating an increasing amount of text online, it becomes crucial to better
understand how information is transformed as it passes from one LLM to the
next. While significant research has examined individual LLM behaviors,
existing studies have largely overlooked the collective behaviors and
information distortions arising from iterated LLM interactions. Small biases,
negligible at the single output level, risk being amplified in iterated
interactions, potentially leading the content to evolve towards attractor
states. In a series of telephone game experiments, we apply a transmission
chain design borrowed from the human cultural evolution literature: LLM agents
iteratively receive, produce, and transmit texts from the previous to the next
agent in the chain. By tracking the evolution of text toxicity, positivity,
difficulty, and length across transmission chains, we uncover the existence of
biases and attractors, and study their dependence on the initial text, the
instructions, language model, and model size. For instance, we find that more
open-ended instructions lead to stronger attraction effects compared to more
constrained tasks. We also find that different text properties display
different sensitivity to attraction effects, with toxicity leading to stronger
attractors than length. These findings highlight the importance of accounting
for multi-step transmission dynamics and represent a first step towards a more
comprehensive understanding of LLM cultural dynamics.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）在多轮交互中信息传递的演变。通过电话游戏实验设计，研究者发现LLM在迭代传递文本时会产生偏差放大效应，使内容趋向特定"吸引态"。实验追踪了文本毒性、积极性、难度和长度等属性的变化，发现开放性指令会强化吸引效应，且不同属性对吸引效应的敏感度不同（如毒性比长度更易受影响）。研究揭示了LLM多步传递动态的重要性，为理解LLM文化动态迈出了第一步。这些发现对理解网络环境中AI生成内容的演变具有重要启示。
