# When LLMs Play the Telephone Game: Cultural Attractors as Conceptual Tools to Evaluate LLMs in Multi-turn Settings

## 原始摘要

As large language models (LLMs) start interacting with each other and
generating an increasing amount of text online, it becomes crucial to better
understand how information is transformed as it passes from one LLM to the
next. While significant research has examined individual LLM behaviors,
existing studies have largely overlooked the collective behaviors and
information distortions arising from iterated LLM interactions. Small biases,
negligible at the single output level, risk being amplified in iterated
interactions, potentially leading the content to evolve towards attractor
states. In a series of telephone game experiments, we apply a transmission
chain design borrowed from the human cultural evolution literature: LLM agents
iteratively receive, produce, and transmit texts from the previous to the next
agent in the chain. By tracking the evolution of text toxicity, positivity,
difficulty, and length across transmission chains, we uncover the existence of
biases and attractors, and study their dependence on the initial text, the
instructions, language model, and model size. For instance, we find that more
open-ended instructions lead to stronger attraction effects compared to more
constrained tasks. We also find that different text properties display
different sensitivity to attraction effects, with toxicity leading to stronger
attractors than length. These findings highlight the importance of accounting
for multi-step transmission dynamics and represent a first step towards a more
comprehensive understanding of LLM cultural dynamics.

该研究探讨了大语言模型（LLM）在迭代交互中的信息传递偏差与吸引子效应。通过"传话游戏"实验设计，研究者追踪文本在LLM链式传递过程中毒性、积极性、难度和长度的演变。研究发现：开放式指令比约束性任务更容易产生吸引子效应；不同文本属性对吸引效应敏感度不同（如毒性比长度更易形成强吸引子）。这些发现揭示了LLM多步传递中的动态演变规律，表明单个LLM输出中微小的偏差可能在迭代中被放大，最终导致内容向特定状态演化。研究为理解LLM文化动态提供了重要基础。
