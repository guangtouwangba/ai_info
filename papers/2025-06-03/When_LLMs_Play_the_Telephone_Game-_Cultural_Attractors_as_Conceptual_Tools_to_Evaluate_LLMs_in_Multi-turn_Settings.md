# When LLMs Play the Telephone Game: Cultural Attractors as Conceptual Tools to Evaluate LLMs in Multi-turn Settings

## 原始摘要

As large language models (LLMs) start interacting with each other and
generating an increasing amount of text online, it becomes crucial to better
understand how information is transformed as it passes from one LLM to the
next. While significant research has examined individual LLM behaviors,
existing studies have largely overlooked the collective behaviors and
information distortions arising from iterated LLM interactions. Small biases,
negligible at the single output level, risk being amplified in iterated
interactions, potentially leading the content to evolve towards attractor
states. In a series of telephone game experiments, we apply a transmission
chain design borrowed from the human cultural evolution literature: LLM agents
iteratively receive, produce, and transmit texts from the previous to the next
agent in the chain. By tracking the evolution of text toxicity, positivity,
difficulty, and length across transmission chains, we uncover the existence of
biases and attractors, and study their dependence on the initial text, the
instructions, language model, and model size. For instance, we find that more
open-ended instructions lead to stronger attraction effects compared to more
constrained tasks. We also find that different text properties display
different sensitivity to attraction effects, with toxicity leading to stronger
attractors than length. These findings highlight the importance of accounting
for multi-step transmission dynamics and represent a first step towards a more
comprehensive understanding of LLM cultural dynamics.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）在迭代交互中的信息传递偏差与吸引子效应。通过"电话游戏"实验设计，研究者发现：1）单次输出中微小的偏差会在多次传递中被放大，导致内容向特定吸引态演化；2）开放性指令比约束性任务产生更强的吸引效应；3）不同文本属性（如毒性、长度）对吸引效应的敏感度不同，毒性比长度更易形成强吸引子。研究揭示了多步传递动态的重要性，为理解LLM文化演化机制提供了初步基础，强调需关注模型规模、初始文本等因素对集体行为的影响。（99字）
