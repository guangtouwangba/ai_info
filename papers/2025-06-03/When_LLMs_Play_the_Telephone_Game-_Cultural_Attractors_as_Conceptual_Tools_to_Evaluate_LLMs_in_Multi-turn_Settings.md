# When LLMs Play the Telephone Game: Cultural Attractors as Conceptual Tools to Evaluate LLMs in Multi-turn Settings

## 原始摘要

As large language models (LLMs) start interacting with each other and
generating an increasing amount of text online, it becomes crucial to better
understand how information is transformed as it passes from one LLM to the
next. While significant research has examined individual LLM behaviors,
existing studies have largely overlooked the collective behaviors and
information distortions arising from iterated LLM interactions. Small biases,
negligible at the single output level, risk being amplified in iterated
interactions, potentially leading the content to evolve towards attractor
states. In a series of telephone game experiments, we apply a transmission
chain design borrowed from the human cultural evolution literature: LLM agents
iteratively receive, produce, and transmit texts from the previous to the next
agent in the chain. By tracking the evolution of text toxicity, positivity,
difficulty, and length across transmission chains, we uncover the existence of
biases and attractors, and study their dependence on the initial text, the
instructions, language model, and model size. For instance, we find that more
open-ended instructions lead to stronger attraction effects compared to more
constrained tasks. We also find that different text properties display
different sensitivity to attraction effects, with toxicity leading to stronger
attractors than length. These findings highlight the importance of accounting
for multi-step transmission dynamics and represent a first step towards a more
comprehensive understanding of LLM cultural dynamics.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）在多轮交互中的信息传递偏差与演化规律。通过"传话游戏"实验设计，研究者发现LLM在迭代传递文本时，微小的初始偏差会被放大，导致内容逐渐趋近于特定"吸引态"。实验追踪了文本毒性、积极性、难度和长度等属性的变化，发现开放性指令会强化吸引效应，且不同属性敏感性不同（如毒性比长度更易形成吸引态）。研究揭示了多步传递动态的重要性，为理解LLM文化演化机制提供了初步基础。
