# Ask in Any Modality: A Comprehensive Survey on Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08826v3

## 原始摘要

Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from hallucinations and outdated
knowledge due to their reliance on static training data. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by integrating external dynamic
information for improved factual grounding. With advances in multimodal
learning, Multimodal RAG extends this approach by incorporating multiple
modalities such as text, images, audio, and video to enhance the generated
outputs. However, cross-modal alignment and reasoning introduce unique
challenges beyond those in unimodal RAG. This survey offers a structured and
comprehensive analysis of Multimodal RAG systems, covering datasets,
benchmarks, metrics, evaluation, methodologies, and innovations in retrieval,
fusion, augmentation, and generation. We review training strategies, robustness
enhancements, loss functions, and agent-based approaches, while also exploring
the diverse Multimodal RAG scenarios. In addition, we outline open challenges
and future directions to guide research in this evolving field. This survey
lays the foundation for developing more capable and reliable AI systems that
effectively leverage multimodal dynamic external knowledge bases. All resources

## AI 摘要

大语言模型(LLMs)依赖静态训练数据，存在幻觉和知识过时问题。检索增强生成(RAG)通过整合外部动态信息改善事实依据。随着多模态学习的发展，多模态RAG进一步整合文本、图像、音频和视频等多种模态来增强输出效果，但跨模态对齐和推理带来了新挑战。本文综述系统分析了多模态RAG的数据集、基准、评估指标、方法及检索/融合/增强/生成等创新技术，涵盖训练策略、鲁棒性增强、损失函数和基于代理的方法，并探讨了多样化应用场景。最后指出开放挑战和未来方向，为开发更可靠的多模态AI系统奠定基础。
