# Ask in Any Modality: A Comprehensive Survey on Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08826v3

## 原始摘要

Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from hallucinations and outdated
knowledge due to their reliance on static training data. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by integrating external dynamic
information for improved factual grounding. With advances in multimodal
learning, Multimodal RAG extends this approach by incorporating multiple
modalities such as text, images, audio, and video to enhance the generated
outputs. However, cross-modal alignment and reasoning introduce unique
challenges beyond those in unimodal RAG. This survey offers a structured and
comprehensive analysis of Multimodal RAG systems, covering datasets,
benchmarks, metrics, evaluation, methodologies, and innovations in retrieval,
fusion, augmentation, and generation. We review training strategies, robustness
enhancements, loss functions, and agent-based approaches, while also exploring
the diverse Multimodal RAG scenarios. In addition, we outline open challenges
and future directions to guide research in this evolving field. This survey
lays the foundation for developing more capable and reliable AI systems that
effectively leverage multimodal dynamic external knowledge bases. All resources

## AI 摘要

这篇综述系统分析了多模态检索增强生成（Multimodal RAG）技术，旨在解决大语言模型（LLMs）因依赖静态数据导致的幻觉和知识过时问题。通过整合文本、图像、音频和视频等多模态外部动态信息，Multimodal RAG提升了生成内容的准确性，但也面临跨模态对齐和推理等新挑战。文章全面梳理了相关数据集、评估指标、方法创新（如检索、融合、增强和生成技术），以及训练策略、鲁棒性优化和基于代理的方法。最后指出了该领域的开放性问题与未来方向，为开发更可靠的多模态AI系统奠定基础。资源已开源。
