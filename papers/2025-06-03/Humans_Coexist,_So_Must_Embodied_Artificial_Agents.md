# Humans Coexist, So Must Embodied Artificial Agents

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04809v3

## 原始摘要

This paper introduces the concept of coexistence for embodied artificial
agents and argues that it is a prerequisite for long-term, in-the-wild
interaction with humans. Contemporary embodied artificial agents excel in
static, predefined tasks but fall short in dynamic and long-term interactions
with humans. On the other hand, humans can adapt and evolve continuously,
exploiting the situated knowledge embedded in their environment and other
agents, thus contributing to meaningful interactions. We take an
interdisciplinary approach at different levels of organization, drawing from
biology and design theory, to understand how human and non-human organisms
foster entities that coexist within their specific environments. Finally, we
propose key research directions for the artificial intelligence community to
develop coexisting embodied agents, focusing on the principles, hardware and
learning methods responsible for shaping them.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文提出了"具身人工智能共存"的概念，认为这是实现与人类长期自然交互的前提。当前具身AI擅长静态预设任务，但在动态长期人机交互中存在不足。相比之下，人类能持续适应进化，利用环境和其他智能体中的情境知识进行有意义的互动。研究采用跨学科方法，借鉴生物学和设计理论，分析人类与非人类有机体如何在其特定环境中实现共存。最后，论文为AI社区提出了发展共存型具身智能体的关键研究方向，重点关注塑造这类智能体的原理、硬件和学习方法。
