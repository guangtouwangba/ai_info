# Humans Coexist, So Must Embodied Artificial Agents

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04809v3

## 原始摘要

This paper introduces the concept of coexistence for embodied artificial
agents and argues that it is a prerequisite for long-term, in-the-wild
interaction with humans. Contemporary embodied artificial agents excel in
static, predefined tasks but fall short in dynamic and long-term interactions
with humans. On the other hand, humans can adapt and evolve continuously,
exploiting the situated knowledge embedded in their environment and other
agents, thus contributing to meaningful interactions. We take an
interdisciplinary approach at different levels of organization, drawing from
biology and design theory, to understand how human and non-human organisms
foster entities that coexist within their specific environments. Finally, we
propose key research directions for the artificial intelligence community to
develop coexisting embodied agents, focusing on the principles, hardware and
learning methods responsible for shaping them.


## AI 摘要

本文提出"具身智能体共存"概念，认为这是实现人机长期自然交互的前提。当前具身智能体擅长静态预设任务，却难以适应动态长期的人机互动。相比之下，人类能持续适应环境，利用情境知识促进有效互动。研究采用跨学科方法，借鉴生物学和设计理论，分析人类与其他生物如何在特定环境中实现共存。最后为AI社区提出关键研究方向：开发具共存能力的具身智能体，重点关注其构建原则、硬件设备和学习方法。该研究旨在推动能与人长期共处的智能体发展。 (99字)
