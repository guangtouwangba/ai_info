# Humans Coexist, So Must Embodied Artificial Agents

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04809v3

## 原始摘要

This paper introduces the concept of coexistence for embodied artificial
agents and argues that it is a prerequisite for long-term, in-the-wild
interaction with humans. Contemporary embodied artificial agents excel in
static, predefined tasks but fall short in dynamic and long-term interactions
with humans. On the other hand, humans can adapt and evolve continuously,
exploiting the situated knowledge embedded in their environment and other
agents, thus contributing to meaningful interactions. We take an
interdisciplinary approach at different levels of organization, drawing from
biology and design theory, to understand how human and non-human organisms
foster entities that coexist within their specific environments. Finally, we
propose key research directions for the artificial intelligence community to
develop coexisting embodied agents, focusing on the principles, hardware and
learning methods responsible for shaping them.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文提出了具身人工智能代理的"共存"概念，认为这是实现与人类长期自然交互的前提。当前AI代理在静态任务中表现出色，但缺乏动态长期交互能力。相比之下，人类能持续适应环境，利用情境知识促进有效互动。研究采用跨学科方法，借鉴生物学和设计理论，分析人类与其他生物如何在特定环境中实现共存。最后，论文为AI社区提出了开发具身共存代理的关键研究方向，包括设计原则、硬件架构和学习方法等核心要素，以推动更自然的人机长期交互。
