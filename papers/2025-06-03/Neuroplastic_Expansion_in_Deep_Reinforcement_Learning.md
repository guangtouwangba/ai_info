# Neuroplastic Expansion in Deep Reinforcement Learning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07994v3

## 原始摘要

The loss of plasticity in learning agents, analogous to the solidification of
neural pathways in biological brains, significantly impedes learning and
adaptation in reinforcement learning due to its non-stationary nature. To
address this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel approach, {\it
Neuroplastic Expansion} (NE), inspired by cortical expansion in cognitive
science. NE maintains learnability and adaptability throughout the entire
training process by dynamically growing the network from a smaller initial size
to its full dimension. Our method is designed with three key components:
(\textit{1}) elastic topology generation based on potential gradients,
(\textit{2}) dormant neuron pruning to optimize network expressivity, and
(\textit{3}) neuron consolidation via experience review to strike a balance in
the plasticity-stability dilemma. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NE
effectively mitigates plasticity loss and outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various tasks in MuJoCo and DeepMind Control Suite environments. NE
enables more adaptive learning in complex, dynamic environments, which
represents a crucial step towards transitioning deep reinforcement learning
from static, one-time training paradigms to more flexible, continually adapting
models.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种名为"神经可塑性扩展"(NE)的新方法，旨在解决强化学习中因神经可塑性丧失导致的学习和适应能力下降问题。NE受大脑皮层扩展启发，通过动态扩展网络规模来保持学习适应性，包含三个核心机制：(1)基于潜在梯度的弹性拓扑生成，(2)休眠神经元剪枝优化网络表达能力，(3)通过经验回顾实现神经元整合以平衡可塑性与稳定性。实验表明，NE能有效缓解可塑性丧失，在MuJoCo和DeepMind Control Suite任务中优于现有方法，推动深度强化学习从静态训练向持续适应模型转变。
