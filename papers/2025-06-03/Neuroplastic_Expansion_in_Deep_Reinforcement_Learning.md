# Neuroplastic Expansion in Deep Reinforcement Learning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07994v3

## 原始摘要

The loss of plasticity in learning agents, analogous to the solidification of
neural pathways in biological brains, significantly impedes learning and
adaptation in reinforcement learning due to its non-stationary nature. To
address this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel approach, {\it
Neuroplastic Expansion} (NE), inspired by cortical expansion in cognitive
science. NE maintains learnability and adaptability throughout the entire
training process by dynamically growing the network from a smaller initial size
to its full dimension. Our method is designed with three key components:
(\textit{1}) elastic topology generation based on potential gradients,
(\textit{2}) dormant neuron pruning to optimize network expressivity, and
(\textit{3}) neuron consolidation via experience review to strike a balance in
the plasticity-stability dilemma. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NE
effectively mitigates plasticity loss and outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various tasks in MuJoCo and DeepMind Control Suite environments. NE
enables more adaptive learning in complex, dynamic environments, which
represents a crucial step towards transitioning deep reinforcement learning
from static, one-time training paradigms to more flexible, continually adapting
models.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种受大脑皮层扩展启发的"神经可塑性扩展"(NE)方法，用于解决强化学习中神经网络可塑性丧失的问题。NE通过三个关键机制动态调整网络结构：(1)基于潜在梯度的弹性拓扑生成，(2)休眠神经元剪枝优化表达能力，(3)经验回顾实现神经元整合以平衡可塑性与稳定性。实验表明，NE能有效缓解可塑性丧失，在MuJoCo和DeepMind Control Suite任务中优于现有方法。该方法使深度强化学习从静态训练转向更灵活的持续适应模型，提升了在复杂动态环境中的学习能力。
