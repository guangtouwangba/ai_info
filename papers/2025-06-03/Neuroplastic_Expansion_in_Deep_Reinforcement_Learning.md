# Neuroplastic Expansion in Deep Reinforcement Learning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07994v3

## 原始摘要

The loss of plasticity in learning agents, analogous to the solidification of
neural pathways in biological brains, significantly impedes learning and
adaptation in reinforcement learning due to its non-stationary nature. To
address this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel approach, {\it
Neuroplastic Expansion} (NE), inspired by cortical expansion in cognitive
science. NE maintains learnability and adaptability throughout the entire
training process by dynamically growing the network from a smaller initial size
to its full dimension. Our method is designed with three key components:
(\textit{1}) elastic topology generation based on potential gradients,
(\textit{2}) dormant neuron pruning to optimize network expressivity, and
(\textit{3}) neuron consolidation via experience review to strike a balance in
the plasticity-stability dilemma. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NE
effectively mitigates plasticity loss and outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various tasks in MuJoCo and DeepMind Control Suite environments. NE
enables more adaptive learning in complex, dynamic environments, which
represents a crucial step towards transitioning deep reinforcement learning
from static, one-time training paradigms to more flexible, continually adapting
models.


## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种名为"神经可塑性扩展"(NE)的新方法，旨在解决强化学习中因神经通路固化导致的可塑性丧失问题。该方法受大脑皮层扩展启发，通过三个关键组件实现：(1)基于潜在梯度的弹性拓扑生成，(2)优化网络表达的休眠神经元修剪，(3)通过经验回顾平衡可塑性-稳定性权衡的神经元整合。实验表明，NE能有效缓解可塑性损失，在MuJoCo和DeepMind控制套件任务中优于现有方法。该方法推动了深度强化学习从静态训练向持续适应模型的转变，提升了智能体在动态复杂环境中的适应能力。
