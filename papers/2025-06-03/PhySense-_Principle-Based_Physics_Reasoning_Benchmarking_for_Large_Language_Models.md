# PhySense: Principle-Based Physics Reasoning Benchmarking for Large Language Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24823v1

## 原始摘要

Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced and are increasingly
capable of tackling complex scientific problems, including those in physics.
Despite this progress, current LLMs often fail to emulate the concise,
principle-based reasoning characteristic of human experts, instead generating
lengthy and opaque solutions. This discrepancy highlights a crucial gap in
their ability to apply core physical principles for efficient and interpretable
problem solving. To systematically investigate this limitation, we introduce
PhySense, a novel principle-based physics reasoning benchmark designed to be
easily solvable by experts using guiding principles, yet deceptively difficult
for LLMs without principle-first reasoning. Our evaluation across multiple
state-of-the-art LLMs and prompt types reveals a consistent failure to align
with expert-like reasoning paths, providing insights for developing AI systems
with efficient, robust and interpretable principle-based scientific reasoning.


## AI 摘要

当前大语言模型(LLMs)在解决复杂科学问题方面取得进展，但仍难以像人类专家那样进行简洁、基于原理的推理，往往产生冗长且不透明的解决方案。为系统研究这一局限，研究者开发了PhySense基准测试——该测试要求基于物理原理进行推理，对人类专家简单但对LLMs极具挑战。评估显示，现有LLMs难以遵循专家推理路径，突显了其在运用核心原理进行高效、可解释问题解决方面的不足。该研究为开发具有原理性科学推理能力的AI系统提供了重要见解。
