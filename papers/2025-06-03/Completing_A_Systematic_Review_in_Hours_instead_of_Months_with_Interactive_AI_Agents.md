# Completing A Systematic Review in Hours instead of Months with Interactive AI Agents

## 原始摘要

Systematic reviews (SRs) are vital for evidence-based practice in high stakes
disciplines, such as healthcare, but are often impeded by intensive labors and
lengthy processes that can take months to complete. Due to the high demand for
domain expertise, existing automatic summarization methods fail to accurately
identify relevant studies and generate high-quality summaries. To that end, we
introduce InsightAgent, a human-centered interactive AI agent powered by large
language models that revolutionize this workflow. InsightAgent partitions a
large literature corpus based on semantics and employs a multi-agent design for
more focused processing of literature, leading to significant improvement in
the quality of generated SRs. InsightAgent also provides intuitive
visualizations of the corpus and agent trajectories, allowing users to
effortlessly monitor the actions of the agent and provide real-time feedback
based on their expertise. Our user studies with 9 medical professionals
demonstrate that the visualization and interaction mechanisms can effectively
improve the quality of synthesized SRs by 27.2%, reaching 79.7% of
human-written quality. At the same time, user satisfaction is improved by
34.4%. With InsightAgent, it only takes a clinician about 1.5 hours, rather
than months, to complete a high-quality systematic review.


## AI 摘要

InsightAgent是一种基于大语言模型的人机交互AI代理，旨在优化系统综述（SR）的生成流程。它通过语义分割文献库，采用多代理设计进行针对性处理，显著提升综述质量。该工具提供直观的可视化界面，让用户实时监控代理操作并给予专业反馈。研究表明，其可视化与交互机制可将综述质量提升27.2%，达到人工撰写质量的79.7%，用户满意度提高34.4%。使用InsightAgent后，临床医生仅需1.5小时即可完成高质量系统综述，而传统方法需耗时数月。
