# Completing A Systematic Review in Hours instead of Months with Interactive AI Agents

## 原始摘要

Systematic reviews (SRs) are vital for evidence-based practice in high stakes
disciplines, such as healthcare, but are often impeded by intensive labors and
lengthy processes that can take months to complete. Due to the high demand for
domain expertise, existing automatic summarization methods fail to accurately
identify relevant studies and generate high-quality summaries. To that end, we
introduce InsightAgent, a human-centered interactive AI agent powered by large
language models that revolutionize this workflow. InsightAgent partitions a
large literature corpus based on semantics and employs a multi-agent design for
more focused processing of literature, leading to significant improvement in
the quality of generated SRs. InsightAgent also provides intuitive
visualizations of the corpus and agent trajectories, allowing users to
effortlessly monitor the actions of the agent and provide real-time feedback
based on their expertise. Our user studies with 9 medical professionals
demonstrate that the visualization and interaction mechanisms can effectively
improve the quality of synthesized SRs by 27.2%, reaching 79.7% of
human-written quality. At the same time, user satisfaction is improved by
34.4%. With InsightAgent, it only takes a clinician about 1.5 hours, rather
than months, to complete a high-quality systematic review.


## AI 摘要

InsightAgent是一种基于大语言模型的人机交互AI代理，旨在优化系统综述（SR）流程。传统SR耗时数月且依赖专家经验，而InsightAgent通过语义分割文献库和多代理协作处理，显著提升综述质量。其可视化界面和实时反馈机制让用户（如医疗专家）能监控并指导代理操作。实验显示，该工具将SR质量提升27.2%（达人工质量的79.7%），用户满意度提高34.4%，并将完成时间从数月缩短至1.5小时。研究证实其能高效支持循证实践，尤其在医疗等高要求领域。
