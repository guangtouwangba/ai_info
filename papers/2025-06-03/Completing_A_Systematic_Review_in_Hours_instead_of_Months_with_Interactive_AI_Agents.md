# Completing A Systematic Review in Hours instead of Months with Interactive AI Agents

## 原始摘要

Systematic reviews (SRs) are vital for evidence-based practice in high stakes
disciplines, such as healthcare, but are often impeded by intensive labors and
lengthy processes that can take months to complete. Due to the high demand for
domain expertise, existing automatic summarization methods fail to accurately
identify relevant studies and generate high-quality summaries. To that end, we
introduce InsightAgent, a human-centered interactive AI agent powered by large
language models that revolutionize this workflow. InsightAgent partitions a
large literature corpus based on semantics and employs a multi-agent design for
more focused processing of literature, leading to significant improvement in
the quality of generated SRs. InsightAgent also provides intuitive
visualizations of the corpus and agent trajectories, allowing users to
effortlessly monitor the actions of the agent and provide real-time feedback
based on their expertise. Our user studies with 9 medical professionals
demonstrate that the visualization and interaction mechanisms can effectively
improve the quality of synthesized SRs by 27.2%, reaching 79.7% of
human-written quality. At the same time, user satisfaction is improved by
34.4%. With InsightAgent, it only takes a clinician about 1.5 hours, rather
than months, to complete a high-quality systematic review.


## AI 摘要

这篇摘要介绍了InsightAgent，一种基于大语言模型的人机交互AI代理，旨在改进系统综述（SRs）的生成流程。传统SRs耗时数月且依赖领域专家，而InsightAgent通过语义分割文献库和多代理设计，显著提升SRs质量。它还提供直观的可视化界面，让用户实时监控并反馈，使医疗专业人员能在1.5小时内完成高质量SRs（接近人工质量的79.7%），效率提升27.2%，用户满意度提高34.4%。研究证明，该工具有效解决了SRs的高耗时和专家依赖问题。
