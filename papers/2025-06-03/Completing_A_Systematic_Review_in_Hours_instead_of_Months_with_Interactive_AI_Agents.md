# Completing A Systematic Review in Hours instead of Months with Interactive AI Agents

## 原始摘要

Systematic reviews (SRs) are vital for evidence-based practice in high stakes
disciplines, such as healthcare, but are often impeded by intensive labors and
lengthy processes that can take months to complete. Due to the high demand for
domain expertise, existing automatic summarization methods fail to accurately
identify relevant studies and generate high-quality summaries. To that end, we
introduce InsightAgent, a human-centered interactive AI agent powered by large
language models that revolutionize this workflow. InsightAgent partitions a
large literature corpus based on semantics and employs a multi-agent design for
more focused processing of literature, leading to significant improvement in
the quality of generated SRs. InsightAgent also provides intuitive
visualizations of the corpus and agent trajectories, allowing users to
effortlessly monitor the actions of the agent and provide real-time feedback
based on their expertise. Our user studies with 9 medical professionals
demonstrate that the visualization and interaction mechanisms can effectively
improve the quality of synthesized SRs by 27.2%, reaching 79.7% of
human-written quality. At the same time, user satisfaction is improved by
34.4%. With InsightAgent, it only takes a clinician about 1.5 hours, rather
than months, to complete a high-quality systematic review.


## AI 摘要

InsightAgent是一种基于大语言模型的交互式AI工具，旨在优化系统综述（SR）的生成流程。它通过语义划分文献库，采用多智能体设计提高处理精度，并结合可视化界面让用户实时监控和反馈。实验显示，该工具将SR质量提升27.2%，达到人工撰写质量的79.7%，用户满意度提高34.4%。使用InsightAgent后，医疗专业人员仅需1.5小时即可完成高质量SR，大幅缩短传统方法所需的数月时间。研究证实其可视化与交互机制能有效支持领域专家参与，显著提升证据合成效率。
