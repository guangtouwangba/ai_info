# Survey on Vision-Language-Action Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06851v3

## 原始摘要

This paper presents an AI-generated review of Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models, summarizing key methodologies, findings, and future directions. The
content is produced using large language models (LLMs) and is intended only for
demonstration purposes. This work does not represent original research, but
highlights how AI can help automate literature reviews. As AI-generated content
becomes more prevalent, ensuring accuracy, reliability, and proper synthesis
remains a challenge. Future research will focus on developing a structured
framework for AI-assisted literature reviews, exploring techniques to enhance
citation accuracy, source credibility, and contextual understanding. By
examining the potential and limitations of LLM in academic writing, this study
aims to contribute to the broader discussion of integrating AI into research
workflows. This work serves as a preliminary step toward establishing
systematic approaches for leveraging AI in literature review generation, making
academic knowledge synthesis more efficient and scalable.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文展示了AI生成的视觉-语言-动作(VLA)模型综述，总结了关键方法、发现和未来方向。内容由大语言模型(LLM)生成，仅用于演示目的。它并非原创研究，而是展示AI如何自动化文献综述。随着AI生成内容日益普遍，确保准确性、可靠性和合理整合仍是挑战。未来研究将聚焦于开发AI辅助文献综述的框架，提升引文准确性、来源可信度和上下文理解。通过探讨LLM在学术写作中的潜力与局限，本研究旨在促进AI融入科研流程的讨论，为建立系统化的AI文献综述方法迈出第一步。
