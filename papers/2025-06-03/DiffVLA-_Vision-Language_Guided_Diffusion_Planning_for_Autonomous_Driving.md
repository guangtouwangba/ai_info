# DiffVLA: Vision-Language Guided Diffusion Planning for Autonomous Driving

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19381v3

## 原始摘要

Research interest in end-to-end autonomous driving has surged owing to its
fully differentiable design integrating modular tasks, i.e. perception,
prediction and planing, which enables optimization in pursuit of the ultimate
goal. Despite the great potential of the end-to-end paradigm, existing methods
suffer from several aspects including expensive BEV (bird's eye view)
computation, action diversity, and sub-optimal decision in complex real-world
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid sparse-dense
diffusion policy, empowered by a Vision-Language Model (VLM), called Diff-VLA.
We explore the sparse diffusion representation for efficient multi-modal
driving behavior. Moreover, we rethink the effectiveness of VLM driving
decision and improve the trajectory generation guidance through deep
interaction across agent, map instances and VLM output. Our method shows
superior performance in Autonomous Grand Challenge 2025 which contains
challenging real and reactive synthetic scenarios. Our methods achieves 45.0
PDMS.


## AI 摘要

Diff-VLA是一种新型的端到端自动驾驶方法，通过结合稀疏-稠密扩散策略和视觉语言模型(VLM)来解决现有方法的局限性。该方法采用稀疏扩散表示实现高效的多模态驾驶行为，并利用VLM增强决策能力，通过智能体、地图实例和VLM输出的深度交互优化轨迹生成。在包含复杂真实场景和反应式合成场景的Autonomous Grand Challenge 2025中，Diff-VLA表现出色，达到了45.0 PDMS的优异性能。该方法有效解决了鸟瞰图计算成本高、动作多样性不足以及在复杂现实场景中决策次优等问题。
