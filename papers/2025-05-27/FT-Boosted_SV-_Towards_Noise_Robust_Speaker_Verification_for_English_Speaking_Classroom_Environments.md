# FT-Boosted SV: Towards Noise Robust Speaker Verification for English Speaking Classroom Environments

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20222v1

## 原始摘要

Creating Speaker Verification (SV) systems for classroom settings that are
robust to classroom noises such as babble noise is crucial for the development
of AI tools that assist educational environments. In this work, we study the
efficacy of finetuning with augmented children datasets to adapt the x-vector
and ECAPA-TDNN to classroom environments. We demonstrate that finetuning with
augmented children's datasets is powerful in that regard and reduces the Equal
Error Rate (EER) of x-vector and ECAPA-TDNN models for both classroom datasets
and children speech datasets. Notably, this method reduces EER of the
ECAPA-TDNN model on average by half (a 5 % improvement) for classrooms in the
MPT dataset compared to the ECAPA-TDNN baseline model. The x-vector model shows
an 8 % average improvement for classrooms in the NCTE dataset compared to its
baseline.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了通过微调增强儿童数据集来优化x-vector和ECAPA-TDNN模型在教室场景中的说话人验证性能。实验表明，该方法能有效降低两种模型在教室和儿童语音数据集上的等错误率(EER)。其中，ECAPA-TDNN模型在MPT教室数据集上的EER平均降低50%(提升5%)；x-vector模型在NCTE教室数据集上平均提升8%。这一方法显著提高了AI教育工具在嘈杂教室环境中的说话人识别准确性。
