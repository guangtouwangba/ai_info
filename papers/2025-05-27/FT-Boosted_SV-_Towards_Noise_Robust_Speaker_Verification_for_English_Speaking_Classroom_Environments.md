# FT-Boosted SV: Towards Noise Robust Speaker Verification for English Speaking Classroom Environments

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20222v1

## 原始摘要

Creating Speaker Verification (SV) systems for classroom settings that are
robust to classroom noises such as babble noise is crucial for the development
of AI tools that assist educational environments. In this work, we study the
efficacy of finetuning with augmented children datasets to adapt the x-vector
and ECAPA-TDNN to classroom environments. We demonstrate that finetuning with
augmented children's datasets is powerful in that regard and reduces the Equal
Error Rate (EER) of x-vector and ECAPA-TDNN models for both classroom datasets
and children speech datasets. Notably, this method reduces EER of the
ECAPA-TDNN model on average by half (a 5 % improvement) for classrooms in the
MPT dataset compared to the ECAPA-TDNN baseline model. The x-vector model shows
an 8 % average improvement for classrooms in the NCTE dataset compared to its
baseline.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了通过增强儿童数据集微调x-vector和ECAPA-TDNN模型，以提高课堂环境下的说话人验证系统性能。结果显示，该方法能有效降低两种模型在课堂数据集和儿童语音数据集上的等错误率(EER)。特别是，ECAPA-TDNN模型在MPT数据集课堂环境中的EER平均降低了一半(提升5%)，而x-vector模型在NCTE数据集课堂环境中平均提升了8%。这表明数据增强微调是提升教育场景AI工具鲁棒性的有效方法，尤其适用于存在背景噪音(如嘈杂人声)的教室环境。
