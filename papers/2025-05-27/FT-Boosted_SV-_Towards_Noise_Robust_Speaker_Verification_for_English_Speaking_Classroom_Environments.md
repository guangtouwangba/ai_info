# FT-Boosted SV: Towards Noise Robust Speaker Verification for English Speaking Classroom Environments

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20222v1

## 原始摘要

Creating Speaker Verification (SV) systems for classroom settings that are
robust to classroom noises such as babble noise is crucial for the development
of AI tools that assist educational environments. In this work, we study the
efficacy of finetuning with augmented children datasets to adapt the x-vector
and ECAPA-TDNN to classroom environments. We demonstrate that finetuning with
augmented children's datasets is powerful in that regard and reduces the Equal
Error Rate (EER) of x-vector and ECAPA-TDNN models for both classroom datasets
and children speech datasets. Notably, this method reduces EER of the
ECAPA-TDNN model on average by half (a 5 % improvement) for classrooms in the
MPT dataset compared to the ECAPA-TDNN baseline model. The x-vector model shows
an 8 % average improvement for classrooms in the NCTE dataset compared to its
baseline.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了如何通过微调增强的儿童语音数据集，使x-vector和ECAPA-TDNN模型适应教室环境，以提高说话人验证系统的鲁棒性。结果显示，该方法显著降低了两种模型在教室和儿童语音数据集上的等错误率(EER)。其中，ECAPA-TDNN模型在MPT数据集上的EER平均降低了5%（性能提升50%），而x-vector模型在NCTE数据集上的EER平均提升了8%。这表明数据增强和微调能有效优化教室场景下的说话人验证性能。
