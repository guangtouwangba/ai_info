# FT-Boosted SV: Towards Noise Robust Speaker Verification for English Speaking Classroom Environments

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20222v1

## 原始摘要

Creating Speaker Verification (SV) systems for classroom settings that are
robust to classroom noises such as babble noise is crucial for the development
of AI tools that assist educational environments. In this work, we study the
efficacy of finetuning with augmented children datasets to adapt the x-vector
and ECAPA-TDNN to classroom environments. We demonstrate that finetuning with
augmented children's datasets is powerful in that regard and reduces the Equal
Error Rate (EER) of x-vector and ECAPA-TDNN models for both classroom datasets
and children speech datasets. Notably, this method reduces EER of the
ECAPA-TDNN model on average by half (a 5 % improvement) for classrooms in the
MPT dataset compared to the ECAPA-TDNN baseline model. The x-vector model shows
an 8 % average improvement for classrooms in the NCTE dataset compared to its
baseline.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了在教室环境中优化说话人验证(SV)系统的方法，重点针对儿童语音和背景噪声(如嘈杂人声)的挑战。通过使用增强的儿童数据集微调x-vector和ECAPA-TDNN模型，显著降低了两种模型在教室数据集和儿童语音数据集上的等错误率(EER)。结果显示，ECAPA-TDNN模型在MPT数据集上的EER平均降低了50%(提升5%)，而x-vector模型在NCTE数据集上平均提升了8%。这表明数据增强和微调能有效提高教室环境下的说话人验证性能。
