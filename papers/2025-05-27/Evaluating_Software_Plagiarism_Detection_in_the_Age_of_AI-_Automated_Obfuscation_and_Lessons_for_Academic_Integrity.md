# Evaluating Software Plagiarism Detection in the Age of AI: Automated Obfuscation and Lessons for Academic Integrity

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20158v1

## 原始摘要

Plagiarism in programming assignments is a persistent issue in computer
science education, increasingly complicated by the emergence of automated
obfuscation attacks. While software plagiarism detectors are widely used to
identify suspicious similarities at scale and are resilient to simple
obfuscation techniques, they are vulnerable to advanced obfuscation based on
structural modification of program code that preserves the original program
behavior. While different defense mechanisms have been proposed to increase
resilience against these attacks, their current evaluation is limited to the
scope of attacks used and lacks a comprehensive investigation regarding
AI-based obfuscation. In this paper, we investigate the resilience of these
defense mechanisms against a broad range of automated obfuscation attacks,
including both algorithmic and AI-generated methods, and for a wide variety of
real-world datasets. We evaluate the improvements of two defense mechanisms
over the plagiarism detector JPlag across over four million pairwise program
comparisons. Our results show significant improvements in detecting obfuscated
plagiarism instances, and we observe an improved detection of AI-generated
programs, even though the defense mechanisms are not designed for this use
case. Based on our findings, we provide an in-depth discussion of their broader
implications for academic integrity and the role of AI in education.


## AI 摘要

编程作业抄袭是计算机教育中的长期问题，而自动化混淆攻击的出现使其更加复杂。现有抄袭检测工具能识别简单相似性，但对保留程序行为的结构性代码混淆攻击防御不足。本研究评估了两种防御机制对广泛混淆攻击（包括算法和AI生成方法）的抵抗能力，基于400多万次程序对比测试。结果显示，这些机制显著提升了对混淆抄袭的检测能力，并意外提高了对AI生成程序的识别率（尽管并非为此设计）。研究还探讨了其对学术诚信和AI教育应用的深远影响。
