# Agentic AI Process Observability: Discovering Behavioral Variability

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20127v1

## 原始摘要

AI agents that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly
becoming core building blocks of modern software systems. A wide range of
frameworks is now available to support the specification of such applications.
These frameworks enable the definition of agent setups using natural language
prompting, which specifies the roles, goals, and tools assigned to the various
agents involved. Within such setups, agent behavior is non-deterministic for
any given input, highlighting the critical need for robust debugging and
observability tools. In this work, we explore the use of process and causal
discovery applied to agent execution trajectories as a means of enhancing
developer observability. This approach aids in monitoring and understanding the
emergent variability in agent behavior. Additionally, we complement this with
LLM-based static analysis techniques to distinguish between intended and
unintended behavioral variability. We argue that such instrumentation is
essential for giving developers greater control over evolving specifications
and for identifying aspects of functionality that may require more precise and
explicit definitions.


## AI 摘要

大型语言模型（LLM）驱动的AI代理正成为现代软件系统的核心组件。尽管现有框架支持通过自然语言提示定义代理角色、目标和工具，但其行为具有不确定性，亟需增强调试与可观测性工具。本研究提出利用流程和因果发现分析代理执行轨迹，帮助开发者监控和理解行为变异。同时结合基于LLM的静态分析技术，区分预期与非预期的行为差异。这种工具链对开发者掌控动态规范演进、识别需明确定义的功能模块至关重要，为LLM代理系统的可靠性提供了新方法论。
