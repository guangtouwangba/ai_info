# Virtual Cells: Predict, Explain, Discover

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14613v2

## 原始摘要

Drug discovery is fundamentally a process of inferring the effects of
treatments on patients, and would therefore benefit immensely from
computational models that can reliably simulate patient responses, enabling
researchers to generate and test large numbers of therapeutic hypotheses safely
and economically before initiating costly clinical trials. Even a more specific
model that predicts the functional response of cells to a wide range of
perturbations would be tremendously valuable for discovering safe and effective
treatments that successfully translate to the clinic. Creating such virtual
cells has long been a goal of the computational research community that
unfortunately remains unachieved given the daunting complexity and scale of
cellular biology. Nevertheless, recent advances in AI, computing power, lab
automation, and high-throughput cellular profiling provide new opportunities
for reaching this goal. In this perspective, we present a vision for developing
and evaluating virtual cells that builds on our experience at Recursion. We
argue that in order to be a useful tool to discover novel biology, virtual
cells must accurately predict the functional response of a cell to
perturbations and explain how the predicted response is a consequence of
modifications to key biomolecular interactions. We then introduce key
principles for designing therapeutically-relevant virtual cells, describe a
lab-in-the-loop approach for generating novel insights with them, and advocate
for biologically-grounded benchmarks to guide virtual cell development.
Finally, we make the case that our approach to virtual cells provides a useful
framework for building other models at higher levels of organization, including
virtual patients. We hope that these directions prove useful to the research
community in developing virtual models optimized for positive impact on drug
discovery outcomes.


## AI 摘要

药物发现本质上是一个推断治疗对患者影响的过程，若能建立可靠模拟患者反应的虚拟细胞模型，将极大助力药物研发。这类模型可预测细胞对各种干预的功能性反应，帮助筛选安全有效的治疗方案，降低临床试验成本。尽管细胞生物学的复杂性使这一目标长期未能实现，但AI、计算能力、实验室自动化和高通量细胞分析等技术的进步带来了新机遇。本文提出开发治疗相关虚拟细胞的关键原则，强调模型需准确预测细胞反应并解释其分子机制，同时倡导建立生物学基准来指导开发，最终推动药物发现取得突破性进展。（99字）
