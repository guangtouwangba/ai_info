# Virtual Cells: Predict, Explain, Discover

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14613v2

## 原始摘要

Drug discovery is fundamentally a process of inferring the effects of
treatments on patients, and would therefore benefit immensely from
computational models that can reliably simulate patient responses, enabling
researchers to generate and test large numbers of therapeutic hypotheses safely
and economically before initiating costly clinical trials. Even a more specific
model that predicts the functional response of cells to a wide range of
perturbations would be tremendously valuable for discovering safe and effective
treatments that successfully translate to the clinic. Creating such virtual
cells has long been a goal of the computational research community that
unfortunately remains unachieved given the daunting complexity and scale of
cellular biology. Nevertheless, recent advances in AI, computing power, lab
automation, and high-throughput cellular profiling provide new opportunities
for reaching this goal. In this perspective, we present a vision for developing
and evaluating virtual cells that builds on our experience at Recursion. We
argue that in order to be a useful tool to discover novel biology, virtual
cells must accurately predict the functional response of a cell to
perturbations and explain how the predicted response is a consequence of
modifications to key biomolecular interactions. We then introduce key
principles for designing therapeutically-relevant virtual cells, describe a
lab-in-the-loop approach for generating novel insights with them, and advocate
for biologically-grounded benchmarks to guide virtual cell development.
Finally, we make the case that our approach to virtual cells provides a useful
framework for building other models at higher levels of organization, including
virtual patients. We hope that these directions prove useful to the research
community in developing virtual models optimized for positive impact on drug
discovery outcomes.


## AI 摘要

药物研发的核心在于预测治疗对患者的影响，而能够可靠模拟患者反应的虚拟细胞模型将极大推动这一进程。这类模型可帮助研究者低成本生成并测试大量治疗假设，再进入昂贵的临床试验。尽管细胞生物学的复杂性使构建虚拟细胞长期面临挑战，但AI、算力、自动化实验和高通量细胞分析等技术的进步带来了新机遇。理想的虚拟细胞应能准确预测细胞对干扰的功能反应，并解释关键生物分子相互作用如何导致该反应。本文提出构建治疗相关虚拟细胞的关键原则，强调"实验闭环"开发模式及基于生物学的评估标准，并指出该框架可扩展至更高层级的虚拟患者模型。
