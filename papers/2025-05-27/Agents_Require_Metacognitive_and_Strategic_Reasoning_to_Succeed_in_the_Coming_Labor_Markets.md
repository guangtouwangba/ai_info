# Agents Require Metacognitive and Strategic Reasoning to Succeed in the Coming Labor Markets

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20120v1

## 原始摘要

Current labor markets are strongly affected by the economic forces of adverse
selection, moral hazard, and reputation, each of which arises due to
$\textit{incomplete information}$. These economic forces will still be
influential after AI agents are introduced, and thus, agents must use
metacognitive and strategic reasoning to perform effectively. Metacognition is
a form of $\textit{internal reasoning}$ that includes the capabilities for
self-assessment, task understanding, and evaluation of strategies. Strategic
reasoning is $\textit{external reasoning}$ that covers holding beliefs about
other participants in the labor market (e.g., competitors, colleagues), making
strategic decisions, and learning about others over time. Both types of
reasoning are required by agents as they decide among the many
$\textit{actions}$ they can take in labor markets, both within and outside
their jobs. We discuss current research into metacognitive and strategic
reasoning and the areas requiring further development.


## AI 摘要

当前劳动力市场深受信息不完全带来的逆向选择、道德风险和声誉问题影响。即便引入AI代理后，这些经济力量仍将持续发挥作用，因此代理需具备元认知和战略推理能力。元认知是包含自我评估、任务理解和策略评价的内部推理；战略推理则是涉及对市场参与者（如竞争者、同事）的信念、战略决策和长期学习的对外推理。代理在劳动力市场中采取行动时，需要综合运用这两种推理能力。现有研究已开始探索这些方向，但仍需进一步深化相关领域的发展。
