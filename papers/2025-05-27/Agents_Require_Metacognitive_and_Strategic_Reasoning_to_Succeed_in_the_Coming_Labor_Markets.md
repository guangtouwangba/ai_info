# Agents Require Metacognitive and Strategic Reasoning to Succeed in the Coming Labor Markets

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20120v1

## 原始摘要

Current labor markets are strongly affected by the economic forces of adverse
selection, moral hazard, and reputation, each of which arises due to
$\textit{incomplete information}$. These economic forces will still be
influential after AI agents are introduced, and thus, agents must use
metacognitive and strategic reasoning to perform effectively. Metacognition is
a form of $\textit{internal reasoning}$ that includes the capabilities for
self-assessment, task understanding, and evaluation of strategies. Strategic
reasoning is $\textit{external reasoning}$ that covers holding beliefs about
other participants in the labor market (e.g., competitors, colleagues), making
strategic decisions, and learning about others over time. Both types of
reasoning are required by agents as they decide among the many
$\textit{actions}$ they can take in labor markets, both within and outside
their jobs. We discuss current research into metacognitive and strategic
reasoning and the areas requiring further development.


## AI 摘要

当前劳动力市场深受逆向选择、道德风险和声誉等不完全信息经济力量的影响。即便引入AI代理后，这些因素仍将发挥作用，因此代理需具备元认知和战略推理能力。元认知是涉及自我评估、任务理解和策略评价的内部推理；战略推理则是关于竞争对手等市场参与者的信念形成、战略决策和持续学习的对外推理。代理在职场内外行动时需同时运用这两种能力。本文探讨了相关研究现状及未来发展方向。
