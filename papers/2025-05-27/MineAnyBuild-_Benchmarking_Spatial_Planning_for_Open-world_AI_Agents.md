# MineAnyBuild: Benchmarking Spatial Planning for Open-world AI Agents

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20148v1

## 原始摘要

Spatial Planning is a crucial part in the field of spatial intelligence,
which requires the understanding and planning about object arrangements in
space perspective. AI agents with the spatial planning ability can better adapt
to various real-world applications, including robotic manipulation, automatic
assembly, urban planning etc. Recent works have attempted to construct
benchmarks for evaluating the spatial intelligence of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Nevertheless, these benchmarks primarily focus on spatial
reasoning based on typical Visual Question-Answering (VQA) forms, which suffers
from the gap between abstract spatial understanding and concrete task
execution. In this work, we take a step further to build a comprehensive
benchmark called MineAnyBuild, aiming to evaluate the spatial planning ability
of open-world AI agents in the Minecraft game. Specifically, MineAnyBuild
requires an agent to generate executable architecture building plans based on
the given multi-modal human instructions. It involves 4,000 curated spatial
planning tasks and also provides a paradigm for infinitely expandable data
collection by utilizing rich player-generated content. MineAnyBuild evaluates
spatial planning through four core supporting dimensions: spatial
understanding, spatial reasoning, creativity, and spatial commonsense. Based on
MineAnyBuild, we perform a comprehensive evaluation for existing MLLM-based
agents, revealing the severe limitations but enormous potential in their
spatial planning abilities. We believe our MineAnyBuild will open new avenues
for the evaluation of spatial intelligence and help promote further development
for open-world AI agents capable of spatial planning.


## AI 摘要

《MineAnyBuild》是一个评估开放世界AI代理空间规划能力的综合性基准测试，基于《我的世界》游戏构建。该测试包含4,000个精心设计的空间规划任务，要求AI根据多模态指令生成可执行的建筑方案，并支持利用玩家生成内容无限扩展数据。它从空间理解、空间推理、创造力和空间常识四个维度评估能力。研究发现，现有基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的代理在空间规划上虽存在明显局限，但潜力巨大。该基准为空间智能评估开辟了新途径，将推动具备空间规划能力的开放世界AI代理进一步发展。
