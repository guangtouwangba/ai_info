## 原始摘要

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, particularly those based on machine
learning (ML), become integral to high-stakes applications, their probabilistic
and opaque nature poses significant challenges to traditional verification and
validation methods. These challenges are exacerbated in regulated sectors
requiring tamper-proof, auditable evidence, as highlighted by apposite legal
frameworks, e.g., the EU AI Act. Conversely, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) offer
a cryptographic solution that enables provers to demonstrate, through verified
computations, adherence to set requirements without revealing sensitive model
details or data. Through a systematic survey of ZKP protocols, we identify five
key properties (non-interactivity, transparent setup, standard representations,
succinctness, and post-quantum security) critical for their application in AI
validation and verification pipelines. Subsequently, we perform a follow-up
systematic survey analyzing ZKP-enhanced ML applications across an adaptation
of the Team Data Science Process (TDSP) model (Data &amp; Preprocessing, Training &amp;
Offline Metrics, Inference, and Online Metrics), detailing verification
objectives, ML models, and adopted protocols. Our findings indicate that
current research on ZKP-Enhanced ML primarily focuses on inference
verification, while the data preprocessing and training stages remain
underexplored. Most notably, our analysis identifies a significant convergence
within the research domain toward the development of a unified Zero-Knowledge
Machine Learning Operations (ZKMLOps) framework. This emerging framework
leverages ZKPs to provide robust cryptographic guarantees of correctness,
integrity, and privacy, thereby promoting enhanced accountability,
transparency, and compliance with Trustworthy AI principles.


## AI 摘要

随着AI系统在高风险应用中的普及，其概率性和不透明性对传统验证方法提出了挑战。零知识证明（ZKP）作为一种密码学解决方案，能在不泄露敏感信息的前提下验证AI模型合规性。研究发现，当前ZKP增强的机器学习研究主要集中在推理验证阶段，而数据预处理和训练阶段仍待探索。研究领域正显著趋向于开发统一的零知识机器学习运维（ZKMLOps）框架，该框架利用ZKP提供正确性、完整性和隐私性的加密保证，从而增强AI系统的可问责性、透明性，并符合可信AI原则。
