## 原始摘要

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, particularly those based on machine
learning (ML), become integral to high-stakes applications, their probabilistic
and opaque nature poses significant challenges to traditional verification and
validation methods. These challenges are exacerbated in regulated sectors
requiring tamper-proof, auditable evidence, as highlighted by apposite legal
frameworks, e.g., the EU AI Act. Conversely, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) offer
a cryptographic solution that enables provers to demonstrate, through verified
computations, adherence to set requirements without revealing sensitive model
details or data. Through a systematic survey of ZKP protocols, we identify five
key properties (non-interactivity, transparent setup, standard representations,
succinctness, and post-quantum security) critical for their application in AI
validation and verification pipelines. Subsequently, we perform a follow-up
systematic survey analyzing ZKP-enhanced ML applications across an adaptation
of the Team Data Science Process (TDSP) model (Data &amp; Preprocessing, Training &amp;
Offline Metrics, Inference, and Online Metrics), detailing verification
objectives, ML models, and adopted protocols. Our findings indicate that
current research on ZKP-Enhanced ML primarily focuses on inference
verification, while the data preprocessing and training stages remain
underexplored. Most notably, our analysis identifies a significant convergence
within the research domain toward the development of a unified Zero-Knowledge
Machine Learning Operations (ZKMLOps) framework. This emerging framework
leverages ZKPs to provide robust cryptographic guarantees of correctness,
integrity, and privacy, thereby promoting enhanced accountability,
transparency, and compliance with Trustworthy AI principles.


## AI 摘要

随着AI系统在关键领域的应用增加，其概率性和不透明性对传统验证方法提出了挑战。零知识证明（ZKP）通过加密计算提供验证方案，能在不泄露敏感信息的情况下证明合规性。研究分析了ZKP协议的五个关键特性（非交互性、透明设置等），并调查了ZKP在机器学习（ML）流程中的应用现状。当前研究主要集中于推理验证，而数据预处理和训练阶段仍待探索。分析发现，该领域正趋向于开发统一的零知识机器学习运维（ZKMLOps）框架，以增强AI的可信性、透明性和合规性。
