## 原始摘要

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, particularly those based on machine
learning (ML), become integral to high-stakes applications, their probabilistic
and opaque nature poses significant challenges to traditional verification and
validation methods. These challenges are exacerbated in regulated sectors
requiring tamper-proof, auditable evidence, as highlighted by apposite legal
frameworks, e.g., the EU AI Act. Conversely, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) offer
a cryptographic solution that enables provers to demonstrate, through verified
computations, adherence to set requirements without revealing sensitive model
details or data. Through a systematic survey of ZKP protocols, we identify five
key properties (non-interactivity, transparent setup, standard representations,
succinctness, and post-quantum security) critical for their application in AI
validation and verification pipelines. Subsequently, we perform a follow-up
systematic survey analyzing ZKP-enhanced ML applications across an adaptation
of the Team Data Science Process (TDSP) model (Data &amp; Preprocessing, Training &amp;
Offline Metrics, Inference, and Online Metrics), detailing verification
objectives, ML models, and adopted protocols. Our findings indicate that
current research on ZKP-Enhanced ML primarily focuses on inference
verification, while the data preprocessing and training stages remain
underexplored. Most notably, our analysis identifies a significant convergence
within the research domain toward the development of a unified Zero-Knowledge
Machine Learning Operations (ZKMLOps) framework. This emerging framework
leverages ZKPs to provide robust cryptographic guarantees of correctness,
integrity, and privacy, thereby promoting enhanced accountability,
transparency, and compliance with Trustworthy AI principles.


## AI 摘要

随着AI系统在高风险领域的广泛应用，其概率性和不透明性给传统验证方法带来挑战，尤其在需要防篡改审计的监管领域。零知识证明(ZKP)通过加密计算可在不泄露敏感信息的前提下验证合规性。研究系统梳理了ZKP协议在机器学习验证中的五大关键特性，并分析了ZKP增强型ML应用在数据处理、训练、推理等环节的现状。当前研究主要集中在推理验证，而数据预处理和训练阶段尚待探索。研究发现该领域正向"零知识机器学习运维"(ZKMLOps)框架发展，通过ZKP提供正确性、完整性和隐私的加密保证，促进可信AI原则的实现。
