# Seeing is Believing, but How Much? A Comprehensive Analysis of Verbalized Calibration in Vision-Language Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20236v1

## 原始摘要

Uncertainty quantification is essential for assessing the reliability and
trustworthiness of modern AI systems. Among existing approaches, verbalized
uncertainty, where models express their confidence through natural language,
has emerged as a lightweight and interpretable solution in large language
models (LLMs). However, its effectiveness in vision-language models (VLMs)
remains insufficiently studied. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of verbalized confidence in VLMs, spanning three model categories,
four task domains, and three evaluation scenarios. Our results show that
current VLMs often display notable miscalibration across diverse tasks and
settings. Notably, visual reasoning models (i.e., thinking with images)
consistently exhibit better calibration, suggesting that modality-specific
reasoning is critical for reliable uncertainty estimation. To further address
calibration challenges, we introduce Visual Confidence-Aware Prompting, a
two-stage prompting strategy that improves confidence alignment in multimodal
settings. Overall, our study highlights the inherent miscalibration in VLMs
across modalities. More broadly, our findings underscore the fundamental
importance of modality alignment and model faithfulness in advancing reliable
multimodal systems.


## AI 摘要

当前研究评估了视觉语言模型(VLM)中语言化不确定性的校准效果，发现现有VLM在多任务和场景下普遍存在校准不足问题。值得注意的是，视觉推理模型表现出更好的校准性，表明特定模态推理对可靠的不确定性估计至关重要。为改善校准问题，研究者提出两阶段的视觉置信度提示策略。该研究揭示了VLM跨模态校准不足的现状，强调了模态对齐和模型可信度对发展可靠多模态系统的基础重要性。研究覆盖3类模型、4个任务领域和3种评估场景，为VLM不确定性量化提供了全面洞见。
