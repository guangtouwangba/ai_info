# Seeing is Believing, but How Much? A Comprehensive Analysis of Verbalized Calibration in Vision-Language Models

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20236v1

## 原始摘要

Uncertainty quantification is essential for assessing the reliability and
trustworthiness of modern AI systems. Among existing approaches, verbalized
uncertainty, where models express their confidence through natural language,
has emerged as a lightweight and interpretable solution in large language
models (LLMs). However, its effectiveness in vision-language models (VLMs)
remains insufficiently studied. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of verbalized confidence in VLMs, spanning three model categories,
four task domains, and three evaluation scenarios. Our results show that
current VLMs often display notable miscalibration across diverse tasks and
settings. Notably, visual reasoning models (i.e., thinking with images)
consistently exhibit better calibration, suggesting that modality-specific
reasoning is critical for reliable uncertainty estimation. To further address
calibration challenges, we introduce Visual Confidence-Aware Prompting, a
two-stage prompting strategy that improves confidence alignment in multimodal
settings. Overall, our study highlights the inherent miscalibration in VLMs
across modalities. More broadly, our findings underscore the fundamental
importance of modality alignment and model faithfulness in advancing reliable
multimodal systems.


## AI 摘要

该研究评估了视觉语言模型(VLMs)中语言化不确定性的校准表现，发现现有模型在多任务和场景中存在明显校准不足。视觉推理模型表现更好，表明模态特定推理对可靠不确定性估计至关重要。研究提出视觉置信感知提示法，通过两阶段提示策略改善多模态置信对齐。结果表明，跨模态校准不足是VLMs的固有挑战，模态对齐和模型忠实性对发展可靠多模态系统具有基础重要性。研究涵盖3类模型、4个任务域和3种评估场景，为VLMs的不确定性量化提供了全面洞见。
