# The Problem of Algorithmic Collisions: Mitigating Unforeseen Risks in a Connected World

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20181v1

## 原始摘要

The increasing deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other
autonomous algorithmic systems presents the world with new systemic risks.
While focus often lies on the function of individual algorithms, a critical and
underestimated danger arises from their interactions, particularly when
algorithmic systems operate without awareness of each other, or when those
deploying them are unaware of the full algorithmic ecosystem deployment is
occurring in. These interactions can lead to unforeseen, rapidly escalating
negative outcomes - from market crashes and energy supply disruptions to
potential physical accidents and erosion of public trust - often exceeding the
human capacity for effective monitoring and the legal capacities for proper
intervention. Current governance frameworks are inadequate as they lack
visibility into this complex ecosystem of interactions. This paper outlines the
nature of this challenge and proposes some initial policy suggestions centered
on increasing transparency and accountability through phased system
registration, a licensing framework for deployment, and enhanced monitoring
capabilities.


## AI 摘要

人工智能（AI）和自主算法系统的广泛应用带来了新的系统性风险。虽然关注点常集中在单个算法上，但更大的危险来自算法间的交互，尤其是当系统彼此不知情或部署者不了解整个算法生态时。这些交互可能导致市场崩溃、能源中断、安全事故和公众信任丧失等不可预见的连锁反应，超出人类和法律监管的能力。现有治理框架因缺乏对复杂算法生态的可见性而难以应对。本文提出分阶段系统注册、部署许可框架和增强监控能力等政策建议，以提高透明度和问责制。
