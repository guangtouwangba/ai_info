# The Problem of Algorithmic Collisions: Mitigating Unforeseen Risks in a Connected World

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20181v1

## 原始摘要

The increasing deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other
autonomous algorithmic systems presents the world with new systemic risks.
While focus often lies on the function of individual algorithms, a critical and
underestimated danger arises from their interactions, particularly when
algorithmic systems operate without awareness of each other, or when those
deploying them are unaware of the full algorithmic ecosystem deployment is
occurring in. These interactions can lead to unforeseen, rapidly escalating
negative outcomes - from market crashes and energy supply disruptions to
potential physical accidents and erosion of public trust - often exceeding the
human capacity for effective monitoring and the legal capacities for proper
intervention. Current governance frameworks are inadequate as they lack
visibility into this complex ecosystem of interactions. This paper outlines the
nature of this challenge and proposes some initial policy suggestions centered
on increasing transparency and accountability through phased system
registration, a licensing framework for deployment, and enhanced monitoring
capabilities.


## AI 摘要

随着人工智能和自主算法系统的广泛应用，新的系统性风险正在显现。当前风险主要来自算法间的无意识交互，导致市场崩溃、能源中断等不可预见的连锁反应，甚至超出人类监控和法律干预能力。现有治理框架因缺乏对复杂算法生态的可见性而难以应对。该研究提出分阶段系统注册、部署许可框架和强化监测能力等政策建议，以提升透明度和问责制，从而降低算法交互带来的系统性风险。
