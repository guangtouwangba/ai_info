# Advancing DevSecOps in SMEs: Challenges and Best Practices for Secure CI/CD Pipelines

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22612v1

## 原始摘要

This study evaluates the adoption of DevSecOps among small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs), identifying key challenges, best practices, and future
trends. Through a mixed methods approach backed by the Technology Acceptance
Model (TAM) and Diffusion of Innovations (DOI) theory, we analyzed survey data
from 405 SME professionals, revealing that while 68% have implemented
DevSecOps, adoption is hindered by technical complexity (41%), resource
constraints (35%), and cultural resistance (38%). Despite strong leadership
prioritization of security (73%), automation gaps persist, with only 12% of
organizations conducting security scans per commit.
  Our findings highlight a growing integration of security tools, particularly
API security (63%) and software composition analysis (62%), although container
security adoption remains low (34%). Looking ahead, SMEs anticipate artificial
intelligence and machine learning to significantly influence DevSecOps,
underscoring the need for proactive adoption of AI-driven security
enhancements. Based on our findings, this research proposes strategic best
practices to enhance CI/CD pipeline security including automation,
leadership-driven security culture, and cross-team collaboration.


## AI 摘要

该研究评估了中小型企业(SMEs)采用DevSecOps的情况，发现68%的企业已实施DevSecOps，但面临技术复杂性(41%)、资源限制(35%)和文化阻力(38%)等挑战。尽管73%的企业领导重视安全，但自动化程度不足，仅12%的企业在每次提交时进行安全扫描。研究显示API安全(63%)和软件组成分析(62%)工具使用较多，但容器安全采用率较低(34%)。未来，AI/ML将对DevSecOps产生重要影响。研究建议通过自动化、领导驱动的安全文化和跨团队协作来增强CI/CD管道安全性。
