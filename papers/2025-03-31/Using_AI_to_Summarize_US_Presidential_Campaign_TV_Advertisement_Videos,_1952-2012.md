# Using AI to Summarize US Presidential Campaign TV Advertisement Videos, 1952-2012

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22589v1

## 原始摘要

This paper introduces the largest and most comprehensive dataset of US
presidential campaign television advertisements, available in digital format.
The dataset also includes machine-searchable transcripts and high-quality
summaries designed to facilitate a variety of academic research. To date, there
has been great interest in collecting and analyzing US presidential campaign
advertisements, but the need for manual procurement and annotation led many to
rely on smaller subsets. We design a large-scale parallelized, AI-based
analysis pipeline that automates the laborious process of preparing,
transcribing, and summarizing videos. We then apply this methodology to the
9,707 presidential ads from the Julian P. Kanter Political Commercial Archive.
We conduct extensive human evaluations to show that these transcripts and
summaries match the quality of manually generated alternatives. We illustrate
the value of this data by including an application that tracks the genesis and
evolution of current focal issue areas over seven decades of presidential
elections. Our analysis pipeline and codebase also show how to use LLM-based
tools to obtain high-quality summaries for other video datasets.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文介绍了美国最大最全面的总统竞选电视广告数据集，包含数字格式广告、机器可搜索的文本转录和高质量摘要，便于学术研究。传统方法依赖人工收集和小样本，而作者开发了基于AI的自动化处理流程，对Kanter政治广告档案馆的9,707个广告进行转录和摘要。人工评估证实其质量堪比人工生成结果。研究还展示了该数据的应用价值，如追踪70年间竞选核心议题的演变。该AI处理流程和代码库为其他视频数据集的高质量摘要生成提供了范例。
