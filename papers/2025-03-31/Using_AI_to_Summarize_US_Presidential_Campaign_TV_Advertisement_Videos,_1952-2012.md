# Using AI to Summarize US Presidential Campaign TV Advertisement Videos, 1952-2012

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22589v1

## 原始摘要

This paper introduces the largest and most comprehensive dataset of US
presidential campaign television advertisements, available in digital format.
The dataset also includes machine-searchable transcripts and high-quality
summaries designed to facilitate a variety of academic research. To date, there
has been great interest in collecting and analyzing US presidential campaign
advertisements, but the need for manual procurement and annotation led many to
rely on smaller subsets. We design a large-scale parallelized, AI-based
analysis pipeline that automates the laborious process of preparing,
transcribing, and summarizing videos. We then apply this methodology to the
9,707 presidential ads from the Julian P. Kanter Political Commercial Archive.
We conduct extensive human evaluations to show that these transcripts and
summaries match the quality of manually generated alternatives. We illustrate
the value of this data by including an application that tracks the genesis and
evolution of current focal issue areas over seven decades of presidential
elections. Our analysis pipeline and codebase also show how to use LLM-based
tools to obtain high-quality summaries for other video datasets.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文介绍了美国最大最全面的总统竞选电视广告数字数据集，包含9,707个广告，配有机器可搜索的转录文本和高质量摘要。研究团队开发了基于AI的自动化分析流程，替代传统人工处理方式，大幅提升了数据处理效率。经评估，这些自动生成的转录和摘要质量与人工制作相当。作为应用示例，研究追踪了70年间总统选举核心议题的演变过程。该数据集为学术研究提供了宝贵资源，同时展示了大语言模型在处理其他视频数据集方面的潜力，为类似研究提供了可复用的技术方案。
