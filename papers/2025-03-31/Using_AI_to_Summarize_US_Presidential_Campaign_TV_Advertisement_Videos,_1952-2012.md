# Using AI to Summarize US Presidential Campaign TV Advertisement Videos, 1952-2012

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22589v1

## 原始摘要

This paper introduces the largest and most comprehensive dataset of US
presidential campaign television advertisements, available in digital format.
The dataset also includes machine-searchable transcripts and high-quality
summaries designed to facilitate a variety of academic research. To date, there
has been great interest in collecting and analyzing US presidential campaign
advertisements, but the need for manual procurement and annotation led many to
rely on smaller subsets. We design a large-scale parallelized, AI-based
analysis pipeline that automates the laborious process of preparing,
transcribing, and summarizing videos. We then apply this methodology to the
9,707 presidential ads from the Julian P. Kanter Political Commercial Archive.
We conduct extensive human evaluations to show that these transcripts and
summaries match the quality of manually generated alternatives. We illustrate
the value of this data by including an application that tracks the genesis and
evolution of current focal issue areas over seven decades of presidential
elections. Our analysis pipeline and codebase also show how to use LLM-based
tools to obtain high-quality summaries for other video datasets.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文介绍了一个规模最大、内容最全面的美国总统竞选电视广告数据集，包含数字化视频、可机器检索的字幕和高质量摘要，旨在促进学术研究。传统方法依赖人工收集和标注，导致样本有限。作者开发了一个基于AI的并行分析流程，自动完成视频准备、转录和摘要生成，并应用于9,707个竞选广告。人工评估显示其质量与人工生成结果相当。研究还展示了该数据在追踪70年间竞选焦点议题演变的应用价值。该分析流程和代码库展示了如何利用大语言模型工具为其他视频数据集生成高质量摘要。
