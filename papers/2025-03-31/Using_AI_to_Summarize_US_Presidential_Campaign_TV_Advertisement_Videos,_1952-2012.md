# Using AI to Summarize US Presidential Campaign TV Advertisement Videos, 1952-2012

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22589v1

## 原始摘要

This paper introduces the largest and most comprehensive dataset of US
presidential campaign television advertisements, available in digital format.
The dataset also includes machine-searchable transcripts and high-quality
summaries designed to facilitate a variety of academic research. To date, there
has been great interest in collecting and analyzing US presidential campaign
advertisements, but the need for manual procurement and annotation led many to
rely on smaller subsets. We design a large-scale parallelized, AI-based
analysis pipeline that automates the laborious process of preparing,
transcribing, and summarizing videos. We then apply this methodology to the
9,707 presidential ads from the Julian P. Kanter Political Commercial Archive.
We conduct extensive human evaluations to show that these transcripts and
summaries match the quality of manually generated alternatives. We illustrate
the value of this data by including an application that tracks the genesis and
evolution of current focal issue areas over seven decades of presidential
elections. Our analysis pipeline and codebase also show how to use LLM-based
tools to obtain high-quality summaries for other video datasets.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文介绍了一个最大最全面的美国总统竞选电视广告数字数据集，包含9,707个广告，配有机器可搜索的转录文本和高质量摘要。研究团队开发了基于AI的自动化分析流程，大幅简化了传统人工处理视频的繁琐过程。通过人工评估验证，这些自动生成的转录和摘要质量与人工制作相当。该数据集支持多种学术研究，论文还展示了如何利用这些数据追踪70年来竞选焦点议题的演变。研究方法和代码库为其他视频数据集的高质量摘要生成提供了参考范例。
