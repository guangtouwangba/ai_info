# AI Literacy in K-12 and Higher Education in the Wake of Generative AI: An Integrative Review

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00079v3

## 原始摘要

Even though AI literacy has emerged as a prominent education topic in the
wake of generative AI, its definition remains vague. There is little consensus
among researchers and practitioners on how to discuss and design AI literacy
interventions. The term has been used to describe both learning activities that
train undergraduate students to use ChatGPT effectively and having kindergarten
children interact with social robots. This paper applies an integrative review
method to examine empirical and theoretical AI literacy studies published since
2020. In synthesizing the 124 reviewed studies, three ways to conceptualize
literacy-functional, critical, and indirectly beneficial-and three perspectives
on AI-technical detail, tool, and sociocultural-were identified, forming a
framework that reflects the spectrum of how AI literacy is approached in
practice. The framework highlights the need for more specialized terms within
AI literacy discourse and indicates research gaps in certain AI literacy
objectives.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文通过整合2020年以来的124项AI素养研究，提出了一个框架来厘清这一模糊概念。研究发现，AI素养可从三个维度理解：功能性（如使用ChatGPT）、批判性（如评估AI影响）和间接获益性（如与社交机器人互动）；同时存在三种视角：技术细节、工具性和社会文化性。该框架揭示了当前AI素养实践中的多样性，指出需要更精确的术语来区分不同目标，并发现某些素养目标（如批判性思维）存在研究空白。研究呼吁学界就AI素养的定义和教学设计达成更明确共识。
