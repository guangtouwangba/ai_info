# AI Literacy in K-12 and Higher Education in the Wake of Generative AI: An Integrative Review

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00079v3

## 原始摘要

Even though AI literacy has emerged as a prominent education topic in the
wake of generative AI, its definition remains vague. There is little consensus
among researchers and practitioners on how to discuss and design AI literacy
interventions. The term has been used to describe both learning activities that
train undergraduate students to use ChatGPT effectively and having kindergarten
children interact with social robots. This paper applies an integrative review
method to examine empirical and theoretical AI literacy studies published since
2020. In synthesizing the 124 reviewed studies, three ways to conceptualize
literacy-functional, critical, and indirectly beneficial-and three perspectives
on AI-technical detail, tool, and sociocultural-were identified, forming a
framework that reflects the spectrum of how AI literacy is approached in
practice. The framework highlights the need for more specialized terms within
AI literacy discourse and indicates research gaps in certain AI literacy
objectives.


## AI 摘要

AI素养的定义目前仍不明确，缺乏共识。研究者通过整合2020年以来的124项研究发现，AI素养可分为三类：功能性、批判性和间接获益性；同时存在三种视角：技术细节、工具和社会文化。这一框架揭示了实践中的多样性，例如从本科生使用ChatGPT到幼儿与社交机器人互动。研究指出需要更专业的术语来区分不同目标，并发现某些AI素养方向存在研究空白。该综述呼吁更清晰的讨论和设计标准。
