# AI Literacy in K-12 and Higher Education in the Wake of Generative AI: An Integrative Review

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00079v3

## 原始摘要

Even though AI literacy has emerged as a prominent education topic in the
wake of generative AI, its definition remains vague. There is little consensus
among researchers and practitioners on how to discuss and design AI literacy
interventions. The term has been used to describe both learning activities that
train undergraduate students to use ChatGPT effectively and having kindergarten
children interact with social robots. This paper applies an integrative review
method to examine empirical and theoretical AI literacy studies published since
2020. In synthesizing the 124 reviewed studies, three ways to conceptualize
literacy-functional, critical, and indirectly beneficial-and three perspectives
on AI-technical detail, tool, and sociocultural-were identified, forming a
framework that reflects the spectrum of how AI literacy is approached in
practice. The framework highlights the need for more specialized terms within
AI literacy discourse and indicates research gaps in certain AI literacy
objectives.


## AI 摘要

AI 素养的定义目前仍不明确，缺乏共识。研究通过整合分析 2020 年以来的 124 项相关研究，提出了三种素养概念（功能性、批判性、间接获益性）和三种 AI 视角（技术细节、工具、社会文化），形成了一个实践框架。该框架揭示了 AI 素养讨论需要更专业的术语，并指出了某些研究空白。
