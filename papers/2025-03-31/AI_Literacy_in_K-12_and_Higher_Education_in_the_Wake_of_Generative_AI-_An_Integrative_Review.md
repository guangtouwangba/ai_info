# AI Literacy in K-12 and Higher Education in the Wake of Generative AI: An Integrative Review

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00079v3

## 原始摘要

Even though AI literacy has emerged as a prominent education topic in the
wake of generative AI, its definition remains vague. There is little consensus
among researchers and practitioners on how to discuss and design AI literacy
interventions. The term has been used to describe both learning activities that
train undergraduate students to use ChatGPT effectively and having kindergarten
children interact with social robots. This paper applies an integrative review
method to examine empirical and theoretical AI literacy studies published since
2020. In synthesizing the 124 reviewed studies, three ways to conceptualize
literacy-functional, critical, and indirectly beneficial-and three perspectives
on AI-technical detail, tool, and sociocultural-were identified, forming a
framework that reflects the spectrum of how AI literacy is approached in
practice. The framework highlights the need for more specialized terms within
AI literacy discourse and indicates research gaps in certain AI literacy
objectives.


## AI 摘要

当前AI素养的定义仍较模糊，缺乏共识。本文综述了2020年以来的124项研究，提出了AI素养的三种概念化方式（功能性、批判性、间接受益性）和三种视角（技术细节、工具、社会文化），形成了一个反映实践多样性的框架。研究发现，AI素养的应用范围从大学生使用ChatGPT到幼儿与社交机器人互动不等。该框架揭示了AI素养讨论中需要更专业化的术语，并指出某些AI素养目标存在研究空白。研究呼吁更清晰的界定以指导AI素养干预措施的设计。
