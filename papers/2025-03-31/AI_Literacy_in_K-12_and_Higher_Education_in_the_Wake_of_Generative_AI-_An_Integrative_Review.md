# AI Literacy in K-12 and Higher Education in the Wake of Generative AI: An Integrative Review

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00079v3

## 原始摘要

Even though AI literacy has emerged as a prominent education topic in the
wake of generative AI, its definition remains vague. There is little consensus
among researchers and practitioners on how to discuss and design AI literacy
interventions. The term has been used to describe both learning activities that
train undergraduate students to use ChatGPT effectively and having kindergarten
children interact with social robots. This paper applies an integrative review
method to examine empirical and theoretical AI literacy studies published since
2020. In synthesizing the 124 reviewed studies, three ways to conceptualize
literacy-functional, critical, and indirectly beneficial-and three perspectives
on AI-technical detail, tool, and sociocultural-were identified, forming a
framework that reflects the spectrum of how AI literacy is approached in
practice. The framework highlights the need for more specialized terms within
AI literacy discourse and indicates research gaps in certain AI literacy
objectives.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文通过整合2020年以来的124项AI素养研究，提出了一个框架，将AI素养分为三种概念化方式（功能性、批判性、间接益处）和三种视角（技术细节、工具、社会文化）。研究发现，当前AI素养的定义模糊，应用范围广泛（从大学生使用ChatGPT到幼儿与社交机器人互动），缺乏统一标准。框架揭示了现有研究中术语的不足，并指出某些AI素养目标的研究空白。该研究呼吁在AI素养讨论中引入更专业化的术语，以促进更精准的学术对话和教育实践。
