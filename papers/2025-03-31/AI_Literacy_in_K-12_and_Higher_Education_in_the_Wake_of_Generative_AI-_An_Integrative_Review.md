# AI Literacy in K-12 and Higher Education in the Wake of Generative AI: An Integrative Review

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00079v3

## 原始摘要

Even though AI literacy has emerged as a prominent education topic in the
wake of generative AI, its definition remains vague. There is little consensus
among researchers and practitioners on how to discuss and design AI literacy
interventions. The term has been used to describe both learning activities that
train undergraduate students to use ChatGPT effectively and having kindergarten
children interact with social robots. This paper applies an integrative review
method to examine empirical and theoretical AI literacy studies published since
2020. In synthesizing the 124 reviewed studies, three ways to conceptualize
literacy-functional, critical, and indirectly beneficial-and three perspectives
on AI-technical detail, tool, and sociocultural-were identified, forming a
framework that reflects the spectrum of how AI literacy is approached in
practice. The framework highlights the need for more specialized terms within
AI literacy discourse and indicates research gaps in certain AI literacy
objectives.


## AI 摘要

尽管生成式AI的兴起使AI素养成为教育热点，但其定义仍不明确。研究者与实践者对如何讨论和设计AI素养教育缺乏共识，该术语既涵盖大学生使用ChatGPT的培训，也包括幼儿与社交机器人的互动。一项整合性综述分析了2020年以来的124项研究，提出AI素养的三种概念化方式（功能性、批判性、间接获益性）和三种AI视角（技术细节、工具、社会文化），形成反映实践差异的框架。该框架揭示了需要更精确的术语，并指出某些AI素养目标存在研究空白。
