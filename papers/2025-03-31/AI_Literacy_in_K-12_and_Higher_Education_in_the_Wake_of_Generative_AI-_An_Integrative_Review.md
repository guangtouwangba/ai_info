# AI Literacy in K-12 and Higher Education in the Wake of Generative AI: An Integrative Review

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00079v3

## 原始摘要

Even though AI literacy has emerged as a prominent education topic in the
wake of generative AI, its definition remains vague. There is little consensus
among researchers and practitioners on how to discuss and design AI literacy
interventions. The term has been used to describe both learning activities that
train undergraduate students to use ChatGPT effectively and having kindergarten
children interact with social robots. This paper applies an integrative review
method to examine empirical and theoretical AI literacy studies published since
2020. In synthesizing the 124 reviewed studies, three ways to conceptualize
literacy-functional, critical, and indirectly beneficial-and three perspectives
on AI-technical detail, tool, and sociocultural-were identified, forming a
framework that reflects the spectrum of how AI literacy is approached in
practice. The framework highlights the need for more specialized terms within
AI literacy discourse and indicates research gaps in certain AI literacy
objectives.


## AI 摘要

当前，AI素养的定义仍不明确，缺乏统一框架。本文通过综述2020年以来的124项研究发现，AI素养可从三个维度理解：功能性（技能培养）、批判性（反思能力）和间接获益性（社会影响）；同时存在三种视角：技术细节、工具应用和社会文化。研究指出，实践中AI素养的覆盖范围极广，从大学生使用ChatGPT到幼儿与社交机器人互动均被纳入。框架揭示了现有术语的局限性，并发现某些AI素养目标（如伦理教育）存在研究空白，呼吁更精准的术语体系和针对性研究。
