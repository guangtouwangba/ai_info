# AI Literacy in K-12 and Higher Education in the Wake of Generative AI: An Integrative Review

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00079v3

## 原始摘要

Even though AI literacy has emerged as a prominent education topic in the
wake of generative AI, its definition remains vague. There is little consensus
among researchers and practitioners on how to discuss and design AI literacy
interventions. The term has been used to describe both learning activities that
train undergraduate students to use ChatGPT effectively and having kindergarten
children interact with social robots. This paper applies an integrative review
method to examine empirical and theoretical AI literacy studies published since
2020. In synthesizing the 124 reviewed studies, three ways to conceptualize
literacy-functional, critical, and indirectly beneficial-and three perspectives
on AI-technical detail, tool, and sociocultural-were identified, forming a
framework that reflects the spectrum of how AI literacy is approached in
practice. The framework highlights the need for more specialized terms within
AI literacy discourse and indicates research gaps in certain AI literacy
objectives.


## AI 摘要

当前AI素养的定义仍不明确，缺乏共识。本文通过综述2020年以来的124项研究，提出了AI素养的三种概念化方式（功能性、批判性、间接获益性）和三种视角（技术细节、工具、社会文化），构建了一个反映实践多样性的框架。研究发现AI素养讨论需要更专业化的术语，并指出某些目标领域存在研究空白。该框架有助于厘清从幼儿社交机器人互动到大学生ChatGPT应用等广泛场景中的AI素养教育设计。
