# AI Literacy in K-12 and Higher Education in the Wake of Generative AI: An Integrative Review

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00079v3

## 原始摘要

Even though AI literacy has emerged as a prominent education topic in the
wake of generative AI, its definition remains vague. There is little consensus
among researchers and practitioners on how to discuss and design AI literacy
interventions. The term has been used to describe both learning activities that
train undergraduate students to use ChatGPT effectively and having kindergarten
children interact with social robots. This paper applies an integrative review
method to examine empirical and theoretical AI literacy studies published since
2020. In synthesizing the 124 reviewed studies, three ways to conceptualize
literacy-functional, critical, and indirectly beneficial-and three perspectives
on AI-technical detail, tool, and sociocultural-were identified, forming a
framework that reflects the spectrum of how AI literacy is approached in
practice. The framework highlights the need for more specialized terms within
AI literacy discourse and indicates research gaps in certain AI literacy
objectives.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文通过整合2020年以来的124项研究，提出了AI素养的三种概念化方式（功能性、批判性、间接效益性）和三种视角（技术细节、工具、社会文化），构建了一个反映AI素养实践多样性的框架。研究发现当前AI素养定义模糊，应用范围从大学生使用ChatGPT到幼儿与社交机器人互动，缺乏统一标准。该框架揭示了需要更精确的术语来区分不同AI素养目标，并指出某些领域的研究空白。研究呼吁学界就AI素养的定义和教学设计达成更明确的共识。
