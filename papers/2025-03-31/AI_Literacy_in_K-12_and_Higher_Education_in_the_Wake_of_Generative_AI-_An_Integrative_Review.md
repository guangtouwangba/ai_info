# AI Literacy in K-12 and Higher Education in the Wake of Generative AI: An Integrative Review

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00079v3

## 原始摘要

Even though AI literacy has emerged as a prominent education topic in the
wake of generative AI, its definition remains vague. There is little consensus
among researchers and practitioners on how to discuss and design AI literacy
interventions. The term has been used to describe both learning activities that
train undergraduate students to use ChatGPT effectively and having kindergarten
children interact with social robots. This paper applies an integrative review
method to examine empirical and theoretical AI literacy studies published since
2020. In synthesizing the 124 reviewed studies, three ways to conceptualize
literacy-functional, critical, and indirectly beneficial-and three perspectives
on AI-technical detail, tool, and sociocultural-were identified, forming a
framework that reflects the spectrum of how AI literacy is approached in
practice. The framework highlights the need for more specialized terms within
AI literacy discourse and indicates research gaps in certain AI literacy
objectives.


## AI 摘要

当前，AI素养的定义仍不明确，缺乏共识。研究者通过整合分析2020年以来的124项研究发现，AI素养可分为三类：功能性（如使用ChatGPT）、批判性（如伦理思考）和间接获益性（如社会影响）；同时存在技术细节、工具和社会文化三种视角。这一框架揭示了实践中的多样性，并指出需要更精确的术语来区分不同目标，尤其是某些领域（如低龄教育）的研究仍存在空白。该研究呼吁更系统化的AI素养讨论与设计。
