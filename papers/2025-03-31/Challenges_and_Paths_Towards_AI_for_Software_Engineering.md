# Challenges and Paths Towards AI for Software Engineering

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22625v1

## 原始摘要

AI for software engineering has made remarkable progress recently, becoming a
notable success within generative AI. Despite this, there are still many
challenges that need to be addressed before automated software engineering
reaches its full potential. It should be possible to reach high levels of
automation where humans can focus on the critical decisions of what to build
and how to balance difficult tradeoffs while most routine development effort is
automated away. Reaching this level of automation will require substantial
research and engineering efforts across academia and industry. In this paper,
we aim to discuss progress towards this in a threefold manner. First, we
provide a structured taxonomy of concrete tasks in AI for software engineering,
emphasizing the many other tasks in software engineering beyond code generation
and completion. Second, we outline several key bottlenecks that limit current
approaches. Finally, we provide an opinionated list of promising research
directions toward making progress on these bottlenecks, hoping to inspire
future research in this rapidly maturing field.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文探讨了AI在软件工程领域的进展与挑战。尽管AI辅助编程已取得显著成果，但要实现高度自动化仍需突破多个瓶颈。作者提出三方面观点：1) 系统梳理了AI软件工程任务分类，指出除代码生成外还有更多待开发领域；2) 分析了当前方法的主要限制因素；3) 列出有前景的研究方向，为学术界和产业界提供参考。最终目标是实现人类专注关键决策、AI处理常规开发的协作模式，这需要跨领域的持续研究投入。文章旨在为该快速发展的领域提供结构化思考框架。
