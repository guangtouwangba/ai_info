# Challenges and Paths Towards AI for Software Engineering

## 原始摘要

AI for software engineering has made remarkable progress recently, becoming a
notable success within generative AI. Despite this, there are still many
challenges that need to be addressed before automated software engineering
reaches its full potential. It should be possible to reach high levels of
automation where humans can focus on the critical decisions of what to build
and how to balance difficult tradeoffs while most routine development effort is
automated away. Reaching this level of automation will require substantial
research and engineering efforts across academia and industry. In this paper,
we aim to discuss progress towards this in a threefold manner. First, we
provide a structured taxonomy of concrete tasks in AI for software engineering,
emphasizing the many other tasks in software engineering beyond code generation
and completion. Second, we outline several key bottlenecks that limit current
approaches. Finally, we provide an opinionated list of promising research
directions toward making progress on these bottlenecks, hoping to inspire
future research in this rapidly maturing field.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文探讨了AI在软件工程领域的进展与挑战。尽管AI在代码生成和补全方面取得了显著成功，但要实现高度自动化仍需解决诸多问题。作者提出了三方面内容：首先，建立了软件工程中AI任务的结构化分类法，强调除代码生成外还有许多其他任务；其次，指出了当前方法的主要瓶颈；最后，列出了有前景的研究方向，以推动解决这些瓶颈。论文旨在激发学术界和工业界共同努力，最终实现人类专注于关键决策、AI处理常规开发工作的理想自动化水平。
