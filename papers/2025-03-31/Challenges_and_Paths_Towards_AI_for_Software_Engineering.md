## 原始摘要

AI for software engineering has made remarkable progress recently, becoming a
notable success within generative AI. Despite this, there are still many
challenges that need to be addressed before automated software engineering
reaches its full potential. It should be possible to reach high levels of
automation where humans can focus on the critical decisions of what to build
and how to balance difficult tradeoffs while most routine development effort is
automated away. Reaching this level of automation will require substantial
research and engineering efforts across academia and industry. In this paper,
we aim to discuss progress towards this in a threefold manner. First, we
provide a structured taxonomy of concrete tasks in AI for software engineering,
emphasizing the many other tasks in software engineering beyond code generation
and completion. Second, we outline several key bottlenecks that limit current
approaches. Finally, we provide an opinionated list of promising research
directions toward making progress on these bottlenecks, hoping to inspire
future research in this rapidly maturing field.


## AI 摘要

人工智能在软件工程领域取得了显著进展，成为生成式AI的重要成功案例。然而，要实现自动化软件工程的全面潜力仍需解决诸多挑战。理想状态下，人类可以专注于关键决策和权衡，而常规开发工作则由AI自动化完成。实现这一目标需要学术界和工业界的共同努力。本文从三方面展开讨论：首先，提出软件工程中AI任务的结构化分类，强调除代码生成外的其他重要任务；其次，指出当前方法的主要瓶颈；最后，列出有前景的研究方向，以推动这一快速发展领域的未来研究。
