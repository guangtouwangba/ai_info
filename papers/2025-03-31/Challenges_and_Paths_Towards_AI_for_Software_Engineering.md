# Challenges and Paths Towards AI for Software Engineering

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22625v1

## 原始摘要

AI for software engineering has made remarkable progress recently, becoming a
notable success within generative AI. Despite this, there are still many
challenges that need to be addressed before automated software engineering
reaches its full potential. It should be possible to reach high levels of
automation where humans can focus on the critical decisions of what to build
and how to balance difficult tradeoffs while most routine development effort is
automated away. Reaching this level of automation will require substantial
research and engineering efforts across academia and industry. In this paper,
we aim to discuss progress towards this in a threefold manner. First, we
provide a structured taxonomy of concrete tasks in AI for software engineering,
emphasizing the many other tasks in software engineering beyond code generation
and completion. Second, we outline several key bottlenecks that limit current
approaches. Finally, we provide an opinionated list of promising research
directions toward making progress on these bottlenecks, hoping to inspire
future research in this rapidly maturing field.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文探讨了AI在软件工程领域的进展与挑战。尽管AI辅助编程已取得显著成果，但要实现高度自动化仍需突破多个瓶颈。作者提出三方面分析：首先构建了软件工程AI任务的分类体系，强调除代码生成外还存在多种任务；其次指出了当前方法的关键限制因素；最后列出有前景的研究方向，以期推动该领域发展。最终目标是让人类专注于关键决策，而自动化处理常规开发工作。这需要学术界和工业界的共同努力。
