# Challenges and Paths Towards AI for Software Engineering

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22625v1

## 原始摘要

AI for software engineering has made remarkable progress recently, becoming a
notable success within generative AI. Despite this, there are still many
challenges that need to be addressed before automated software engineering
reaches its full potential. It should be possible to reach high levels of
automation where humans can focus on the critical decisions of what to build
and how to balance difficult tradeoffs while most routine development effort is
automated away. Reaching this level of automation will require substantial
research and engineering efforts across academia and industry. In this paper,
we aim to discuss progress towards this in a threefold manner. First, we
provide a structured taxonomy of concrete tasks in AI for software engineering,
emphasizing the many other tasks in software engineering beyond code generation
and completion. Second, we outline several key bottlenecks that limit current
approaches. Finally, we provide an opinionated list of promising research
directions toward making progress on these bottlenecks, hoping to inspire
future research in this rapidly maturing field.


## AI 摘要

这篇论文探讨了AI在软件工程领域的进展与挑战。尽管AI在代码生成和补全方面取得了显著成功，但要实现高度自动化仍需突破多项瓶颈。作者提出三方面讨论：1) 构建软件工程AI任务分类体系，强调除代码生成外还有更多待解决问题；2) 分析当前方法的关键限制因素；3) 列出有前景的研究方向以突破这些限制。最终目标是让人类专注于关键决策，而将常规开发工作自动化。这需要学术界和工业界的共同努力，推动该快速发展的领域走向成熟。
