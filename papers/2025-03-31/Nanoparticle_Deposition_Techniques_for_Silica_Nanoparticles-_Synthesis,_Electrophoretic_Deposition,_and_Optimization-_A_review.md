**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22593v1

## 原始摘要

Silica nanoparticles have emerged as key building blocks for advanced
applications in electronics, catalysis, energy storage, biomedicine, and
environmental science. In this review, we focus on recent developments in both
the synthesis and deposition of these nanoparticles, emphasizing the widely
used St\"ober method and the versatile technique of electrophoretic deposition
(EPD). The St\"ober method is celebrated for its simplicity and reliability,
offering precise control over particle size, morphology, and surface properties
to produce uniform, monodisperse silica nanoparticles that meet high-quality
standards for advanced applications. EPD, on the other hand, is a
cost-effective, room-temperature process that enables uniform coatings on
substrates with complex geometries. When compared to traditional techniques
such as chemical vapor deposition, atomic layer deposition, and spin coating,
EPD stands out due to its scalability, enhanced material compatibility, and
ease of processing. Moreover, Future research should integrate AI-driven
optimization with active learning to enhance electrophoretic deposition (EPD)
of silica nanoparticles, leveraging predictive modeling and real-time
adjustments for improved film quality and process efficiency. This approach
promises to accelerate material discovery and enable scalable nanofabrication
of advanced functional films.
