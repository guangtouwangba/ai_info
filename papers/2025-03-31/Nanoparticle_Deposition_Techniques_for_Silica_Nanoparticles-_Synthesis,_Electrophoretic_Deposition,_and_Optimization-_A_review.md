**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22593v1

## 原始摘要

Silica nanoparticles have emerged as key building blocks for advanced
applications in electronics, catalysis, energy storage, biomedicine, and
environmental science. In this review, we focus on recent developments in both
the synthesis and deposition of these nanoparticles, emphasizing the widely
used St\"ober method and the versatile technique of electrophoretic deposition
(EPD). The St\"ober method is celebrated for its simplicity and reliability,
offering precise control over particle size, morphology, and surface properties
to produce uniform, monodisperse silica nanoparticles that meet high-quality
standards for advanced applications. EPD, on the other hand, is a
cost-effective, room-temperature process that enables uniform coatings on
substrates with complex geometries. When compared to traditional techniques
such as chemical vapor deposition, atomic layer deposition, and spin coating,
EPD stands out due to its scalability, enhanced material compatibility, and
ease of processing. Moreover, Future research should integrate AI-driven
optimization with active learning to enhance electrophoretic deposition (EPD)
of silica nanoparticles, leveraging predictive modeling and real-time
adjustments for improved film quality and process efficiency. This approach
promises to accelerate material discovery and enable scalable nanofabrication
of advanced functional films.


## AI 摘要

二氧化硅纳米颗粒在电子、催化、能源、生物医学和环境科学等领域具有重要应用。本文综述了其合成与沉积技术的最新进展，重点介绍了经典的Stöber法和电泳沉积(EPD)技术。Stöber法操作简单可靠，可精确控制颗粒尺寸、形貌和表面性质，制备出高质量单分散纳米颗粒。EPD作为一种低成本室温工艺，能在复杂基底上实现均匀涂覆，相比传统方法更具可扩展性和材料兼容性。未来研究建议结合人工智能优化和主动学习技术，通过预测建模和实时调控提升EPD工艺的薄膜质量和效率，推动功能性纳米薄膜的规模化制备。
