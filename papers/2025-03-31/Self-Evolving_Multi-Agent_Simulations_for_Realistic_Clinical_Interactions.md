# Self-Evolving Multi-Agent Simulations for Realistic Clinical Interactions

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22678v1

## 原始摘要

In this work, we introduce MedAgentSim, an open-source simulated clinical
environment with doctor, patient, and measurement agents designed to evaluate
and enhance LLM performance in dynamic diagnostic settings. Unlike prior
approaches, our framework requires doctor agents to actively engage with
patients through multi-turn conversations, requesting relevant medical
examinations (e.g., temperature, blood pressure, ECG) and imaging results
(e.g., MRI, X-ray) from a measurement agent to mimic the real-world diagnostic
process. Additionally, we incorporate self improvement mechanisms that allow
models to iteratively refine their diagnostic strategies. We enhance LLM
performance in our simulated setting by integrating multi-agent discussions,
chain-of-thought reasoning, and experience-based knowledge retrieval,
facilitating progressive learning as doctor agents interact with more patients.
We also introduce an evaluation benchmark for assessing the LLM's ability to
engage in dynamic, context-aware diagnostic interactions. While MedAgentSim is
fully automated, it also supports a user-controlled mode, enabling human
interaction with either the doctor or patient agent. Comprehensive evaluations
in various simulated diagnostic scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. Our code, simulation tool, and benchmark are available at
