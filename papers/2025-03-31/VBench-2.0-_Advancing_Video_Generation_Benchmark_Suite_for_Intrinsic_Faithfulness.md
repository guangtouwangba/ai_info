# VBench-2.0: Advancing Video Generation Benchmark Suite for Intrinsic Faithfulness

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21755v1

## 原始摘要

Video generation has advanced significantly, evolving from producing
unrealistic outputs to generating videos that appear visually convincing and
temporally coherent. To evaluate these video generative models, benchmarks such
as VBench have been developed to assess their faithfulness, measuring factors
like per-frame aesthetics, temporal consistency, and basic prompt adherence.
However, these aspects mainly represent superficial faithfulness, which focus
on whether the video appears visually convincing rather than whether it adheres
to real-world principles. While recent models perform increasingly well on
these metrics, they still struggle to generate videos that are not just
visually plausible but fundamentally realistic. To achieve real "world models"
through video generation, the next frontier lies in intrinsic faithfulness to
ensure that generated videos adhere to physical laws, commonsense reasoning,
anatomical correctness, and compositional integrity. Achieving this level of
realism is essential for applications such as AI-assisted filmmaking and
simulated world modeling. To bridge this gap, we introduce VBench-2.0, a
next-generation benchmark designed to automatically evaluate video generative
models for their intrinsic faithfulness. VBench-2.0 assesses five key
dimensions: Human Fidelity, Controllability, Creativity, Physics, and
Commonsense, each further broken down into fine-grained capabilities. Tailored
for individual dimensions, our evaluation framework integrates generalists such
as state-of-the-art VLMs and LLMs, and specialists, including anomaly detection
methods proposed for video generation. We conduct extensive annotations to
ensure alignment with human judgment. By pushing beyond superficial
faithfulness toward intrinsic faithfulness, VBench-2.0 aims to set a new
standard for the next generation of video generative models in pursuit of
intrinsic faithfulness.


## AI 摘要

视频生成技术已从早期不真实的输出发展到能生成视觉逼真且时序连贯的视频。现有评测基准（如VBench）主要评估表面真实性（如单帧美感、时序一致性），但忽视了内在真实性（如物理规律、常识推理）。为此，研究者提出VBench-2.0新基准，通过五大维度（人体真实度、可控性、创造性、物理合理性、常识性）系统评估视频生成模型的内在真实性。该框架结合通用视觉语言模型和专用异常检测方法，并通过人工标注验证。VBench-2.0旨在为追求内在真实性的新一代视频生成模型建立评测标准，推动其在影视制作和虚拟世界建模中的应用。
