# A RAG-Based Multi-Agent LLM System for Natural Hazard Resilience and Adaptation

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07877v3

## 原始摘要

Large language models (LLMs) are a transformational capability at the
frontier of artificial intelligence and machine learning that can support
decision-makers in addressing pressing societal challenges such as extreme
natural hazard events. As generalized models, LLMs often struggle to provide
context-specific information, particularly in areas requiring specialized
knowledge. In this work, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG)-based multi-agent LLM system to support analysis and decision-making in
the context of natural hazards and extreme weather events. As a proof of
concept, we present WildfireGPT, a specialized system focused on wildfire
scenarios. The architecture employs a user-centered, multi-agent design to
deliver tailored risk insights across diverse stakeholder groups. By
integrating domain-specific projection data, observational datasets, and
scientific literature through a RAG framework, the system ensures both accuracy
and contextual relevance of the information it provides. Evaluation across ten
expert-led case studies demonstrates that WildfireGPT significantly outperforms
existing LLM-based solutions for decision support in natural hazard and extreme
weather contexts.
