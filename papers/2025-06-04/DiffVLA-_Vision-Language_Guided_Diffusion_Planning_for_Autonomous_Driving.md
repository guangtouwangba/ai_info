# DiffVLA: Vision-Language Guided Diffusion Planning for Autonomous Driving

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19381v4

## 原始摘要

Research interest in end-to-end autonomous driving has surged owing to its
fully differentiable design integrating modular tasks, i.e. perception,
prediction and planing, which enables optimization in pursuit of the ultimate
goal. Despite the great potential of the end-to-end paradigm, existing methods
suffer from several aspects including expensive BEV (bird's eye view)
computation, action diversity, and sub-optimal decision in complex real-world
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid sparse-dense
diffusion policy, empowered by a Vision-Language Model (VLM), called Diff-VLA.
We explore the sparse diffusion representation for efficient multi-modal
driving behavior. Moreover, we rethink the effectiveness of VLM driving
decision and improve the trajectory generation guidance through deep
interaction across agent, map instances and VLM output. Our method shows
superior performance in Autonomous Grand Challenge 2025 which contains
challenging real and reactive synthetic scenarios. Our methods achieves 45.0
PDMS.


## AI 摘要

Diff-VLA提出了一种新型混合稀疏-稠密扩散策略，结合视觉语言模型(VLM)来解决端到端自动驾驶的挑战。该方法通过稀疏扩散表示实现高效多模态驾驶行为，并利用VLM增强决策能力，优化轨迹生成指导。相比现有方法，Diff-VLA避免了昂贵的鸟瞰图计算，改善了复杂场景下的决策质量。在包含真实和合成场景的Autonomous Grand Challenge 2025测试中，该方法表现出色，取得了45.0 PDMS的优异性能，有效解决了行为多样性、计算效率和复杂场景决策等关键问题。
