# Let Androids Dream of Electric Sheep: A Human-like Image Implication Understanding and Reasoning Framework

## 原始摘要

Metaphorical comprehension in images remains a critical challenge for AI
systems, as existing models struggle to grasp the nuanced cultural, emotional,
and contextual implications embedded in visual content. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) excel in basic Visual Question Answer (VQA) tasks, they
struggle with a fundamental limitation on image implication tasks: contextual
gaps that obscure the relationships between different visual elements and their
abstract meanings. Inspired by the human cognitive process, we propose Let
Androids Dream (LAD), a novel framework for image implication understanding and
reasoning. LAD addresses contextual missing through the three-stage framework:
(1) Perception: converting visual information into rich and multi-level textual
representations, (2) Search: iteratively searching and integrating cross-domain
knowledge to resolve ambiguity, and (3) Reasoning: generating context-alignment
image implication via explicit reasoning. Our framework with the lightweight
GPT-4o-mini model achieves SOTA performance compared to 15+ MLLMs on English
image implication benchmark and a huge improvement on Chinese benchmark,
performing comparable with the GPT-4o model on Multiple-Choice Question (MCQ)
and outperforms 36.7% on Open-Style Question (OSQ). Additionally, our work
provides new insights into how AI can more effectively interpret image
implications, advancing the field of vision-language reasoning and human-AI
interaction. Our project is publicly available at

## AI 摘要

论文提出Let Androids Dream (LAD)框架，解决AI系统在图像隐喻理解上的关键挑战。现有多模态大模型(MLLMs)在视觉问答任务表现良好，但难以捕捉视觉元素间的抽象关联。LAD模仿人类认知过程，通过三阶段框架：感知(将视觉信息转为多层级文本表征)、搜索(整合跨领域知识消除歧义)、推理(生成语境对齐的隐含意义)。实验显示，轻量级GPT-4o-mini搭载LAD框架在英汉图像隐喻基准测试中超越15+个MLLMs，在开放式问答上性能提升36.7%。该研究为提升AI视觉语言推理能力提供了新思路。项目已开源。
