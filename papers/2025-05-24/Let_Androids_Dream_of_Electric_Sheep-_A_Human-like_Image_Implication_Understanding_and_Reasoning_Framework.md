# Let Androids Dream of Electric Sheep: A Human-like Image Implication Understanding and Reasoning Framework

## 原始摘要

Metaphorical comprehension in images remains a critical challenge for AI
systems, as existing models struggle to grasp the nuanced cultural, emotional,
and contextual implications embedded in visual content. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) excel in basic Visual Question Answer (VQA) tasks, they
struggle with a fundamental limitation on image implication tasks: contextual
gaps that obscure the relationships between different visual elements and their
abstract meanings. Inspired by the human cognitive process, we propose Let
Androids Dream (LAD), a novel framework for image implication understanding and
reasoning. LAD addresses contextual missing through the three-stage framework:
(1) Perception: converting visual information into rich and multi-level textual
representations, (2) Search: iteratively searching and integrating cross-domain
knowledge to resolve ambiguity, and (3) Reasoning: generating context-alignment
image implication via explicit reasoning. Our framework with the lightweight
GPT-4o-mini model achieves SOTA performance compared to 15+ MLLMs on English
image implication benchmark and a huge improvement on Chinese benchmark,
performing comparable with the GPT-4o model on Multiple-Choice Question (MCQ)
and outperforms 36.7% on Open-Style Question (OSQ). Additionally, our work
provides new insights into how AI can more effectively interpret image
implications, advancing the field of vision-language reasoning and human-AI
interaction. Our project is publicly available at

## AI 摘要

本文提出了一种名为Let Androids Dream (LAD)的新型框架，用于解决AI系统在图像隐喻理解上的关键挑战。LAD通过三阶段流程（感知、搜索、推理）弥补现有多模态大语言模型在视觉隐含意义理解上的上下文缺失问题。实验表明，该框架配合轻量级GPT-4o-mini模型，在英文图像隐喻基准测试中超越15+个MLLMs，中文测试表现显著提升，在选择题上与GPT-4o相当，开放式问题性能高出36.7%。这项工作为提升AI图像隐喻理解能力提供了新思路，推动了视觉-语言推理领域发展。项目已开源。
