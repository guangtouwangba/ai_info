# SpatialScore: Towards Unified Evaluation for Multimodal Spatial Understanding

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17012v1

## 原始摘要

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive success in
question-answering tasks, yet their capabilities for spatial understanding are
less explored. This work investigates a critical question: do existing MLLMs
possess 3D spatial perception and understanding abilities? Concretely, we make
the following contributions in this paper: (i) we introduce VGBench, a
benchmark specifically designed to assess MLLMs for visual geometry perception,
e.g., camera pose and motion estimation; (ii) we propose SpatialScore, the most
comprehensive and diverse multimodal spatial understanding benchmark to date,
integrating VGBench with relevant data from the other 11 existing datasets.
This benchmark comprises 28K samples across various spatial understanding
tasks, modalities, and QA formats, along with a carefully curated challenging
subset, SpatialScore-Hard; (iii) we develop SpatialAgent, a novel multi-agent
system incorporating 9 specialized tools for spatial understanding, supporting
both Plan-Execute and ReAct reasoning paradigms; (iv) we conduct extensive
evaluations to reveal persistent challenges in spatial reasoning while
demonstrating the effectiveness of SpatialAgent. We believe SpatialScore will
offer valuable insights and serve as a rigorous benchmark for the next
evolution of MLLMs.


## AI 摘要

该研究探讨了多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)的3D空间感知能力，提出了VGBench评估视觉几何感知(如相机位姿估计)，并整合12个数据集构建了迄今最全面的空间理解基准SpatialScore(含28K样本和困难子集SpatialScore-Hard)。同时开发了支持9种专用工具的多智能体系统SpatialAgent，支持Plan-Execute和ReAct推理模式。实验表明当前MLLMs在空间推理方面仍存在挑战，而SpatialAgent表现优异。该基准将为MLLMs的下一代发展提供重要参考。(99字)
