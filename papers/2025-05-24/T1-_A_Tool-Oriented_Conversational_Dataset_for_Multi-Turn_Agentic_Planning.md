# T1: A Tool-Oriented Conversational Dataset for Multi-Turn Agentic Planning

**URL**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16986v1

## 原始摘要

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities as
intelligent agents capable of solving complex problems. However, effective
planning in scenarios involving dependencies between API or tool
calls-particularly in multi-turn conversations-remains a significant challenge.
To address this, we introduce T1, a tool-augmented, multi-domain, multi-turn
conversational dataset specifically designed to capture and manage inter-tool
dependencies across diverse domains. T1 enables rigorous evaluation of agents'
ability to coordinate tool use across nine distinct domains (4 single domain
and 5 multi-domain) with the help of an integrated caching mechanism for both
short- and long-term memory, while supporting dynamic replanning-such as
deciding whether to recompute or reuse cached results. Beyond facilitating
research on tool use and planning, T1 also serves as a benchmark for evaluating
the performance of open-source language models. We present results powered by
T1-Agent, highlighting their ability to plan and reason in complex,
tool-dependent scenarios.


## AI 摘要

研究人员开发了名为T1的多领域多轮对话数据集，旨在解决大语言模型(LLM)在API/工具调用依赖关系中的规划难题。T1包含9个领域(4单领域+5跨领域)任务，通过集成短期/长期记忆缓存机制，支持动态重新规划(如决定重新计算或重用缓存结果)。该数据集不仅推动工具使用和规划研究，还可作为开源语言模型的评估基准。基于T1-Agent的实验结果表明，该系统能有效处理复杂工具依赖场景下的规划和推理任务。
